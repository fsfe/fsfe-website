<!-- Introduction -->
	<div><h2 id="sec-1">1. Introduction</h2>
		<div>
			<p>The purpose of this document is to provide input on a number of
			specific questions to the team tasked with updating the EC's Open
			Source Strategy, which is meant to guide the decisions of those in
			charge of the Commission's IT systems and IT procurement, with respect
			to contributing and releasing software under a Free Software license.<sup>
			<a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> The	ultimate goal
			of this paper is to enable the European Commission to maximise the
			value for money it obtains from its IT systems, by leveraging the
			advantages of Free Software and open file formats.</p>
			
			<p>This document does not constitute legal advice. If legal advice from a
			specialist is required, FSFE will be honoured to facilitate contacts
			with competent lawyers.</p>
			
			<p>While in this document we focus on the European Commission, the
			information contained herein applies equally to other EU institutions,
			as well as to public bodies more generally.</p>
			
			
			<p>The terms "Free Software" and "open source software" both refer to
			computer programs which recipients may <a href="http://fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html">
			use, study, share, and improve</a>. In this document, the term "Free
			Software" is preferred. Both terms cover the same set of programs<sup>
			<a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

<!-- Contributing to external Free Software projects -->	
	<div><h2 id="sec-2">2. Contributing to external Free Software projects</h2>
		<div>
		<p>The Commission, and other European institutions, are currently
		making use of numerous Free Software programs and applications
		<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>.
		At the same time, the Commission admits that it is "in a situation
		of effective captivity with Microsoft as regards its desktop
		operating systems and office productivity tools"<sup><a id="fnr.4"
		name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>. Making
		greater use of Free Software tools is an essential step in loosening
		the bonds of this captivity. In addition, the Commission's IT
		services are adapting, patching and improving Free Software
		programs for their own use. If the European Commission contributes
		to outside Free Software tools which it uses itself, those
		contributions will help to make	those tools more useful, quickly
		and in a cost-effective manner.</p>
	
		<p>Permitting such contributions is the most cost-effective way of
		improving the tools that the Commission is using. Ideally, these
		contributions will become part of the mainline project; this would
		eliminate the need for the Commission's developers to repeatedly apply
		Commission-specific patches to subsequent versions of the programs in
		question, freeing up their time for more useful tasks. (It should be
		noted that such improvements are out of the question with non-free
		software; here, the Commission is fully dependent on the vendor of the
		program for any fixes or improvements.</p>
		
		<p>Already in 2005, the Commission published a "Guideline for Public
		Administrations on Partnering with Free Software Developers"
		<sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>, which
		remains a useful resource.</p>
				
		<p>It is useful to distinguish between contributing to an external
		project as a way to improve it (e.g. by providing upstream patches and
		modules), and releasing an internally-developed program to the public
		under a Free Software license.</p>
		
		<p>Contributions to an existing project are only a matter of internal
		organization of the Commission. Contrary to what happens if the public
		entity distributes software under a closed or "proprietary" license
		software which may compete with existing applications in the same
		market, contributing to a public Free Software project does not put
		the Commission in a situation of competition with commercial actors.</p></div>
	</div>

	<div><h3 id="sec-2-1">2.1. Clarify copyright ownership among EC and agencies</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Currently, the copyright on code and documentation created
			by Commission staff is held by the Commission. The contracts
			with service suppliers normally state that all software
			developed for the Commission in the context of the contract
			is owned by the	Commission. The relevant director-general 
			decides on issues related to copyright and trademarks, after
			having consulted the legal service and the Joint Research
			Centre.</p>
			
			<p>When contributions are created by contractors external to
			the Commission, copyright ownership will depend on the terms
			of the contract in question. Where the Commission holds
			copyright on the work created under these contracts, it may
			decide to distribute the work in question under a Free
			Software license of its choice.</p>
			
			<p>Alternatively, the EC could choose to let copyright in
			the newly created code and documentation remain with the
			contractor, and impose a contractual obligation for the
			contractor to publish these assets in a suitable manner under
			a Free Software license (and perhaps participate in their
			maintenance for a specified period of time).</p>
			
			<p>As the expert on the specific project, the contractor is
			in a much better position to handle the distribution of the
			software and documentation in a productive and sustainable
			way, by bringing the necessary technical and legal expertise
			to bear. At the same time, it is important to recognise that
			distributing software is not among the Commission's primary
			responsibilities; this task should therefore be handled in
			the most efficient manner possible. For this approach to work,
			the Commission however needs to set the right requirements
			and	incentives. (This is an approach adopted in Sweden, for
			example.)</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div><h3 id="sec-2-2">2.2. Create a policy</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Contributions to outside Free Software projects by
			developers working for the Commission could be enabled
			through a simple policy signed by the relevant Director
			General. This policy could be approved after consultation
			with the legal service and the joint research centre.</p>
			
			<p>As an important first step, the EC should state publicly
			that developers working on Commission software projects and
			using or implementing Free Software solutions can contribute
			to the upstream	projects any bug fixes and new functionality.</p>
			
			<p>Where a more explicit policy is required, it should be as
			simple as possible, both in administrative and linguistic
			terms. The policy should contain the following elements:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Rationale for the policy
					<ul>
						<li>e.g. Free Software serves to avoid lock-in,
						and	enables a more effective IT strategies in
						the public sector.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>Operational part, describing steps that developers
				should follow:
					<ul>
						<li>Identification of the Free Software project
						to which developers will contribute (the "target
						project")</li>
						
						<li>Identification of copyright and trademark
						ownership regime for potential contributions from
						the EC</li>
			
						<li>Identification of the target project's license
						and contribution policy</li>
			
						<li>Identification of person(s) involved in the
						process, and their approval (if required)</li>
			
						<li>Identification of required documentation</li>
			
						<li>Example header files</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>For cases where explicit approval is required, the policy
			should stipulate a clear approval path, a time period during
			which the developer can expect to receive approval, e.g. one
			week.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
			
	<div><h3 id="sec-2-3">2.3. Make contributing simple</h3>
		<div>
			<p>If useful adaptations of software tools to the Commission's
			needs are actually to occur, making such improvements simple
			is the first step. In order to ensure that these improvements
			will be contained in future versions of the outside project,
			it is important to simplify the process for developers to
			contribute these improvements "upstream" to the outside project
			<sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>.</p>
			
			<p>We recommend to use the above-mentioned policy to give
			developers working for the Commission and other European
			institutions blanket permissions for small contributions
			that are directly related to Free Software projects which
			are currently in use within the institution in question.</p>
			
			<p>For more substantial contributions, or in cases where the
			usefulness of the contribution requires further explanation,
			we suggest that the Commission Free Software policy should
			outline and set up a simple, efficient approval process.
			This process should provide developers with a clear decision
			path, and a clear timeline indicating how long after their
			inquiry they can expect to receive a decision.</p>
			
			<p>In order to make the process efficient, we recommend to
			apply the Commission's rules on public statements by its
			employees in a sensible manner. As a rule, source code does
			not serve to convey	views or opinions. Concerns that
			developers through their contributions might make statements
			that would be potentially damaging to the Commission are in 
			our view largely unwarranted. While it is theoretically
			conceivable that a developer might choose to make damaging
			statements as part of his or her contribution, current
			Commission employment rules and policies provide ample means
			to handle any such incidents, in the very unlikely case that
			they were to occur at all.</p>
			
			<p>Theoretically, one could argue that while the
			contributions will not convey views or opinions, the fact
			that the Commission contributes to a particular Free Software
			product may be conceived as a statement of support/approval
			of this product. While the author has never once encountered
			this sort of problem in practice during the past 10	years,
			such concerns could be addressed with a public disclaimer
			posted alongside an explanation of the Commission's contribution
			policy, or even alongside the updated Open Source Strategy.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div><h3 id="sec-2-3">2.4. Incentivise developers to contribute</h3>
		<div>
			<p>If useful adaptations of software tools to the Commission's
			needs are actually to occur, making such improvements simple
			is only the first step. In addition, we recommend a few simple
			measures to incentivise developers in this regard.</p>

			<p>The first measure is to set up efficient and painless
			processes for contribution. Not only should contributing to
			the mainline project not require additional effort; doing so
			should ideally be <i>easier</i>	for a developer than applying
			a patch only to the copy of the	software that is being used
			within the Commission.</p>
			
			<p>The second measure is to permit developers to attach their name to
			their contributions, while the copyright remains with the European
			Commission or another EU institution. Contributions to Free Software
			projects are an important and valued component of a developer's
			experience and resume, since they permit future employers to get a
			realistic impression of a potential hire's skills. Permitting
			developers to attach their name to the contributions they make would
			allow them to build up a portfolio of demonstrable work experience
			during their time with the Commission, and would make the Commission
			a more attractive employer.</p>
			
			<p>In practice, the best path would be to allow developers to write the
			copyright notices on their contribution in roughly the following way:</p>
			
			<blockquote><p>This code contributed by Jane Smith
			&lt;jane.smith@ec.europa.eu&gt;. &#169; 2014 European
			Commission.</p></blockquote>
			
			<p>It should be noted that both measures are simple steps
			to take, and require little more than an administrative
			decision. They also do not add costs; on the contrary, they
			may well contribute to reducing costs for maintenance and
			adaptions in the medium term.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div><h3 id="sec-2-5">2.5. Under which licenses should the European
	Commission release contributions to Free Software projects?</h3>
		<div>
			<p>When developers associated with the Commission contribute
			to existing Free Software projects, such contributions will
			as a rule need to be made under the same Free Software license
			as the main project. In fact, most projects would refuse
			contributions under any other license, because mixing different
			licenses in the same project would quickly lead to conflicting
			sets of copyright rules, creating problems that are difficult
			or impossible to resolve.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div><h3 id="sec-2-6">2.6. Contributor agreements</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Some Free Software projects demand that contributors
			assign the copyright in their contributions to an organisation,
			usually either a company or a foundation acting as a fiduciary.
			These agreements have the purpose of making projects with a
			large number of contributors easier to manage on the legal
			level.</p>
			
			<p>If developers, or the organisations where they work, are required to
			sign a contribution agreement in order to contribute to a project, we
			recommend to submit the proposed agreement to a competent lawyer for
			consideration. Most likely, such questions will need to be decided by
			the Director General after having consulted the Commission's Legal
			Service and the relevant department in the Joint Research Centre. A
			repository of approved contribution agreements could be maintained, to
			avoide repeated legal review. The required effort should be weighed
			against the benefit of having the software in question adapted to the
			Commission's needs<sup><a id="fnr.7" name="fnr.7" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

<!-- Distributing software developed by or for the EC -->
	<div><h2 id="sec-3">3 Distributing software developed by or for the EC</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Public administrations are always at liberty to develop software for
			their own purposes, or contract out such work to third parties. Once
			this software has been developed, the public administration may decide
			to make the program available to others as well.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div><h3 id="sec-3-1">3.1. Why should the European Commission release
	its own programs as Free Software?</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Software is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_%2528economics%2529">non-rival</a>
			good: If a citizen or company makes use of a computer program
			paid for by the European Commission, this use does not in any
			way interfere with the Commission's own use of that program<sup><a id="fnr.8" name="fnr.8" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>.
			Quite to the contrary: The program might actually generate
			additional value for the citizen or company which was not
			previously available. According to a study by Carlo Daffara, Free
			Software contributes 450 billion Euro each year to Europe's economy,
			in direct savings and increased productivity and efficiency<sup><a id="fnr.9" name="fnr.9" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup>.</p>

			<p>It is important to understand that the value of any software released
			by the Commission under a Free Software license is in the eye of the
			beholder, i.e. the external user. As with Open Data, external users
			may put these programs to useful purposes that the Commission could
			not predict ahead of time, thus generating added value for Europe's
			economy at no additional cost to the taxpayer<sup><a id="fnr.10" name="fnr.10" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup>.
			Since distributing software is not among the primary responsibilities
			of the European Commission, it is important that this process
			should be designed to be as efficient as possible.</p>

			<p>The European Commission is ultimately funded through the taxes of
			European citizens. It is only logical that wherever possible, the
			assets created with public funds should be made available to the
			public. On its Joinup portal<sup><a id="fnr.11" name="fnr.11" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup>,
			the Commission offers a platform for public administrations
			to make their software available for re-use. Some European
			regions, such as Andalusia and the Basque Country in Spain,
			are requiring all programs developed with public funds to be
			made available as Free Software. These policies follow an
			economic logic of stimulating the development of competent IT
			companies in those regions, and we consider them an example which the
			European Commission might wish to follow.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div><h3 id="sec-3-2">3.2. Current Free Software releases by the
	European Commission</h3>
		<div>
			<p>The European Commission has developed a Free Software license of its
			own explicitely for this purpose: The European Union Public License
			(EUPL)<sup><a id="fnr.12" name="fnr.12" href="#fn.12">12</a></sup>.</p>

			<p>Already now, the The European Commission is making numerous Free
			Software solutions publicly available through the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/">Joinup</a> repository
			and collaborative platform, a project by DG DIGIT's ISA
			Programme. Examples include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Open ePrior (now being implemented by the Belgian Federal and the
				government of the Flemish region)</li>

				<li>Open eTrustEX</li>

				<li>ECI Validation Tool for Statements of Support (VTECI)</li>

				<li>ECI Online Collection Software (OCS)</li>

				<li>SPOCS-Simple Procedures Online for Crossborder Services</li>

				<li>Tarîqa</li>

				<li>Multilingual Electronic Dossier</li>

				<li>Inspire Registry</li>

				<li>Inspire Geoportal</li>

				<li>Inspire validator</li>

				<li>mAggregator</li>

				<li>mDownloader</li>

				<li>ePetition (renamed euSurvey)</li>

				<li>Stork</li>

				<li>Joinup (now reused by the government of Vietnam,
				South Australia and Australia and New Zealand)</li>

				<li>OS toolbox</li>

				<li>Echo Offline eSingle form</li>
			</ul>

			<p>These examples indicate that the EC already has substantial practical
			experience in sharing software. We recommend to systematically review
			the lessons learned, identify potential improvements to the process,
			and implement them.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div><h3 id="sec-3-3">3.3. Making releasing software under a Free Software license easy</h3>
		<div>
			<p>As discussed in relation to contributions to existing projects
			discussed above, the decision procedure within the Commission is the
			same in both cases: the relevant Director General consult the Legal
			Service and the Joint Research Centre and takes a decision.</p>

			<p>When releasing software, we recommend that the Commission should
			follow accepted best practices of the Free Software
			community. Projects should have a modular structure, and should
			ideally be hosted on a public version control platform that makes it
			easy for both in-house and outside developers to contribute to the
			project.</p>

			<p>Before distributing or publishing newly developed software, the
			Commission should carefully check that the finished program complies
			with all license requirements on inbound code (i.e. existing Free
			Software components used in the project). The EC should also select a
			Free Software license under which to distribute the project. In the
			past, the Commission has given preference to the
			<a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/page/eupl">European Union Public
			License</a> (EUPL). Depending on the inbound code being reused, it may be
			necessary to distribute the project under another license, such as the
			<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl">GNU General Public License</a>.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

<!-- Further considerations -->

	<div><h2 id="sec-4">4. Further considerations</h2></div>
	
	<div><h3 id="sec-4-1">4.1. Liability</h3></div>
	
	<div><h4 id="sec-4-1-1">4.1.1. Outbound liability</h4>
		<div>
			<p>The question of liability is sometimes raised in connection with
			oublic bodies releasing Free Software, or to contribute to external
			Free Software projects. While this is a prudent consideration to
			undertake, it does not present an obstacle to such releases or
			contributions in practice.</p>

			<p>This section is based on a legal opinion published by Dr
			Till Jaeger and Dr Carsten Schulz, which in addition to being the
			leading document in this field can be considered to have stood the
			test of time<sup><a id="fnr.13" name="fnr.13" href="#fn.13">13</a></sup>.
			The opinion is based on German liability law, which carries
			perhaps the most stringent liability rules in the EU.</p>

			<p>According to Jaeger and Schulz, software that is distributed free of
			charge has the legal status of a gift. This means that the
			institution providing the software (in this case, the Commission or
			another European institution) will only be liable for defects which
			it has maliciously concealed<sup><a id="fnr.14" name="fnr.14" href="#fn.14">14</a></sup>.</p>

			<p>Should the program turn out to infringe any third-party rights (such
			as copyright, patents or trademarks held by others), the Commission
			would only be liable if it had introduced such infringements knowingly
			and willingly.<sup><a id="fnr.15" name="fnr.15" href="#fn.15">15</a></sup>.</p>


			<p>In addition to these considerations, it is worth pointing out that
			neither the author of this document (despite a decade of personal
			experience in the field) nor any of the experts that have contributed
			to this text are aware of a single successful liability complaint
			brought against a person or institution who has distributed Free
			Software free of charge.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div><h4 id="sec-4-1-2">4.1.2. Inbound liability</h4>
		<div>
			<p>Where the Commission uses Free Software produced externally, the
			developers and distributors of the programs in question normally
			cannot be held liable for any problems or malfunctions. Where the
			Commission deems it necessary to have an external party to hold liable
			for problems, it may enter into a service contract with a suitable
			company.</p>

			<p>It is worth noting that in practice, there is little or no difference
			between Free and non-free software in this regard. The makers of
			non-free programs typically design their end-user license agreements
			to exclude liability to the maximum extent possible under the
			law. This means that even in extreme circumstances, software makers
			can only be held liable for defects which they have maliciously
			concealed.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div><h3 id="sec-4-2">4.2. Remarks on software procurement</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Free Software represents only a part of the software used by the
			Commission. Significant benefits are available from updates to the
			Commission's approach to software procurement.</p>

			<p>IT procurement is a complex and dynamic field. It would therefore be
			prudent for the Commission to stay abreast with the rapid development
			of best practices in the field. A particularly valuable example are
			the "Red Lines for IT procurement" announced by the UK Government in
			January 2014<sup><a id="fnr.16" name="fnr.16" href="#fn.16">16</a></sup>.</p>

			<p>Besides putting an explicit limit on the size of individual contracts,
			these rules state that:</p>
			
			<blockquote><ul>
				<li>companies with a contract for service provision will not be
				allowed to provide system integration in the same part of
				government</li>

				<li>there will be no automatic contract extensions; the government
				won’t extend existing contracts unless there is a compelling
				case</li>

				<li>new hosting contracts will not last for more than 2 years</li>
			</ul></blockquote>
			
			<div>
				<p><img src="./UKGsuppliers2010.png" alt="UKGsuppliers2010.png" /></p>
				<p>Figure 1: Geographical distribution of the UK Government's IT supply chain, 2010</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>Pointing out that "[s]marter purchasing realised savings of £3.8
			billion in 2012 to 2013 alone", the government's chief procurement
			officer said that these steps were intended to counter monopolistic or
			oligopolistic behaviour among suppliers<sup><a id="fnr.17" name="fnr.17" href="#fn.17">17</a></sup>
			of precisely the sort that have lead the Commission into its
			current "effective captivity" to Microsoft in particular.</p>

			<p>When procuring new solutions, the Commission should consider future
			exit costs during the process of assessing new solutions, along the
			lines of the UK Government's Technology Code of Practice:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>"Ensure a level-playing field for open source software. Demonstrate
				an active and fair consideration of using open source software –
				taking account of the total lifetime cost of ownership of the
				solution, including exit and transition costs."<sup><a id="fnr.18" name="fnr.18" href="#fn.18">18</a></sup></p>
			</blockquote>
			
			<div>
				<p><img src="./UKGsuppliers2014.png" alt="UKGsuppliers2014.png" /></p>
				<p>Figure 2: Geographical distribution of the UK Government's IT supply chain, 2014</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>In addition, the UK Government's Open Standards principles deal with
			the issue of exit costs:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>"As part of examining the total cost of ownership of a
				government IT solution, the costs of exit for a component should be
				estimated at the start of implementation. As unlocking costs are
				identified, these must be associated with the incumbent
				supplier/system and not be associated with cost of new IT projects."<sup><a id="fnr.19" name="fnr.19" href="#fn.19">19</a></sup></p>
			</blockquote>
			
			<p>Taken together, the UK Government's Open Standards policy and the
			changes made to IT procurement have already resulted in a significant
			diversification of the government's IT supply chain, as indicated by
			the changed geographical distribution of the government's IT
			suppliers (see Figures 1 and 2).</p>


			<p>Concerning framework agreements, Sweden's central procurement agency
			Kammarkollegiet offers a useful example. The agency has recently
			published a set of framework agreements for software and
			services. Each agreement covers Free Software, non-free software, and
			cloud services at the same level, making it possible to directly
			compare value for money for each particular use case.</p>

<!-- Conclusions -->

	<div><h2 id="sec-5">5. Conclusions</h2>
		<div>
			<p>The European Commission stands to gain significant advantages from
			allowing its developers and contractors to contribute to outside Free
			Software projects. By distributing its own programs as Free Software,
			the Commission can enable the interoperability gains and efficiency
			savings that come with reuse. Such releases also make valuable assets
			available to the taxpayers who paid for them, enabling further
			economic exploitation. Provided that appropriate policies and
			processes are put in place, neither contributions to outside projects
			nor the release of programs as Free Software carries any significant
			risks or downsides for the Commission.</p>
			
			<p>Main considerations related to contributing to external
			Free Software projects:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Allowing the EC's developers and contractors to contribute to
				upstream projects currently in use at the Commission is an
				effective way of ensuring that these programs fill suit the
				Commission's needs in future. Such contributions will not, as a
				rule, put the Commission in competition with commercial actors.</li>

				<li>The first step in enabling developers and contractors to contribute
				to upstream projects is to clarify who holds copyright in their
				contributions, and therefore is in a position to decide on the
				license conditions under which the contribution shall be distributed.</li>

				<li>To actually enable contributions to outside upstream projects, the
				EC should publish a statement clarifying that such contributions by
				Commission staff and contractors are permitted and desired.</li>

				<li>As a next step, the Commission should create a simple policy for
				more substantial contributions and other cases where explicit
				approval is required. This policy should state a clear approval
				path for contribution requests, along with the maximum time that
				the requesting developer will have to wait for an answer.</li>

				<li>Besides making the process of contributing to outside projects as
				simple as possible, the Commission can incentivise its developers
				to engage in such contributions by allowing them to include their
				name in the copyright notice (while copyright remains with the EC).</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Main considerations related to the EC releasing programs developed by
			the EC as Free Software:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Software created by or for the European Commission is ultimately
				funded by European taxpayers. The Commission should make such
				software available for reuse by default; Free Software licenses
				provide an efficient mechanism for this.</li>

				<li>Already now, the EC distributes numerous programs under Free
				Software licenses, and has gained significant experience in this
				regard.</li>

				<li>When distributing its own programs as Free Software, the Commission
				is free to choosing a license which it considers suitable. If
				pre-existing Free Software components were used in the project, the
				EC's choice of license will have to fulfil the license requirements
				of those inbound components.</li>

				<li>The EC would only be liable for defects in programs it distributes
				if it has maliciously concealed those defects. In practice, it is
				extremely unlikely that such programs will present a source of
				liability claims against the Commission.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>In addition to these considerations, we recommend that the EC should
			review its approach to software procurement to take into account best
			practices that were recently developed, such as the standards and
			procurement policies issued by the UK government in 2013-14.</p>
