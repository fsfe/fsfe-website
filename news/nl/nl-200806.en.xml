      Housekeeping items are the least popular of all tasks in any
      organisation, and any organisation that is working under pressure has
      a tendency of accumulating them. 
      That is why after the intensive work of the past year to build up and
      grow the Freedom Task Force, work on antitrust and OOXML issues, and
      various other activities, FSFE had some of them as well.
      Fortunately, after substantial preparation and three intensive days,
      FSFE's General Assembly in June managed to take care of them and send
      everyone home highly motivated and with a full task list. The results
      of this will become slowly visible throughout the coming year.
