    <title>Berlin Fellowship Meeting with a talk about different licenses, used for Free Software</title>
   <body>
    On Thursday, October 9, there will be the next Berlin Fellowship meeting, as usual in the e-lok (near Ostkreuz). This time, Tomás will give a talk about different licenses used for Free Software: What kind of licenses exist, in what points do they differ from each other? As usual, the Fellowship meeting is a good possibility to meet other Fellows as well as other Free Software enthusiasts. You can get good food and best drinks at e-lok for a reasonable price and good mood for no cost. Official start is at 19:30.
