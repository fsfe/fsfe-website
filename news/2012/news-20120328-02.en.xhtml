    <h1>Document Freedom Day 2012: Activists around the world celebrate Open Standards</h1>

	<p newsteaser="yes">Free Software advocates worldwide are today celebrating information accessibility and Open Standards. 48 events in 17 countries are using demonatrations, talks, and workshops to explain why Open Standards and Free Software are crucial to a free and competitive information society.</p>

	<p>A network of 34 international partner organisations are carrying this message to new audiences, from Cairo to Argentina, Poland to Taiwan, and the European Parliament to Aberystwyth University.</p>

	<p>"The growth of support for Document Freedom Day shows growing demand for accessible formats and unpredjudiced standards" says Campapaign Coordinator Matthias Kirschner". "Citizens, businesses, and politicians alike are calling for adoption of fairer and more compatible international standards". Prizes are being awarded this year by Document Freedom Day teams in Germany, Italy, Slovakia, and Poland, to businesses and government offices which have recently adopted Open Standards within their organisations.</p>

	<p>Open Standards are a common language, publicly documented, that computer programs can speak. They are central to interoperability and freedom of choice in technology. Open Standards allow Free Software developers to create programs that can interoperate with other solutions, so users can migrate away from proprietary solutions.</p>

	<p>"Fresh support from celebrities like Stephen Fry, and major community groups such as Open Rights Group have introduced Open Standards to new groups this year" said Deputy Campaign Coordinator, Sam Tuke. "We are delighted by the response we have received, and the additional political impact Document Freedom Day has achieved".</p>

	<p>Document Freedom Day 2011 is facilitated by the Free Software Foundation Europe, and supported by campaign patrons Google and Oracle.</p>
