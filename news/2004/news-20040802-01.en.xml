      "Software patents will destroy the foundations of IBM's future":<br />

      "Everyone should understand well enough by now that an arms race is
      hardly ever productive. It leads to unsustainable growth of ballast
      beyond any useful proportions until all but one participant in that race
      have lost. You may think that IBM would be the one surviving that arms
      race, and you may be right.<br />

      However as a result of participation in that arms race, IBM is slowly
      being deformed. It spends more and more energy on an arms race that is
      increasingly being questioned."
