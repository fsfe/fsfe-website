		<h1>EC hits Microsoft with EUR 561 million fine over web browsers</h1>
		
		<p newsteaser="yes">Last week, the European Commission slapped the company with a fine of more than 500 million EUR for breaching a settlement over the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows. Karsten Gerloff, the president of the FSFE, <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/gerloff/2013/03/06/ec-hits-microsoft-with-eur-561-million-fine-over-web-browsers/">is explaining position of the Free Software Foundation Europe</a>.</p>

		<p>Today, the European Commission slapped the company with a fine of EUR 561 million (ca. USD 731 million) for breaching a 2009 settlement over the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows. Under this agreement, Microsoft promised to display a “browser choice” screen on Windows installs in Europe, inviting users to choose other browsers besides the company’s own program.</p>

		<p>At FSFE we were <a href="http://fsfe.org/news/2010/news-20100222-01.en.html">cautiously optimistic</a> at the time. We were glad that the European Commission had taken on this issue at all, but we also pointed out that regulators would have to keep a close watch to make sure the browser choice screen was having the intended effect:</p>
