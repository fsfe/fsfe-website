    <title>FSFE to challenge Microsoft in its appeal against European Commission</title>
    <body>
The European Commission sought to help the IT market grow in the best
possible way for consumers and citizens of the European Union with its
antitrust ruling against Microsoft.
Although it seems questionable whether that ruling would truly stop
the monopoly, Microsoft seems to be worried and has entered appeal
against it in front of the European Court.
After having participated as third party in the <a href="/projects/ms-vs-eu/">antitrust case before</a>,
the Free Software Foundation Europe has participated to the
preliminary hearing on Tuesday 27th of July 2004 to enter court in
order to defend the decision of the European Commission and the
freedom to use Free Software SAMBA.
