      FSFE's activities have been varied over the last month.  It's promising to see
      the increase of Fellowship activities across Europe. We are looking forward to
      seeing more local groups appear and to hearing about their activities on all
      levels.  One of the most important parts of supporting Free Software is sharing
      knowledge in your own community.
