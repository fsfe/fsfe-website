  <p>
    Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to control
    technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives and it
    is important that technology empowers rather than restricts us. Free
    Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt, and share
    software. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom
    of speech, press, and privacy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free Software
    contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination. It enhances
    users' rights by abolishing barriers to Free Software adoption, encourages
    people to use and develop Free Software, and provides resources to enable
    everyone to further promote Free Software in Europe.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are involved in <a href="/activities/">many activities</a> in the legal,
    economic, political and technical areas around Free Software. Our work is
    made possible by a community of volunteers, supporters, donors, and staff.
