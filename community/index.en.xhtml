    <h2 id="about">About FSFE's Community</h2>
    
    
    
    <p>The community behind the Free Software Foundation Europe is diverse and spread throughout the continent. We see ourselves as Europeans with a different cultural background but with the common vision of an infrastructure built on Free Software - as a precondition of a Free Society. This is what makes us strong. We believe in cooperation from a regional to a global level, from community to an organisational level, from freedom to liberty. Interested? You are welcome to join our community! Read about the different ways, how to become part of our movement:</p>

Or, if you like what we do - wherever you live, wherever you go - <a href="../contribute/spreadtheword.en.html">help to spread our word</a>. Viral marketing and spreading the word are important factors to let our movement grow.</p>

    <h3>Show up at a local meeting</h3>
    
      <p>More and more local FSFE groups come into existence throughout Europe. If you like to meet likeminded people with an clear view about the interconnection between Free Software and Free Society, attend a meeting. Or set up your own, if there is no one in your area yet.</p>
    
    <h3>Contribute something</h3>
    
      <p>Many of the things FSFE does and is able to do, relies on the priceless help of volunteers throughout Europe.

      <p>For example, translations are really important for our cross-border communication and outreaching activities. And you do not need to be an interpreter for the translations - if you are a mother tongue speaker and you have a feeling for proper language, this is a good start.</p>
