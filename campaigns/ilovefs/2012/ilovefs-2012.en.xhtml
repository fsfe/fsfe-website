<p id="introduction">Valentine's Day traditionally is a day to show and celebrate your love to whom you like to dedicate it to. But instead of solely showing your love to your beloved one, we think Valentine's Day can be a great opportunity to declare your love and show your gratitude to the people behind any and every <a href="/about/basics/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> initiative or organisation, too. This will not only delight the people behind your preferred Free Software - beyond that, you can support us in celebrating and establishing Valentines Day as an "I love Free Software"-Day. <br/>
Last years Valentine's Day was a big success for the "I love Free Software"-Day, thank you all for your support. If you like to know more about last years campaign, please have a look at the <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/maelle/?p=228">report of Valentine's Day 2011</a>.

<p>This years Valentine's Day, Tuesday 14th of February 2012, the FSFE is planning an online campaign and an offline event as well. Both will be dedicated to "I love Free Software". </p>

<h2>Spread your love for Free Software: go public Online Campaigning</h2> 
<p>Behind every Free Software initiative and organisation are real, passionate
hard-working people. Show them that you appreciate their work – it could make
all the difference!</p>
<p>In fact, there are lots of ways to declare one's love... Here are some ideas on how you can go public and proclaim your love to Free Software.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Send active Free Software supporters a message thanking them for their work. Do not underestimate the effects of such a message. As many Free Software developers work hard for their projects without earning money, a nice "thank you" is a good currency for further encouragement </li>
  <li>Especially on Valentine's Day, microblog about how you love Free Software, and use the Hashtag <!-- [dont't translate the comment] link either to http://identi.ca/ilovefs or to the agregation of dents underneath--> <strong><a href="http://identi.ca/ilovefs">#ilovefs</a></strong>. </li> Encourage your friends to do as well, to reach a high ranking on Twitter trends and hashtag timelines in identi.ca and every other social blogging system.
  <li>If you are a Blogger, blog about the "I love Free Software"-Day and the idea behind it. Get people attracted by the idea of Free Software. Look for our Banners at the bottom of this page.</li>
  <li>If you are living in Germany, promote our Offline-Event in the Unperfekt-Haus in Essen</li>
</ul>

<h2>Offline-Event: I love Free Software</h2>

<p>This year for the first time, there will be an #iovefs-Offline-Event, too. This event will take place at the <a href="http://www.unperfekthaus.de/">Unperfekthaus</a> in Essen. We would like this event to bring together Free Software users, activists, developers and everyone else who is in favor of Free Software.<br/>
The Unperfekthaus in Essen seems best location to celebrate Free Software, as it is a building to host free minds at nearly no cost, to colaborate and elaborate their ideas and thougts - similar to many Free Software projects.
We are still in progress of setting up our schedule, but here is a general explanation about how the day will be:

<strong>When?</strong> 14/02/2012 - We will be situated the whole day in the Unperfekthaus 
<strong>How Much?</strong> Everybody who wants to join our event has to pay normal fee for the Unperfekthaus, but is allowed - of course - to leave our event and to visit the whole Unperfekthaus like usual paying includes. (Visit the homepage to learn more about the house and its possibilities hier)
<strong>What to expect?</strong> Over the day we will offer some workshops and introductions to Free Software and its aspects. This will give a chance for newcomers to get to know what we are talking about when we say "Free as in Free Software". But there will be some discussions and informations for oldies too, about ongoing projects, unperfekt ideas and so on. <br/>
We tried to set everything this way up, that you can bring your family, too. There will be amusement for the kids as well as amusments for loving partnerships. <br/>
You like to contribute something? We will set up a speakers corner for everyone to do brief speeches, you can set up spontaneous workshops or discussion groups, feel free to present you own Free Software product or the one you love the most ... In the end and over all, there is the goal to celebrate together and have some fun, to get to know each other and to learn from each other ....<br/>
In the evening some bands will be playing live-music. These bands will be announced in next days.</p>

<p>schedule up to now:<br/>
<ul>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>
please check this page regularly for updates on what will happening during the I love Free Software Day meeting.</p> 





<h2><span><a name="testimonials">Why they love Free Software</a></span></h2>
<div class="testimonial">
<img src="/about/oberg/avatar.jpg"/>
<p>"On Valentines Day, the Society for Free Culture and Software, extends their
love to projects such as Audacity, GIMP, Inkscape and other audiovisual tools.
These tools form the backbone of the infrastructure needed to support free
culture and while Free Culture could technically exist independently of Free
Software, the two movements share a common philosophy of freedom which make the
two inseparable.  Without Free Software, our activities would be so much more
difficult to carry out, and no Free Culture project would be able to enjoy the
full freedoms without the infrastructure created by Free Software projects such
as those outlined before. To everyone engaged in supporting this
infrastructure: thank you! We love you!"<br/>

<img src="/campaigns/valentine/2011/Cornelius-Schumacher.jpg"/>
<p>Free Software is central to everything KDE does and without Free Software KDE  
software could not exist.<br/>

KDE relies overwhelmingly on volunteer contributions from people all around 
the world who, initially, do not know one another. Free Software provides the 
social contract that makes such contributions possible, as our volunteers know 
they are helping to create a common good that can be shared by all.<br/>

Free Software and the shared purpose it creates also gives KDE its distinctive  
non-hierarchical meritocratic structure. Without the principles of Free 
Software, KDE would need centralised control of the software copyrights and, 
in turn, a set of leaders determining the direction of the software we 
produce. Our contributors would have less ability to try out new ideas, to 
work on the things that really matter to them and, above all, to be Free.<br/>

Without Free Software, there would be no KDE. Free Software gives KDE life. 
KDE loves Free Software.<br/>

<p>"A few decades ago the word "Freedom" had a very different meaning than
today. We live in a digital society in which many aspects of our lives,
and of our Freedom, go through a digital medium. Having full control of
the software we use is therefore the only way to achieve full control of
our Freedom. I love Free Software because I take care of my Freedom."<br/>
