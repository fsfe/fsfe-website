        <title>REUSE: Displaying copyright and licence information easily! at Akademy-es in Barcelona, Spain</title>

    <body>
      <p>Developing, using, and re-using Free Software is fun, but dealing with licensing and copyright information is not. REUSE changes that. With three simple steps, it makes adding and reading licensing and copyright information easy for both humans and machines. In this presentation, Lina Ceballos will guide us through the principles of REUSE and show us how to make licensing clear and simple. </p>
      <p>Akademy-es which will take place in a hybrid format, you can check the talk online as well. Lina will hold the talk in Spanish and in person in Barcelona. It will take place on Friday 30th September from 15:30 to 16:15. You can register your participation out of cost here: https://www.kde-espana.org/akademy-es2022/registro.php</p>
