      The so-called "Braderie de Lille" (Lille's flea market) is a big outside-event which has taken place every year since the 12th century during the first week-end of september. <a href="http://www.chtinux.org/" target="_blank">chtinux</a>, a Linux User Group which is installed around there, has proposed to the Fellowship to take part in the Braderie. The FSFE, and especially the Fellowship's stand, will get much visibility, since millions of people of numerous nations take a walk on Lille's streets. Come to discover this beautiful city and to eat some Braderie's culinary specialities like clams ! And above all,  come in order to support the Fellowship !
Fellowship's stand will be situated on Place du Vieux Marché aux chevaux.
