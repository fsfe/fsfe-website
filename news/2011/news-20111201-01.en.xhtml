<head><title>FSFE provides input to EC on 80bn EUR R and D funding program</title></head>
<body>
<p>
FSFE has sent input to the European Commission on its upcoming
seven-year flagship program for research funding. Under the "Horizon
2020" program, the European Commission will support research and
development in Europe with 80 billion Euro from 2014 to 2020.
</p>
<p>
The goal of <a href="/campaigns/horizon2020/">FSFE's
contribution</a> is to help the EC maximise the social value Europeans
obtain from the Horizon 2020 program, which is funded out of the taxes
they have paid.
</p>
<p>
Key points of FSFE's input: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distributed systems and cryptography are key areas which should
   receive R and D funding. They will be essential to preserving users'
   freedoms in a world of networked services.</li>

  <li> Results obtained from publicly funded research should be
   accessible to the public, and should be available for re-use.</li>

 <li>Administrative hurdles to obtaining funding under Horizon 2020
   should be lowered, in order to make access easier for small
   companies, organisations, and individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>
FSFE will continue to engage with the European institutions in order
to support the development
of <a href="/campaigns/horizon2020/">Horizon 2020</a>.
