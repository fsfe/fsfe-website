    <title>Web Friday @ FSFE</title>
    <body>
      <p>Want to do something for Free Software? Know some HTML
  and CSS? Then you can help us make FSFE's website better!</p>

      <p>Join us for our regular Web Friday today from 15:00 UTC+1. We'll
meet on Jabber (conference@jabber.fsfe.org, channel: fellowship)
and on IRC (#fsfe on freenode). From 15:00 to 15:30, FSFE's
webmasters will explain how the build system for FSFE's website
works, and get you all set up.</p>

      <p>Afterwards, it's "pick a bug and squash it"! Drop in, enjoy
  great company, and meet people who are as passionate about Free
  Software as you are.</p>

      <p>Whether today or at any other time, you're always welcome to
  contribute to the web team's work. <a
  href="http://fsfe.org/contribute/web/">Read here</a> to find out
  how stuff works. We're looking forward to seeing you around!</p>
