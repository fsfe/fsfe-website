    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
      	Our involvement in the European Union policy goes back to 2001,
      	when FSFE became an interested third-party in the Commission's
      	antitrust case against Microsoft. Since then, we have kept
      	on promoting Free Software by focusing on fundamental principles,
      	such as fair competition, being respected.

    <h2>EU Policies overview: Free Software and Open Standards</h2>
    <p>
    	Many countries in Europe have policies, laws or
	recommendations concerning Free Software and Open
	Standards. In collaboration with the Free Software
	community, we are preparing a comprehensive overview of
	these policies. We want to provide both activists and
	policy makers with a tool to compare the approaches that
	exist in different countries, and to learn from both good
	and less good practices. This is a work in progress.
	Please email anything you can add to &lt;policies AT
	fsfeurope DOT org&gt;, along with any comments you may have.<br/>

    <h2>EU Browser case</h2>
      <p>
        Free Software Foundation Europe supported the European Commission's
        antitrust investigation against Microsoft as an interested third party.
        The investigation began on the 16th of January when the European
        Commission DG Competition reported that it had issued a statement of
        objections regarding Microsoft's abuse of web standards and the tying of
        Internet Explorer (IE) to the Windows Operating System product family.
        It is based on a complaint submitted by Opera, a European company
        involved in web browser development, which FSFE publicly supported in
        2007.
      </p>
   
    <h2>European Interoperability</h2>
    
    <p>
      The European Commission is investigating the way Microsoft prevents
      competitors from interfacing with many of its desktop productivity
      programs. FSFE's President Karsten Gerloff says: "We welcome the
      Commission's decision to keep the interoperability investigation open
      while it monitors whether Microsoft's promises help to promote
      competition."
    </p>
    
    <p>
      FSFE is also pushing for <a href="/activities/os/">Open Standards</a>, which
      are key to interoperability and as such FSFE promotes their adoption, especially through the <a href="/news/2009/news-20091127-01.en.html">revision of the European Interoperability Framework</a>.
