      It has been an exceptional month.  The European Commission has fined
      Microsoft an additional 899 million Euro for continuing to restrict
      access to interoperability information prior to October 2007 and the
      ISO Ballot Resolution Meeting in Geneva failed to address most of the
      serious issues and ultimately ended up waving through the bulk of ECMA
      responses without review.  Public awareness of issues relating to
      software freedom have been raised dramatically.
