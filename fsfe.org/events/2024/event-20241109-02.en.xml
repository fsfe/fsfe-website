      <p>“Knitting Our Internet” (KOI) is a workshop that explores the history of the Internet, and offers a perspective for a collective re-imagination of participatory, decentralized networks. The workshop aims at questioning the very essence of today’s social media, exposing the critical limits posed by centralization, monopoly, and surveillance capitalism.<br />
During the activity, Tommaso Marmo will be using a yarn his grandmother gifted him to simulate centralized and decentralized networks, employing concrete metaphors to actively involve the participants. Every individual attending the workshop will be given a quote or an image relevant in the early and contemporary history of the Internet, and they will be asked to share it as the story unfolds.</p>
