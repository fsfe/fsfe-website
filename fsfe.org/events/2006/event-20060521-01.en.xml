      <p>
      At the first international conference on Access to Knowledge, held at
      Yale Law School, Karsten Gerloff will moderate a panel discussion on
      "Licensing Frameworks for Access to Knowledge".  The goal of the
      conference is to come up with a new analytic framework for analysing the
      possibly distortive effects of public policies relying exclusively on
      copyright and patents.  Participants will be looking for alternative ways
      to foster greater access to knowledge in the digitally connected
      environment.
