    <body>
      The UK government has called for public comment  on certain copyright and
      patent issues, some of which are of great importance to the free software
      community, such as DRM and software patents.
      The deadline for submittings answers is April 21; since all answers will
      be posted on a web site, we invite the free software community to voice
      its opinion about these issues.
