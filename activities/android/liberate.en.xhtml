          <p>
              You have an Android phone and its manufacturer does not offer you any recent updates? You are faced with
              the dilemma of either buying a new phone or keeping an outdated device running? Learn on this page
              <strong>how you can install and use a Free Software operating system on your phone</strong> that keeps
              your device up to date.
          </p>

          <p>
              Installing a Free Software operating system means you often have more control over how long to use your
              device. In addition, it comes with a lot of other benefits. <strong>Free Software gives you full control
              over your device</strong>, you can finally de-install apps you could not before, and you profit from
              extended privacy protection - just to mention a few.
          </p>
      </div>
        <p>
            You can choose among several Android-based Free Software operating systems' (also called custom ROMs) or even install a complete
            GNU/Linux environment. Different operating systems come with different focuses. Some focus on giving users
            as much freedom as possible, others on privacy, on usability, and more. You can choose for yourself
            which operating system best suits your needs. Enjoy the feeling of a new operating system; it's just like
            having a new device.
        </p>
        <p>
        To have a liberated device you need both <a href="#OS">the 
        OS</a> and <a href="#Apps">the Apps</a> to be free. To achieve 
        this you can either:
    </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Liberate your current phone by installing a free OS (<a href="#OS">OS options below</a>)
	</li>
    <li>
    Purchase a new phone that can be liberated (list of compatible phones for each OS below)
    </li>
	<li>
	Purchase a phone that already ships with Free Software <a

		  <p>
                  For beginners, the easiest way is to start with liberating
                  your phone from proprietary apps. There are dedicated Free
                  Software app stores that offer free apps for the most
                  common use cases, for example messaging, navigation,
                  or games.

          <h3><a href="#OS">Operating Systems</a></h3>
		  <p>
		  Most operating systems on phones you can buy are not free. They contain
      pre-installed proprietary software which limit your freedoms and harm your
      privacy. Advanced users should therefore install a mobile operating system
      that is as free as possible.

        A few devices are already shipped with Free Software by default,
        so you don't need to liberate them. This is the easiest option for non-technical users.

      <h2 id="Apps">The Apps</h2>
      <p>
        For most people, the <a href="https://play.google.com/">Google
        Play Store</a> is the only or the main source for their
        applications. It doesn't even tell you whether an app is Free Software
        or not, let alone its license. Unfortunately, most apps from this or
        other markets are proprietary. Even if you install a Free Software app,
        there is no reason to trust the downloaded binary. Using Google
        Play also requires a Google account, which is itself proprietary software.
        We recommend to not use this market at all.
      </p>

      <h3 id="F-Droid">F-Droid</h3>
      <div class="image left">

      </div>
    <p>
        Even if you are still using your stock Android: <strong>Installing Free
        Software apps is possible on any type of Android phone.</strong> You can simply
        install <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> and immediately enjoy the biggest Free Software app
        store in the Android world! Browsers, maps, games, music, chats and
        more, everything in one place! Every app you replace with Free
        Software reduces your dependencies on non-free software.
    </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="http://f-droid.org/">F-Droid initiative</a> was started to
        change the sad Free Software app situation in the Android world. It
        builds a repository of easily-installable Free Software apps for the Android
        platform. There is an Android client application that makes it easy to
        browse Free Software applications, install them onto your device, and
        keep track of updates. Apps available on F-Droid do not contain hidden 
        costs and are transparent about possible 
        <a href="https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/AntiFeatures">antifeatures</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The F-Droid repository contains details of multiple versions of each
        application. You can also easily create and add your own repositories. But
        since the initiative is <a
        href="https://gitlab.com/fdroid/">very active</a>,
        developing in a decentralised fashion and open to collaboration,
        creating one's own repositories is not really necessary. Its goal is to
        include all useful Free Software Android applications and to keep up
        with their updates.

    <h3 id="selection">Selected apps for common use cases</h3>
    
    <p>
      Nowadays, we fortunately live in a world in which we can choose from
      various Free Software apps for almost any use case. This section aims
      to present a small selection of apps which are fitting for
      starters. By no means can such a list be ever perfect for every individual
      case. We also recommend you to look at the complete <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/">F-Droid repository</a> or app
      recommendations by <a href="https://prism-break.org/">PRISM Break</a>, <a
      href="https://myshadow.org/">Me and My Shadow</a>, or <a
      href="https://securityinabox.org/">Security in a Box</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="browser">Web browsing</h4>
    
    <p>
      In F-Droid you can find many web browsers for different
      audiences. Probably the most well known is Mozilla's <a
      href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/mobile/">Firefox Mobile</a> which is
      available in a completely Free Software edition as <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/">Fennec</a>.
      Another alternative is Firefox's GNU rebranding <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gnu.icecat/">IceCatMobile</a>. Users who
      prefer lightweight and privacy-aware apps may also want to try <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.klar/">Firefox Klar</a> (also
      known as Firefox Focus).
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="email">Email</h4>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fsck.k9/">K-9 Mail</a> 
      enables its users to add multiple email accounts and offers a 
      wide range of options. It also supports integration with 
      encryption apps like <a 
      href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.keychain/">OpenKeychain</a> 
      and is able to read GnuPG encrypted messages.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="im">Instant Messaging</h4>
    
    <p>
      The situation of Free Software apps for instant messaging is
      complicated. While there are 100% Free Software solutions like <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations/">Conversations</a> and Zom
      (for XMPP/Jabber, iOS users can use <a href="https://chatsecure.org/">ChatSecure</a>), <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.b44t.messenger/">Delta Chat</a> (using
      email) or <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>
      (using Matrix), they probably will not be very widespread among your friends
      because their user bases are relatively small. Other apps are completely or
      mostly Free Software but have other antifeatures like dependencies on non-free
      servers and libraries, or no server federation, for example <a
      href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> or <a
      href="https://wire.com/">Wire</a>. There are several initiatives to make instant
      messaging as free, secure, decentralised, and user-friendly as possible, and we
      hope to be able to make clearer recommendations in the future.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="multimedia">Multimedia</h4>
    
    <p>
      Plenty of Free Software apps aim to make you enjoy audio and video
      on your mobile phone. Notable apps are <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/">NewPipe</a>
      as a lightweight interface for YouTube which adds some unique
      features, the <a
      href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html">VLC
      Player</a> for videos, or <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.programmierecke.radiodroid2/">RadioDroid</a>
      to listen to thousands of radio stations. Podcast listeners may
      like <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/de.danoeh.antennapod/">AntennaPod</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="outdoors">Outdoors</h4>
    
    <p>
      When you are travelling, your mobile phone can be a helper for
      you. <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/de.grobox.liberario/">Transportr</a>
      knows public transportation networks of countries and cities all
      over the world. <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/">OsmAnd</a>
      serves detailed offline and online maps of whereever you are
      right now, and also includes navigation when riding your bicycle
      or car.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="games">Games</h4>
    
    <p>
      F-Droid contains various mobile games for almost any taste. For
      example puzzlers may enjoy <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.uberspot.a2048/">2048</a>
      while block sandbox fans can play <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.minetest.minetest/">Minetest</a>
      in single as well as multiplayer mode. For fans of 1010! there is 
      <a 
      href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/io.github.lonamiwebs.klooni/">1010! 
      Klooni</a>.
    </p>
    

  <h2 id="OS">The Operating Systems</h2>
      
      <p> 
        An operating system is a collection of software that enables you to use
        your phone and run other applications on it. Even though Android is <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html">partially
        free</a>, many phones ship with proprietary components and add-ons. Some
        phones also have a locked boot loader
        which prevents you from booting and installing other operating systems.
        If you want to buy an Android phone, make sure that the boot loader can
        be unlocked.</p>

      <p>On some devices, it can only be unlocked with clever hacks and their
      manufacturers tend to declare your warranty void when you unlock 
      their device's boot loader. But, given European Directive 
      1999/44/CE, just the fact that you modified or changed the 
      software of your device is not a sufficient reason to void your 
      statutory warranty. <a 
      href="/freesoftware/legal/flashingdevices.html" title="Does 
      rooting your phone invalidate its warranty?">See Carlo Piana's and 
      Matija Šuklje's analysis</a> for more information.
      </p>

      <p>There are
        also companies that ship their devices with an unlocked bootloader or
        provide you with the means to unlock it. These phones should be 
        preferred for easy installs and usability. 
      </p>

    <p>
        You can install a Free Software operating system on your device yourself. This process is also called flashing.
        Keep in mind that this might be not an
        easy task when you do it for the first time. It needs some preparation and research in advance. There is however
        plenty of information and help available from diverse communities, on the Internet and locally. And if you like
        tinkering around with technology, you can have fun installing Free Software on your phone pretty soon.

        Android device comes with, freedom is not its main objective,
        running on as many devices as possible is.
        You do not need a Google account to use LineageOS, neither does 
        it contain Google Play services. LineageOS works pretty well

      <h3 id="beyondandroid">Beyond Android</h3>
      <p>
          Despite currently being the world's most used operating system on mobile phones, <strong>Android is by far not
          the only Free Software mobile operating system you can use</strong>. If you are curious, there is a lot more
          to discover. This means you do not need to install any Android based custom-ROM to liberate. Instead,
          <strong>you can install complete GNU/Linux systems or other Linux-based environments on your phone</strong>
          (if supported).
      </p>
      <p>
          GNU/Linux operating systems usually put freedom first, and their development is totally separate from the
          Google-dominated Android ecosystem. Even better, the code development does not rely on any other single
          company either: GNU/Linux systems are developed transparently by large communities around the globe with no
          single entity that is in control. Code changes can be proposed by any volunteer around the world, and any
          accepted change is directly visible to everyone. Many developers put efforts into offering backward
          compatibility of changes and using GNU/Linux you will benefit from many years of support for the operating
          system on your device.
      </p>

      <p>
          Choosing a GNU/Linux system for your phone means that some available apps will be different from what you're
          used to. This might be subject to change in the future though, as more and more Linux based operating systems
          enter the market. Also you can use <a href="https://waydro.id/">third-party software to bridge</a> between
          native Android apps and GNU/Linux systems or the other way around. However, the more Android apps you decide to
          bridge and use in your free GNU/Linux operating system, the more you start suffering again from restrictions
          in the Android world. Sticking to native GNU/Linux apps on your system usually means benefiting from using
          Free Software and Open Standards. And as more GNU/Linux systems become available on mobile phones, their
          markets and developments are expected to grow further.

      <h3 id="linuxphones">GNU/Linux Phones</h3>
      <p>
      If you enjoy diversity and experimenting with technology, many more
      options are available to you. GNU/Linux phones may one day become a
      third option alongside iOS and Android. However, today they are still
      under heavy development so are still considered to be in beta, so they
      might not be the most suitable option for standard users yet. For those
      who like to be at the edge of the curve, we currently have the <a

      the <a 
      href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">Pine 64 
      Pinephone</a>.
      Librem 5 currently ships with PureOS and the Pinephone ships with 
      Manjaro, even though multiple other distributions are supported.
      The PinePhone wiki, for example,
      <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PinePhone_Software_Releases">currently
      lists 21 different Free Software operating systems available</a>
      running on the PinePhone. And a growing number of companies offer
      pre-installed GNU/Linux systems on selected phones, including a
      precisely tailored app environment.
      </p>
      <p>
      On a Linux phone you can install many Linux distributions and the 
      same software you can install on any Linux PC.
