    <h1>Microsoft case: FSFE in European Court of Justice hearing</h1>

<p>
  Fresh action in the European Commission's <a href="/activities/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.html">antitrust
  proceedings against Microsoft</a>: On May 24, the European Court of
  Justice conducts a hearing on Microsoft's appeal against the
  fine. FSFE has <a href="/activities/ms-vs-eu/timeline.html">participated
  in the case</a> for a decade and will intervene on the Commission's
  behalf.
</p>

<p>
  Together with the Samba team, FSFE's legal counsel Carlo Piana and
  President Karsten Gerloff will defend the freedom to
  interoperate. They will reiterate FSFE's view that protocols and
  interoperability information have no intrinsic value, but Microsoft
  kept them secret so it could squelch rivals in the work group server
  market.
</p>

<p>
  In February 2008, the European Court of Justice slapped the software
  giant with a record EUR 899 million fine in 2008.
