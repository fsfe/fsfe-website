        <title>"Digital Sovereignty in Europe - Free Software as the Key" - Lecture and discussion (online)</title>
    <body>

<p>For some years now, the term 'digital sovereignty' has been on everyone's lips and has become very elastic. In this discussion, Max Mehl, FSFE's programme manager, looks back at the origins: software, and how states and their citizens can use it in a self-determined way - because there is still a lot wrong with it. Max Mehl provides an overview of the most important contexts and discusses pragmatic possibilities based on existing examples to put public digital infrastructure on a modern footing.</p>
      <p>The lecture will take place at 19:30 (CEST) at the invitation of Europe Direct Dortmund and can be attended online. No registration is required.</p>
