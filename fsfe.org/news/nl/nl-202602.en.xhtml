<h1>From FOSDEM to "I ❤️ Free Software Day”: community, policy, and the
freedom to study code</h1>

<p>February is a reminder of why our Free Software community matters 
and why it's such a joy to be part of it. After FOSDEM, we are now 
looking ahead to the celebrations of the I Love Free Software Day 
across Europe. We are also catching up with our latest episodes of 
the Software Freedom Podcast focused on European policy and a Legal Corner about the freedom to 
study source code. </p>

<p>It all started in Brussels, at FOSDEM. As always, the weekend was
intense, inspiring, and full of familiar and new faces. Our booth
quickly became a place to stop, chat, and exchange ideas while getting
your hands on our newest merchandise: two new T-shirts (cool kids and
PMPC!) and a new design of our ilovefs red socks! -<a
href="/order/index.html">remember you can get all the
merchandise at our website</a>-. Connecting with so many people in
person, hearing your stories, and feeling the shared energy around Free
Software was a real highlight for us.</p>

<p>FOSDEM is also an important opportunity for us to present and discuss
our work. Once again this year, the FSFE was among the organisers of the
Legal &amp; Policy Issues Devroom. The day opened with Gabriel's talk,
<a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/c9HPQ27Mb8ucgxJhLfy4Hx">"An
Introduction to Law and Free Software"</a>, which set the
stage for a series of engaging discussions. Among them, Alex, together 
with Michael Schuster and Tommaso Bernabo, addressed <a
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/1Doq7FkTms1PriUjhdTYK2">the role of Free
Software in the Cyber Resilience Act. This was followed by a lively
Q&amp;A </a>with the audience. Later that day, Lucas led a panel
discussion on <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/1Doq7FkTms1PriUjhdTYK2">Interoperability
regulation in the EU,</a> joined by representatives from the European
Commission and the Data Rights organisation.</p>

<div class="standout-text-bggreen">
<p>During FOSDEM, we launched a new survey to collect input on how
voluntary security attestation programmes for Free Software could be
designed under Article 25 of the Cyber Resilience Act. The survey
contains 27 questions, but participants are not required to answer all
of them. We welcome feedback until the end of February. <a
href="https://dialog-cybersicherheit.limesurvey.net/113884">Take
part in the survey</a>!</p>
</div>

<p>As in previous years, the Legal &amp; Policy Devroom attracted
significant interest, with highly engaging topics and thoughtful
questions from attendees. We would like to thank our co-organisers Karen
Sandler, Tom Marble, Bradley M. Kühn, and Richard Fontana for helping
make this Devroom happen. It is truly a pleasure to organise it together
with all of you.</p>


<p>Besides this Devroom, and in addition to co-organising two others
(Funding the Free Software Ecosystem and Free Software Mobile), several
FSFE staffers were also busy  participating in other Devrooms. Tobias was
invited to speak about <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/ccD34bimEMfbToNe68GoSs">Friendica</a> in the
Social Web Devroom, while Bonnie and Sofía presented our European
coding competition for teenagers, <a href="http://yh4f.org/">YH4F</a>,
which is currently in its programming period <a 
href="https://share.fsfe.org/apps/forms/s/iqeXngDaatNeDd2z9jyCa8se">(registration
is still possible!</a>). Besides, Bonnie together with our volunteer 
Øjvind, <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/if59oTRrd1WZFRnq9ZyWTk">introduced the
audience to podcasting with Free Software</a>, as part of the Audio,
Video &amp; Graphics Creation Devroom. They also seized the opportunity to record a
live episode at FOSDEM, which we can't wait to publish soon!</p>

<div class="standout-text-bggreen">
<p>Speaking of podcasts, in the busy weeks leading up to FOSDEM we
released two episodes of the Software Freedom Podcast focused on
European policy: one offering an overview of the<a href="/news/podcast/2026/episode-44.html"> most
relevant current EU initiatives affecting Free Software</a>,
and another covering the <a
href="/news/podcast/2026/episode-45.html">latest
news on the RED directive</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Back in Brussels, we also received exciting news about Ada &amp;
Zangemann! Matthias and our volunteer Nico participated in the FOSDEM
main track with <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/fcJZshU98vy4MySDRVTC9q">a talk on automating the translation of a bestseller to
spark children's interest in coding</a>. For the first time, the Dutch
version of the book was available for purchase at our stand! Thanks to
Nico, who put in a lot of work, for making it possible! Moreover, our
volunteer Stephane produced several copies in English and German using a
homemade Braille printing device. If you know anyone who is visually
impaired, please get in touch with us!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, more volunteers, this time in December in Denmark, sent a
letter to a Danish parliamentary commission regarding the implementation
of the digital wallet. The FSFE local group participated in a follow-up,
which was ultimately submitted by IT-Politisk Forening, a local
association better equipped to provide input on Danish policy issues.
This prompted numerous questions to the Minister about why the upcoming
digital wallet is not fully Free Software, as such solutions must
be.</p>

<p>We also come with news from Spain. The newest Legal Corner article
focuses on a September 2025 ruling from the Spanish Supreme Court, <a 
href="/news/2026/news-20260205-01.html">that
provides a legal precedent and underlines the importance of transparency
in source code and algorithms, and support for the freedom to study!</a> 
When public authorities in Spain use algorithms, in decision-making that 
affects citizens, they are obliged to allow citizens to
understand how the algorithms work.</p>

<h3>Celebrate with us the I Love Free Software Day!</h3>

<p>While all of this has been happening, we have also been busy
preparing for something very close to our hearts: <a href="/activities/ilovefs/">I Love Free Software
Day</a>, which is coming up this week. We are getting ready to
celebrate Free Software and the people behind it: developers, activists,
translators, designers, and supporters who make this movement what it
is, across Europe. </p>

<p>This year, we shine a spotlight on Free Software maintainers, the 
dedicated individuals who ensure Free Software projects stay available, 
functional, and up-to-date across systems. Their work is essential for 
all of us who rely on Free Software every day. Maintaining packages is 
often time- and resource-intensive, requiring powerful systems to 
build, test, and troubleshoot them.</p> 

<p>With I Love Free Software 
Day 2026, we celebrate their commitment, expertise, and passion that 
keep the Free Software ecosystem thriving. Let’s recognise their 
efforts and say a heartfelt thank you to all maintainers!</p>
