<h1>GNU Health opts for REUSE </h1>

<p> 
In the framework of the REUSE Booster initiative, the FSFE  provides 
individual assessments and direct assistance to Free Software projects 
in the implementation of the REUSE best practices. GNU Health, a 
project that combines social medicine with technology, has recently 
become REUSE compliant. We have talked with Dr. Luis Falcón, its 
founder.

<h2 id="boosting-reuse">Boosting REUSE</h2>

<p> 
Understanding and complying with legal obligations can be a burden 
sometimes, especially when reusing software from different projects 
that are released under different licenses. The <a 
href="https://reuse.software/"> REUSE</a> initiative, introduced by the 
Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), aims to make the communication 
of licensing and copyright information of Free Software projects easier 
for everyone. With a set of best practices and the helper tool, adding 
this legal information in every single file of the project becomes a 
simple process. 
</p>

<p> 
Last year, the FSFE launched <a href="https://reuse.software/booster/"> 
REUSE Booster</a>, an initiative that aims to directly assist and 
support projects in the process of implementing REUSE. As a result of 
those efforts, <strong>the Free Software project  <a 
href="https://gnuhealth.org/"> GNU Health</a> has recently adopted the 
REUSE specification 3.0 </strong> in its components: Hospital 
Management System (both server and client) and Thalamus (the message 
server for the GH Federation).

<h2 id="gnu-health-and-its-reuse-adoption">GNU Health and its REUSE adoption</h2>

<p> 
GNU Health is a community driven Free Software project from GNU 
Solidario; a non-profit humanitarian organisation that focuses both on 
technology and on social medicine. The software has been adopted by 
different organisations and national public health systems around the 
globe. From now on, users and re-users of GNU Health will have a clear 
overview of the copyright notices and license terms thanks to the 
standardised way of displaying it by following the REUSE specification.
</p>	 
	 


<blockquote>
<p><em> “The task of manually keeping track, displaying and 
writing the legal information in large Free/Libre projects like GNU 
Health can be daunting. The REUSE project makes this tedious process 
simple. I invite the Libre software community to adopt REUSE as the 
standard for displaying legal information to boost development, 
productivity and integration among projects.”</em> 
</p> 
<cite>Dr. Luis  Falcón, founder of GNU Solidario and author of GNU Health. </cite>
</blockquote>



<p> 
In this short video interview, Dr. Luis Falcón shares with us how the 
process of adopting REUSE was for the GNU Health team, while also 
encourages other Free Software projects to join them in displaying  
their licensing and copyright information in an unambiguous and 
perfectly human- and machine-readable way.

<h2 id="reuse-adopters">REUSE adopters</h2>

<p> 
At the moment the <a href="https://api.reuse.software/"> REUSE API</a> 
has 1300+ projects registered as REUSE compliant. Within those we can 
highlight, among others, projects such as <strong> curl, and 
cosmoscout-vr from the German Aerospace Center (DLR)</strong>. The 
<strong>Linux Kernel </strong>has also partially adopted REUSE, 
and the well-known <strong>KDE community</strong>, included REUSE in 
their licensing policy and they already migrated all their frameworks 
to the recommended standard. 
</p>

<p> 
We welcome other developers to adopt REUSE and look forward to feedback 
and collaboration. If you want to contact us, you need an extra hand in 
implementing REUSE in your project, or you just want to participate in 
the discussion, we invite you to join the <a 
href="https://lists.fsfe.org/postorius/lists/reuse.lists.fsfe.org"> mailing list.</a> 
</p>

<h2 id="thanks-to-all-our-volunteers-contributors-and-supporters-">Thanks to all our volunteers, contributors, and supporters!</h2>

<p> 
This is therefore a great opportunity to thank our volunteers and 
external contributors to REUSE for their great work in continuing 
improving the tool and documentation but also for keeping up an ongoing 
and fruitful discussion regarding its specification. 
</p>

<p> 
The contribution of all our supporters also allows our continuing work 
on REUSE as well as on all our activities. You can join them by 
becoming a supporter, tell your friends how they can support our work 
with a small donation, or even ask your family to support the FSFE and 
our campaigns as a meaningful holiday gift.
