        <p>Read in our September newsletter about a new strong alliance formed by administrations, business and civil society organisations asking for "A place for public code". Also read about our call to apply for FSFE support for your local project, our job vacancy, and about our other diverse community activities.</p>

		<h2 id="-a-place-for-public-code-">&quot;A place for public code&quot;</h2>

        <p>A special interest group composed of the FSFE and many other civil society organisations as well as major German municipalities like Munich and Frankfurt has published a <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/papers/20200910-Ein-Ort-fuer-oeffentlichen-Code.v1.pdf">working paper (DE)</a> as a first concept for a common code repository for the public sector. Under the slogan <a href="/news/2020/news-20200910-01.html">&quot;A place for public code&quot;</a>, the interest group now wants to pave the way for one portal through which the public administration in Germany can exchange and jointly develop Free Software in an adequate and legally compliant manner. </p>

       <p>With the slogan &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot;, the FSFE has been campaigning since 2017 that publicly financed code developments should be published under a Free Software license. Facilitating the exchange of this software is just as important as its publication. And while other countries in Europe lead the way with other approaches but similar initiatives - for example the <a href="/news/2018/news-20180601-01.html">Technology Transfer Centre</a> in Spain or <a href="/news/2020/news-20200609-01.html">Etalab</a> in France - in the biggest economy in Europe, &quot;a common place to exchange this software within public institutions is still missing in Germany&quot;, explains Alexander Sander, EU Policy Manager of FSFE.</p>
        
        <p>The initiative invites administrations, politicians and the Free Software community and other interested  stakeholders to participate in the discussion and to further develop the concept.</p>

		<p>From international campaigns to local information booths, our successful spreading of software freedom is based on many shoulders from active members within our community. The FSFE has always been keen on supporting initiatives and activities from local FSFE groups to single supporters. We happily support you with our expertise, our information material, our networks, or even financially.</p>
		
		<p>To help formalize our support we will from now on <a href="/news/2020/news-20200907-01.html">run a call for FSFE community projects</a> every two months. Participating in the first edition is as simple as filling out <a href="/community/projects-call/projects-call.html">a short online form</a> until 4 October 2020.</p>

			<p>The biggest financial impact the FSFE faces in these times of physical distancing is the cancellation of Free Software conferences, including our own events. To keep the software freedom movement solid and alive, please consider <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate?referrer=nl">donating a part of your conference budget to Free Software organisations, including the FSFE</a>.</p>

				<li>On Saturday 12 September we ran our first online web-a-thon. Nine participants joined us full- or part-time for one day to update and improve our webpage with translations, content and technical issues. Among the visible things we updated were our <a href="/about/about.html">about</a> page and our <a href="/contact/contact.html">contact</a> page. This is in line with major improvements we already did throughout the year on our <a href="/activities/activities.html">activities</a> page, our <a href="/about/team.html">team</a> page and our <a href="/index.html">front page</a>. If you would like to help us with our web-development, <a href="/contribute/web/web.html">join our web team</a>.</li>
				<li>On 18 September, the FSFE&#39;s Policy Manager Alexander Sander gave a <a href="https://eslib.re/2020/programa/">talk at the esLibre conference</a> about the advantages of using Free Software in the public sector.</li>
				<li>On 10 September, Alexander Sander gave a lightning talk at the State of the Source Summit about &quot;Public Money? Public Code! â€“ Global problems need global solutions!&quot;</li>
				<li>A local TV station located at the biggest lake of central Europe, the lake of Constance, created a special <a href="https://bodenseetv.ch/kfs-12-14-09-2020-open-source-militaerfahrzeuge-auf-dem-boulevard/">episode</a> about the background of Free Software and its use in the educational sector and during apprenticeships. Among the interviewees is Peter Bittner who also managed to promote the FSFE with prominent use of our promotion material.</li>
