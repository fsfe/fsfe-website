    <title>esLibre 2020: Public Money Public Code â€“ Global problems need global solutions! online, Spain</title>

    <body>
      <p>At the esLibre 2020 confrence the FSFE's Policy Manager Alexander Sander will talk about the advantages of using Free Software in the public sector, as well as about the learnings from the corona crisis and why it is now even more important to use Free Software than ever before. In times when humanity needs to work together to find solutions for a crisis, we cannot afford to spend our time on reinventing the wheel. Global problems need global solutions! Free Software solutions developed in one country can be reused and adapted in another one. Publicly financed software developed for the public sector must be made publicly available under Free Software licences. The talk will take place on Friday, the 18. September, at 17:30.</p>
