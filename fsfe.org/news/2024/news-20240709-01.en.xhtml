<h1>Belgian court’s decision impacts the future of Router Freedom</h1>

<p>In an historic ruling within the EU, a Belgian court has upheld 
the decision of the country’s regulator to introduce Router Freedom 
for fiber networks. The objections, raised by a local internet service 
provider, were deemed unfounded. This landmark decision represents a 
significant victory for consumer rights, and we urge other national 
regulators to follow this example.</p>

<p>Internet services providers (ISPs) 
have been pushing back in different ways to limit the ability of 
end-users to choose and use their own routers for internet connection. 
After <a href="/news/2023/news-20231113-02.html">a thorough
regulatory process</a> which officially confirmed 
Router Freedom in Belgium, the local ISP Orange contested the 
decision of the Belgian Institute for Postal Services and 
Telecommunications (BIPT) alleging lack of proportionality. Although 
past court cases in other countries have been decided in favour of 
end-users, the Orange vs the BIPT case represents an important victory for 
Router Freedom: this is the first time a court refers to fiber networks 
from the perspective of the regulatory framework established by the 
2020 reform of the telecommunications law in Europe.</p> 

<h3>Orange’s 
allegations rebutted by the court</h3>

<p>In September 2023, the BIPT, following the BEREC guidelines, defined 
the position of the “network termination point“. This means that 
routers, modems and optical network terminals 
(ONT) would not be part of the ISPs’ infrastructure, opening up the 
possibility for freedom of choice in the equipment market. The 
regulatory decision encompassed fiber networks, following by a 
comprehensive technical, economical and legal analysis conducted by the 
regulator.</p>

<p>Soon after the publication of the decision, <a href="https://www.bipt.be/verbraucher/veroffentlichung/urteil-des-marktegerichtshofs-vom-22.-mai-2024-anfechtung-orange-belgium">Orange 
started litigation</a> at the Market Court in Brussels against the 
regulator, listing a long list of arguments against the decision:
 </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	The BIPT was not diligent in the decision-making process;
	</li> 
	<li>
	The BIPT insufficiently researched the market and technical situation 
	in Belgium to decide to place the NTP at Point A;
	</li>
	<li>
	The decision should be reversed because it violates proportionality. 
	The market situation in Belgium is different from other countries that 
	decided in favour of Router Freedom. Instead, Point B should have been 
	chosen;
	</li>
	<li>
	Orange was under the assumption that the BIPT would choose Point B, therefore violated its trust;
	</li>
	<li>
	The decision was not technology-neutral because it excluded other terminal 
	equipment (like TV decoders) from its scope.
	</li>
</ul>


<p>
<strong>The court dismissed all Orange’s arguments as unfounded, 
confirming the BIPT’s decision to introduce Router Freedom in 
Belgium</strong> by defining the position of the NTP at Point A. The 
court ruled that:
</p><ul>
	<li>
	Although the court has the authority to check the legitimacy of 
	the regulator’s decision, it should not regulate in its place. In 
	any case, the BIPT has not violated the principles of proper governance 
	and was diligent in following the regulatory framework proposed by 
	BEREC, in particular the <a href="https://www.berec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/document_register_store/2020/3/BoR_(20)_46_BEREC_Guidelines_NTP.pdf">Guidelines 
	for the Identification of the 
	NTP</a>;
	</li> 
	<li>
	The BIPT was not unreasonable to set the NTP at Point A, as 
	Orange stated multiple times. Instead, the regulator acted 
	diligently and took into account the different technologies (cable, 
	copper, fibre). The BIPT determined that there are no objective 
	technological reasons to limit freedom of terminal equipment. The 
	purpose of setting the NTP at point A is to create a framework that 
	stimulates competition;
	</li> 
	<li>
	Deciding in favour of Point A was 
	proportionate. The regulator diligently analysed competition in the 
	equipment market; the costs for operators and the service provision, 
	sustainability and energy consumption aspects. Orange did not 
	provide concrete data to demonstrate that the BIPT insufficiently 
	researched technological necessities to limit freedom of 
	terminal equipment. The situation in each country is indeed 
	different. That’s why regulators are required by BEREC to assess 
	whether there are objective criteria to limit this freedom: the
	BIPT’s comprehensive assessment demonstrated that there are none;
	</li> 
	<li>
	The BIPT has not violated the trust of the operators. It is 
	not sufficient for Orange to claim that their own concrete interest 
	is better served with a different outcome than the one proposed by 
	the BIPT (limiting Router Freedom at Point A). The BIPT did not 
	arbitrarily determine the position of the NTP;
	</li> 
	<li>
	Media boxes and TV decoders 
	are not the same as routers and modems, so they should be treated 
	differently.
	</li>  
</ul>


<p>The FSFE emphasises the importance of this ruling as the court has 
not only clarified the procedural aspects, but confirmed the Belgian 
regulator's diligence in analysing all the market, technical and 
sustainability aspects concerning Router Freedom. It should be 
highlighted that <strong>the court reaffirmed the BIPT’s conclusion that no 
technological necessity to limit Router Freedom in fiber networks was 
found. This resonates with FSFE’s demands that ISPs’ commercial 
interests should not prevail over consumer rights</strong>. This ruling should 
serve as an precedent for other EU member states who have argued the 
existence of such technological constraints in fiber networks.</p>

<h3>The future of Router Freedom is under attack, help us safeguarding 
it</h3> <p>For many years ISPs have been pushing back in different 
 manners to limit the ability of end-users to choose and use their own 
 routers for internet connection. Their lobbying power has been intense 
 against Router Freedom in fiber networks. Countries like <a href="/news/2023/news-20231201-01.html">Austria and 
 Latvia</a> have prioritized operators’ interests by not safeguarding 
 end-users’ freedom of routers, while others like <a href="/news/2022/news-20220628-01.html">Greece and Croatia</a>
 have promoted a compromise by allowing Router Freedom in DSL and coax 
 but excluding fiber. Particularly concerning are countries, like <a href="/news/2023/news-20230915-01.html">Germany</a>, which have 
 positively decided in the past in favour of Router Freedom but are 
 facing pressure from ISPs to exclude fiber networks.</p>

<p><strong>The FSFE is the only civil-society organisation that 
<a href="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/router-freedom-tracker_581123">systematically 
monitors</a> and advocates in favour of Router Freedom 
across Europe</strong>. We have intervened in key regulatory processes, 
and articulated alliances and coalitions with local digital rights 
groups, 
industry representatives and consumer protection organisations. We have 
participated in dozens of conferences and events in Europe, and have 
been quoted by the media, think tanks and academics.</p> <p>Most 
 importantly, we are aiming at the future. Our advocacy does not expire 
 in the short term. <a href="https://deviceneutrality.org/">We are 
 committed to Device Neutrality</a> as we believe 
 everyone should be able to bypass gatekeepers – these small or 
 large corporations blocking their rights –  to run Free Software on 
 their devices. For example, while <a href="/news/2024/news-20240627-01.html">Apple is hampering software 
 freedom 
 on smartphones</a>, ISPs prohibit subscribers to have their own routers 
 running Free Software operating systems.</p> 

<p>An open, healthy and 
neutral Internet needs Router Freedom, as this freedom refers to the 
hardware layer of Net Neutrality. Indeed, <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/e1f1154f-ee2f-11ed-a05c-01aa75ed71a1">Router 
Freedom was considered 
a top priority</a> by a study on the future of the Net Neutrality 
Regulation commissioned by the EC last year. The study cited the FSFE 
in several parts.</p>

<p>
New challenges are appearing in the horizon. Next year the EU will 
assess its telecom legislation that tasked BEREC to develop the 
guidelines on the NTP. In parallel, as the importance of satellite 
networks grows, it is not clear how regulators will react to lack of 
freedom of choice among proprietary devices.

<blockquote>Router Freedom is key for an open and neutral Internet. We 
have achieved so much in the last five years balancing the power of 
ISPs to promote software freedom in routers and modems! Your support is 
vital for our advocacy and policy engagement in favour of your right to 
choose and use your own router. <strong>Please become an FSFE supporter today 
and help us keep our independence!</strong></blockquote>
