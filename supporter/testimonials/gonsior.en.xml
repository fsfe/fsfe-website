	  Free software is directly or indirectly a benefit for all citizens -
	  and it returns control to them over their own data. A single person is
	  not able to support this substantially. In this area the FSFE carries
	  out important and successful work, even contributing to european
	  legislative procedures - that's why i decided to support FSFE.
