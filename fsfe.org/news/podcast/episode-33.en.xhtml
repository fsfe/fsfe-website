<h1>SFP#33: Policy and EU: Coalition treaty in Germany and its role for Free Software</h1>

<p>Recently, the German coalition treaty from the CDU/CSU and SPD has been published with over 140 pages. 
In our latest episode Alexander Sander and Bonnie Mehring talk about the coalition treaty and break down 
the standing of Free Software in it.</p>

<audio-player />

<p>Listen to the 33rd episode of our Software Freedom Podcast and find out what the coalition treaty outlines
 for Free Software in Germany and where spillover effects to the EU policy are to be expected. Bonnie and Alex 
 discuss where we, as a civil society, need to keep an eye out for threats to our software freedom, and what the
  options are for the Free Software ecosystem in the future. Together they also talk about the sudden decision to
   remove Jutta Horstmann, former CEO of  the German Center for Digital Sovereignty (ZenDiS in German), from her
    position and cover the recent symposium "Public Money? Public Code! in practice”, organised by the FSFE.</p>
