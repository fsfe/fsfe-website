    <h1>171 public institutions removed non-free advertisement</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">Only one month after the PDFreaders campaign of FSFE
started, 171 public institutions have removed advertisements for proprietary
PDF readers from their websites. Particularly outstanding were the responses
from Croatia, Russia and Slovenia. In Croatia almost all institutions deleted
advertisements. Half of those contacted in Russia and Slovenia fulfilled FSFE's
request.</p>

<p>"Several institutions replied stating that they agree with <a
  href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/letter.html">our concerns</a>, and that they will
modify their websites", said campaign manager Matthias Kirschner. Amongst those
are a number of ministries, parliaments, law enforcement agencies, and the
Belgian Prime Minister's chancellery.</p>

<p>Campaigns like this are made possible by a <a
  href="http://www.fsfe.org/contribute/index.en.html">community of
  volunteers</a>, and <a
  href="http://www.fsfe.org/donate/donate.en.html">financial supporters</a>.
FSFE is following-up with the <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/buglist.html">
  remaining organisations</a> in order to get the remaining advertisements
removed.</p>
