<h1>"Back to school" for EU and German policy +++ Ada available worldwide</h1>

<p>
September brings the resumption of EU politics and the middle of the term of the 
current German government, and we look at them from a Free Software 
perspective. 'Ada &amp; Zangemann' can now be ordered internationally, 
and you can help us translate our 'What is Free Software' video into 
more EU languages. And remember - rooting your device does not void its 
warranty.

<h3 id="#Halftime-for-the-German-government-Thank-you-for-the-fine-words-now-let-the-deeds-speak">Halftime for the German government: Thank you for the fine words, now let the deeds speak!</h3>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), together with an 
alliance of civil society and the Free Software industry, calls on the 
German government to <a href="/news/2023/news-20230829-01.html">implement a sustainable digital policy</a> 
and to provide the necessary funds in the federal budget now.</p>

         
<h3 id="Liability-Interoperability-&amp;-Free-Software-in-EU-what-we-are-expecting">Liability, Interoperability, &amp; Free Software in EU: what we are expecting</h3>
 
<p>After the summer recess, EU institutions are resuming their 
activities at the end of August. In the coming months, we expect to see 
the adoption of legislation that could have an impact on Free Software: 
the Cyber Resilience Act, the Product Liability Directive, the AI Act, 
and the Interoperable Europe Act. <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230824-01.html">What does all this legislation 
mean 
for Free Software and its community?</a>.</p>

<h3 id="#Ada-&amp;-Zangemann-available-now-in-English-worldwide">‘Ada 
&amp; Zangemann’: available now in English worldwide</h3> 
<p>From 29 August the English version of the book <a 
href="/activities/ada-zangemann/index.html">"Ada &amp; Zangemann - A 
Tale of 
Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream"</a> has been  <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230831-01.html">available 
internationally</a>. The book tells the story of the famous inventor 
Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to 
experiment with hardware and software and realises how important it is 
for her and others to control technology.</p>

 <p>As users we sometimes face the issue of rooting our devices. We may 
 want to regain control of our device or we may want to keep using a 
 device with an outdated operating system. But we are afraid of losing 
 our legal warranty. Let’s be clear: Just rooting your device and 
 installing new software <a href="/news/2023/news-20230807-01.html">will 
 not void the statutory warranty</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Take-Action-Contribute-to-translate-our-What-is-Free-Software-video">Take Action! Contribute to translate our ‘What is Free Software’ video</h3> 

<p>If you read our email, you already know this. We want to translate 
our video <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/p/9gYSyoEYggsqBExLWjRejL">"What is Free 
Software"</a> into more European languages! This 
video explains in less than 3 minutes why Free Software is important, 
and each translation costs about 250 Euros. Therefore, all 
contributions until the end of September will be used to help our 
community in Europe to get the video in their native languages. Help us 
spreading this message or <a href="/donate/donate.html">making a small contribution</a> to support this 
campaign!</p>

 
<h3 id="Chaos-Communication-Camp-2023-and-FrOSCon" >Chaos 
Communication Camp 2023 and FrOSCon</h3> 
<p>One of our favourite events was back this summer: Chaos Communication Camp 2023! 
This event brought together technologists, activists, and enthusiasts to 
discuss, share, and celebrate technology, privacy, and freedom in 
Brandenburg, Germany. This year, the Free Software Foundation Europe 
joined the campers as part of the 'Bits und Bäume' village.</p>
<p><a href="/news/2023/news-20230825-01.html">Take a look at our talks</a> 
from the event and see what else we did.</p>

<p>
Before that, on the first weekend of August, visitors to FrOSCon in St. 
Augustin could learn more about Free Software at the FSFE booth. One 
focus of the conference was Free Software in German administrations. We 
gave <a href="https://programm.froscon.org/2023/events/2886.html">a talk 
about the German Sovereign Workplace</a> (<a 
href="https://app.media.ccc.de/v/froscon2023-2886-freie_software_fur_deutschlands_verwaltungen">the 
recording can be found here</a>) and one of our volunteers - and her 
daughter! - delighted a young audience with their reading from the book 
"Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream".
</p>

<h3 id="foss-north-videos-and-more-conferences-on-the-way!">foss-north videos and more conferences on the way!</h3>

<p>🇸🇪 Last April we attended <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230509-01.html">foss-north</a>, where FSFE 
co-organised 
a track on political, social, and legal issues around Free Software. 
Among other great speakers, there was a keynote by Lina Ceballos, on 
the Interoperable Europe Act. It took some time, but finally we have 
the videos of this event! <a 
href="https://conf.tube/w/p/dSNeqFG9b73YmxkfdVozsZ">Watch all the 
interesting talks</a> from the 
comfort of your own home! And we hope to see you there next year (as a 
speaker or as a participant 😉).</p>

<p>🇷🇸 You can also join us in our next events! We will be participating in the Balkan Computer 
Congress - BalCCon2k23 in Novi Sad, Serbia, talking about Device 
Neutrality and NGI (8-10 September).</p>

<p>🇵🇹 The NGI initiative will also be 
explained in "Festa do Software Livre" in Aveiro, Portugal, where we 
will also talk about Router Freedom (16-17 September) and also there 
but a few days later (30 September) we will discuss Device Neutrality at the 
"Encontro Nacional de Estudantes de Informatica”.</p> 

<p>🇮🇹 On September 16, we will be celebrating Software Freedom Day in Nembro (Italy) with the 
first reading in Italian of the book ‘Ada &amp; Zangemann’.</p> 

<p>🇩🇪 In Germany, we will be at PITS 2023 - Public-IT-Security (21 
September) in Berlin, in Cologne we will discuss  the role of decentralised social media 
platforms in our society (22 September), and then we will be at Bitkom (27 September) with a talk 
about the Cyber Resilience Act.</p> 

<p><strong>🇨🇭 And if you are around, celebrate with us the 40th Anniversary of GNU! On 27 September, at the 
Volkshaus in Biel/Bienne (Switzerland), join the GNU community to 
celebrate this occasion and help build a future where users' computing 
freedom extends further than ever.</strong></p>
