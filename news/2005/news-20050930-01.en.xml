	Statement of FSFE and FSF Latin America to the 2005 WIPO General Assemblies

   Not continuing what was begun, or changing from a horse to a mule
   midstream, as the honored Indian delegate so eloquently put it, would
   be wasting the time and effort spent on this initiative by all sides,
   North and South. For this reason we strongly support the notion of
   letting the IIM process finish what it began.
