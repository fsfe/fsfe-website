      <p>
        Thanks the consistent support by FSFE and other
        organisations, the WIPO Development Agenda is finally on
        the way to implementation. FSFE's President Karsten
        Gerloff will participate in the meeting of the Committee
        on November 16th to 20th to make sure that Free Software and Open
        Standards take their place in this process.

        FSFE is a registered observer to WIPO. The event is not
        open to the public.
