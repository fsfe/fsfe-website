			<p>On June 13 and 14 there is the first FOSS Backstage event happening in Berlin, Germany. FOSS Backstage intends to become  a platform to discuss and learn about all non-technical aspects of open source development. The FSFE will be present with a booth set up by local FSFE supporters and we are looking forward for people to pass by, ask about Free Software and get to know us in person.</p>
