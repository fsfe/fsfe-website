<h1>TUX&amp;GNU@school - 8th edition</h1>
<p><i>Every two months the column <a href=
"/activities/tgs/tagatschool8.html">
TUX&amp;GNU@school [2]</a> reports about free software, a homepage
on topic and an easy to implement idea. This month I talk about
<a href="http://www.gamgi.org">GAMGI [3]</a>, a free material
education program, about the projects <a href=
"http://www.skolelinux.org">Skolelinux [4]</a> and <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org">KDE Edutainment [5]</a> and about the idea
"Something neat for KDE-Edu" ;-).</i></p>
<p>Welcome to the 8th edition of TUX&amp;GNU@school. In the
meantime I looked after the longstanding newsletter as I promised
in the last edition. There you can subscribe and you receive the
recent version of the column every two months. At the moment the
<a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo">newsletter
[6]</a> exists for five languages. Yes, you heard correctly, there
is another language (<a href=
"/activities/tgs/tgs.html">Spanish
[7]</a>) beneath the existing ones (<a href=
"/activities/tgs/tgs.html">German
[8]</a>, <a href=

<h3>GAMGI - General Atomistic Modelling Graphic Interface</h3>
<p>Some days ago Carlos Pereira sent me an Email in which he asked
me if I couldn't present his program here. Of course I like to do
things like that and would like to do it right now. The following
description originates almost completely from Carlos himself who is
also the lead author of <a href="http://www.gamgi.org">GAMGI
[3]</a> at.</p>
<p>GAMGI stands for General Atomistic Modelling Graphic Interface.
The program is licensed under the <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">GNU GPL [12]</a>
and you can build, view and analyse atomic structures, such as
molecules, crystals, glasses, liquids, etc. with it. GAMGI supports
the 230 crystallographic space groups, and can be used for example
to perform point symmetry and 3D Voronoi analysis. Furthermore
GAMGI supports multiple windows, layers and lights and offers
maximum control over even low-level objects as atoms, bonds and
text objects.</p>
<p>GAMGI comes with XHTML documentation that can be seen with a
browser or the program itself. The program also comes with hundreds
of files describing relevant molecules, clusters and cells. These
are provided in GAMGI XML native format and be loaded
out-of-the-box.</p>
<p><img src="./img/gamgi-screenshot10_1b.png" alt=
"Screenshot 1: GAMGI at work" width="705" height="519" border=
"0" /></p>
<h5>Screenshot 1: GAMGI at work</h5>
<p>GAMGI is written in ANSI C and requires glib 1.2/gtk 1.2,
gtkglarea 1.2, mesa and expat libraries, easily available in all
Linux distributions. Meanwhile the program consists of the
considerable amount of 150,000 lines of code. There are two
<a href="http://www.gamgi.org/contacts/lists.html">mailing lists
[13]</a>, one for helping users and the other one to discuss the
development itself. Andre Truter, a Software Engineer, is building
packages for GAMGI. Currently there are <a href=
"http://www.gamgi.org/download/download.html">packages for SuSE and
Debian [14]</a>. Packages for other systems will be available on
request.</p>
<p>Further on Carlos writes in his mail that, although he has
written GAMGI from zero and it is not a copy of any other program,
he was certainly inspired by other programs as InsightII and
Cerius2 during his PhD thesis. Sure he speaks about the many things
still missing but the program is already quite useful and
especially in the teaching area.</p>
<p>When you have some questions or suggestions <a href=
"mailto:carlos%20AT%20pehoe.civil.ist.utl.pt">Carlos [15]</a> would
surely be interested. But now to the first project of this edition
that is to say to Skolelinux.</p>
<h3>Skolelinux</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.skolelinux.org">Skolelinux [4]</a> involves
a <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian [16]</a> based
distribution which is targeted at the use in schools. It was and is
the goal of the distribution to offer everything configured with an
easy and simple base installation. This because today a lot of
teachers have to administrate the computer pool in their
school.</p>
<p>Many thanks go to Knut Yrvin, the Norwegian project leader, and
Kurt Gramlich, the leader of the German Skolelinux project, for the
replies to my questions. Perhaps some of you have already noticed
that Skolelinux is a <a href="http://www.skolelinux.no">project
from the North of Europe [17]</a>, from Norway to be precise.
"Skole" means "school" and what "Linux" means should be clear,
isn't it ;-).</p>
<p>The project came into being in June 2001 when Petter
Reinholdtsen and Knut Yrvin talked at a summer party about the
misery in school. Almost exclusively there was deployed proprietary
software with user-unfriendly licences. This should be changed and
today there are surely <a href=
"http://www.skolelinux.org/portal/user_experience/test_schools">more
than 200 schools [18]</a> in Norway alone which work with
Skolelinux. Furthermore the project is capable of paying three
people full time and in addition to this there are a number of
volunteers doing short stints.</p>
<p>Arisen as a Debian derivative in Norway last year Skolelinux
merged more or less with the <a href=
"http://wiki.debian.net/?DebianEdu">Debian subproject DebianEDU
[19]</a>. Surely this was quite important for the circumstance that
people from different countries were now interested in Skolelinux.
And so we arrive at Kurt Gramlich and Skolelinux Germany, who
adapted the school distribution to country specific situations. By
the way this means not only translating it into the own language
but also things as screen locking at school which is not necessary
in every country.</p>
<p><img src="./img/skole-icon-big.png" alt=
"Screenshot 2: Skolelinux Logo" width="566" height="226" border=
"0" /></p>
<h5>Screenshot 2: Skolelinux Logo</h5>
<p>In Norway the project can count on the support of the state and
some firms. Additionally they are making a feasibility study about
Skolelinux in schools of Oslo. Before I forget it, Skolelinux has
now arrived at its frist stable version: <a href=
"http://www.skolelinux.org/portal/get_started/download">Skolelinux
Venus 1.0 [20]</a>. And we are getting thrilled about the coming
version which will be based on Debian Sarge which includes more
recent software.</p>
<p>Further countries with Skolelinux offshoots are e.g. France,
Greece and Uganda. Admittedly the German Skolelinux project seems
to be the most active one beneath the original one in Skandinavia.
These people, who are all volunteers, are working extremely fast
and are represented with a booth at almost every Free Software
event in the country. They are also very strong in <a href=
"http://www.skolelinux.org/portal/documentation/">documentation
[21]</a> and they have with <a href=
"http://www.skolelinux.de">Skolelinux.de [22]</a> their own
homepage. In GÃ¼tersloh (Germany) they even run a small test centre
where they develop and teach on a regular base.</p>
<p>A few exemplary works of Skolelinux Germany are e.g. a possible
integration of the <a href=
"http://www.ilias.uni-koeln.de/ios/index.html">learning management
system ILIAS [23]</a> or <a href="http://www.moodle.org">moodle
[24]</a>, a Windows binding or the <a href=
"http://developer.skolelinux.no/qualityManagement/DQ/requirementsSpecification.html.en">
product concept catalogue for quality management [25]</a>. For the
future there is enough to do not only in Germany what means that
some of you can contribute confidently. Possible starting points
are an even better documentation, the translation into your own
national language or programming of simple education software. It
would be especially interesting if you had some pedagogical
knowledge.</p>
<p>Addendum: At the this year's <a href=
"http://www.systems-world.de/">Systems in Munich (Germany) [26]</a>
they received the <a href=
"http://www.linuxnewmedia.de/Award_2004/award2004/">Linux New Media
Award [27]</a> in the category <i>Best Newcomer
Distribution</i>.</p>
<p>We are thrilled about what is happening in and with Skolelinux
in the future and I will keep you informed. But now to the second
project of this edition where Anne-Marie presents recent news about
the KDE Edutainment project.</p>
<h3>KDE-Edu in KDE 3.3</h3>
<p>As you know, KDE 3.3 has been released by the end of August and
the bug fix version 3.3.1 was released just a few days ago. There
have been some changes in the <a href="http://edu.kde.org">KDE-Edu
[5]</a> applications.</p>
<p>We have two new programs:</p>
<ul class="noindent">
<li><a href="http://edu.kde.org/kwordquiz">KWordQuiz [28]</a> is a
replacement for FlashKard with a few more functionalities. It's a
vocabulary learning program with flash card mode or multiple choice
mode. Some nice feedback informs you about your score.</li>
<li><a href="http://edu.kde.org/kturtle">KTurtle [29]</a> is a new
Logo interpreter. It features an integrated Logo interpreter, full
screen mode, a powerful editor to type your code and more. The Logo
programming language is very easy and thus it can be used by young
children. A unique quality of Logo is that the commands or
instructions can be translated and KTurtle already has translations
for ten languages.</li>
<li style="list-style: none">KTurtle won the <a href=
"http://www.kde.nl/nieuws/2004-10-01-kturtle_prize/">third prize
[30]</a> in an educational programming contest by the <a href=
"http://www.linuxmag.nl/nl/4137085f61440#a41370aad80c4d">Dutch
Linux Programming magazine [31]</a> (only in Dutch).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://edu.kde.org/khangman">KHangman [32]</a> has been
improved following a nice <a href=
"http://www.obso1337.org/misc/khangman.pdf">usability study
[33]</a>. <a href="http://edu.kde.org/ktouch/">KTouch [34]</a>
(touch typing) and <a href="http://edu.kde.org/keduca/">KEduca
[35]</a> (a test maker) have new maintainers. <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/kstars/">KStars [36]</a> is becoming one of the
best astronomy program in GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>For the future, we would like to build a mathematical program
aimed to students aged 8 to 15 about areas, perimeters, numbers and
such. A program about <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/kgeography/">geography [37]</a> is also being
developed, the main difficulty here is to make the maps (use free
maps and adapt them). In all educational programs, the data is the
most difficult part as it needs to be translated in the maximum of
languages possible.</p>
<p>Instead of the presentation of a special idea I want to refer to
Anne-Marie's calling: create data for free education programs and
send it to the KDE-Edu project.</p>
<p>And at the end follows the news.</p>
<h3>News and up to date program versions</h3>
<h4>KEduca icons contest <i>(<a href=
"http://edu.kde.org">edu.kde.org</a> - <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/news.php#itemKEducaiconscontest">04.10.2004</a>)</i></h4>
<p><a href="http://edu.kde.org/keduca/">KEduca [35]</a> has found a
new maintainer, Henrique Pinto. Henrique started to work quickly on
KEduca and made it a KPart (that means you can open keduca files
embedded in Konqueror for example). He also coded compression of
the test file so the pupils cannot read it. Now KEduca needs new
icons, you can find all the details on the <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/keduca/icons.php">KEduca-icons [38]</a> page or
on the <a href=
"http://www.kde-look.org/news/index.php?id=126&amp;PHPSESSID=44c65d6116923732fbc4ab484d6ba923">
KDE-Look website [39]</a>. So if you are an artist, this is a great
way to contribute!</p>
<h4>Asking For Maintainers <i>(<a href=
"http://edu.kde.org">edu.kde.org</a> - <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/news.php#itemAskingForMaintainers">24.09.2004</a>)</i></h4>
<p><a href="http://edu.kde.org/keduca/">KEduca [35]</a>, <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/kmessedwords/">KMessedWords [40]</a> and
<a href="http://edu.kde.org/kvoctrain/">KVocTrain [41]</a> are
looking for new maintainers. What does that mean? KMessedWords GUI
should be re-arranged and the main thing to do is to i18n the
dictionary so that all KDE languages can be used. A possible
feature is also to cut the words in syllables. Using KHangMan data
files (with hints when available) could also be done. This is not
too demanding and could be possible for a beginner. For KEduca, the
main feature would be to encrypt the xml file so that pupils cannot
read the answers. Porting to current kdelibs would also be
required. KVocTrain requires more work and a complete rewrite
should be done as the code is really very old. Anyone interested
should come forward on the <a href=
"https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-edu">kde-edu mailinglist
[42]</a>. Be assured you'll get plenty of help and you'll share
great fun with the KDE community!</p>
<h4>Working on improving documentation <i>(<a href=
"http://edu.kde.org">edu.kde.org</a> - <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/news.php#itemWorkingonimprovingdocumentation">23.08.2004</a>)</i></h4>
<p>The <a href="http://conference2004.kde.org/">aKademy KDE World
Summit [43]</a> has started and, while no KDE-Edu people are
present, Anne-Marie is working with some people there. An IRC
meeting has been done today with Phil and Lauri from the KDE
documentation team. Several ideas has been discussed: having a
kid-oriented doc, having Quick Start pages for each program,
writing a new template for edu docs... We also try to go through
each Handbook and see what could be improved. Thanks a lot to the
Documentation team people who demonstrate how team work makes KDE
better! See this <a href="http://edu.kde.org/doc/">page [44]</a> to
know how to better write your documentation.</p>
<h4>Usability Study for KHangMan <i>(<a href=
"http://edu.kde.org">edu.kde.org</a> - <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/news.php#itemUsabilityStudyforKHangMan">23.08.2004</a>)</i></h4>
<p>Celeste Paul wrote a very complete <a href=
"http://www.obso1337.org/misc/khangman.pdf">usability study
[33]</a> for <a href="http://edu.kde.org/khangman">KHangMan
[32]</a>. Her suggestions will be applied and you can follow
progress on that on <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/khangman/usability.php">the KHangMan usability
page [45]</a>. Thanks to Celeste for this amazing work!</p>
<h4>KWordQuiz in KDE-Edu <i>(<a href=
"http://edu.kde.org">edu.kde.org</a> - <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/news.php#itemKWordQuizinKDEEdu">14.05.2004</a>)</i></h4>
<p><a href="http://edu.kde.org/kwordquiz">KWordQuiz [28]</a> joined
the kdeedu module and replaced <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/flashkard">FlashKard [46]</a>. KWordQuiz will
allow you to study your vocabulary words (WordQuiz and kvtml
formats supported) and keep all FlashKard functionalities. In
addition, the Quiz mode is great and the Editing mode very
powerful. <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/">LinuxMagazine
[47]</a> wrote two pages about KWordQuiz in Issue 41 and kindly put
<a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/issue/41/KWordQuiz.pdf">the
article online [48]</a>, thanks a lot!.</p>
<h4>Developers news: KNewStuff documentation <i>(<a href=
"http://edu.kde.org">edu.kde.org</a> - <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/news.php#itemDevelopersnewsKNewStuffdocumentation">
15.04.2004</a>)</i></h4>
<p>The KNewStuff library is now in kdelibs therefore available for
applications that need it. KLettres in cvs HEAD and KHangMan
(make_it_cool branch) are successfully using it. This library
allows the program to get and install in a few mouse clicks new
data from a website. A HowTo is available in <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org/development/knewstuff.php">the developer
section of this website [49]</a> to help you with using this new
library.</p>
<h4>KTouch needs feedback <i>(<a href=

<p>Andreas, the current <a href="http://ktouch.sf.net">KTouch
[50]</a> co-maintainer, will start a new version of KTouch. He has
designed a new <a href=
"http://ktouch.sf.net/download/new_ktouch_concept.txt">concept
[51]</a> and would like feedback on it. Please stay in touch with
him and send <a href=

<h4>About the author:</h4>
<p>Mario Fux finished 1999 the PrimarlehrerInnenseminar in Brig,
after which he then caught up on the mathematical and natural
scientifical matura. Currently he studies at the <a href=
"http://www.unizh.ch">university of Zurich</a> in the main subject
<a href="http://www.paed.unizh.ch">education (pedagogy)</a> and
<a href="http://www.ifi.unizh.ch/">computer sciences</a> as the
subsidiary subject. Together with two colleagues he founded the
<a href="http://www.edux.ch">"ALIS - Arbeitsgruppe Linux an
Schulen"</a> (Swiss work group for linux at school). And if he is
not spending his time in front of the PC, he sits at his nature
pond in the <a href="http://www.randa.ch">mountains</a>.</p>
