        <title>FSFE Aarhus local group meeting in Aarhus, Denmark</title>

    <body>
      <p>The next Local Group meeting in FSFE Aarhus is coming up. If you are interested in Free Software, come over and join us! We will discuss the foundational document for the FSFE activities in Denmark, Campaigns and Activities, Happenings and events (ideas are welcome), and the Report from the FSFE GA in Arnhem. Also we have received a lot of printed material regarding the Public Money Public Code campaign - we'll discuss how best to use it. The meeting takes place at Silkeborgvej 260, 8230 Åbyhøj at 17:00 hours. The location is kindly sponsored by [Magenta ApS](https://magenta.dk).</p>
