  <h1>Software Freedom in Europe 2020</h1>

		<p><em>&quot;Software Freedom in Europe&quot;</em> is the yearly report of the Free Software Foundation Europe e.V. (FSFE). In one document, it gives you a breakdown of important things the FSFE has done and achieved during the last 12 months.</p>
		
		<p>No report about the status of software freedom and the FSFE in 2020 can possibly be written without mentioning the impact the global spread of COVID-19 had on our organisation and the global process of digitisation. <em>Software Freedom in Europe</em> gives you a quick overview of the challenges our community had to overcome and the successes we have achieved. The report will further concentrate on the FSFE&#39;s different areas of activities, our long-term goals and our achievements in the last twelve months.</p>
			
		<p>To help you navigating through the report, we grouped its content along <a href="/about/ourwork.html">the three pillars</a> of our activities: <strong>Policy Advocacy, Legal Support, and Public Awareness</strong>. We finish the report with insights in our activities, numbers from our merchandise and pr-departments, an introduction to our team members and our community, and an outlook into the next 12 months.</p>
		
		<p>Enjoy the read and if you are not a supporter yet, <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">consider supporting software freedom in Europe</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="trust">Enabling trust in a digital society</h2>

		<p>In the recent months there have been a lot of changes and challenges for us: as you will read in this report many organisations made quick decisions and introduced proprietary software for their remote communication, there were almost no physical events happening to promote software freedom, and almost no opportunities during the year to spent social time together. I miss those times with you, receiving direct personal feedback for our work, building or enlarging the FSFE&#39;s network as well as nourishing personal friendships. It is way harder to work together remotely for our joint mission without those energetic moments in which we see each other in person. </p>
		
		<p>One other aspect that became apparent to me during the pandemic was how many people have lost or are losing confidence in democratic institutions and processes. One component of this lack of confidence in democracy is a lack of confidence in technology. And this lack of confidence is something where our work for Free Software can make a positive change. </p>
		
		<p>Technology is becoming more and more complex and it is more and more difficult to understand how it works. At the same time, technology is becoming increasingly important in more and more areas of our life. This leads to the fact that many decisions, rules and processes in our society are more opaque for a large part of the population and they lose confidence.</p>
			
		<p>As technology creators the Free Software community is in a debt to deliver towards our society. We must actively counter the loss of confidence caused by complex technology. We ourselves must actively break the <em>power of technical creators</em> and help people understand the meaning, purpose and function of technology and thus enable them to self-determined use technology.</p>
		
		<p>People must not resign themselves and think &quot;The computers do anyway what they want&quot;. We must give people confidence that no one is excluded from shaping technology. </p>
		
		<p>We have to talk about what rules are implemented through technology and whether these rules reflect the laws and social norms of our society -- and how we change technology if it violates our laws and social norms; in order to protect them.</p>
		
		<p>Everybody interested in helping citizen to trust the state must support such discussions and must not on the contrary, punish people for analyzing technology and discussing possible weaknesses and their potential negative impact on our society. If we do not make this possible, we nourish mistrust in technology, mistrust in society, mistrust of state institutions and distrust of our democracy. </p>
		
		<p>For better confidence in software, as one important component of technology, four aspects are necessary:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Confidence that digital tools are there for everyone, no matter what they were made for -- there must be no discrimination in the use of software.</li>
				<li>Confidence that everyone will be allowed to learn how the software works; which also requires the distribution of the source code. Access to the knowledge must not be artificially limited to a few selected.</li>
				<li>Confidence that other people may help me with the software and I am not on my own. </li>
				<li>Confidence that people will adapt the software to the needs of their family and friends. To those of an organisation, a company, an authority, or that of our society. Technology should be adapted to the people's needs and not people should have to adapt to technology.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<p>Software to be trusted must therefore allow to be used for any purpose, enabling studying and understanding, that it can be shared with others, and improved accordingly. This is what Free Software always ensures. And why Free Software is a crucial component to build confidence in the technologies that form our modern societies and the technologies that will do in the future.</p>
			
			<p>Success will depend on all of us. In order to regain confidence in a society with ubiquity of software, we have to demand the use of Free Software and support others in doing so. Developers and companies should publish their software as Free Software so they can be trusted. Public services, infrastructure und education must be build on the use and development of Free Software to strengthen democracy. </p>
			
			<p>Please read on to learn what the Free Software Foundation Europe contributed to our society during the last 12 month. I am proud to see what positive changes our contributors and staffers achieved despite the challenges we all faced. </p>
			
			<p>Wishing you all the best,<br />
			Matthias Kirschner - President Free Software Foundation Europe</p>



	<h2 id="distancing">Software freedom in times of physical distancing</h2>
	
		<p>The Outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus brought a lot of changes for most people and organisations around the globe and so for us. With physical distancing came the cancellation of Free Software conferences, our own events, and FSFE community meetings. However, <strong>booths and talks have always been one of the major channels over which we informed people about <a href="/freesoftware/index.html">Free Software</a> and <a href="/about/ourwork.html">the FSFE’s work</a></strong>. Losing these opportunities limits the visibility of our organisation and makes it harder to bring attention to the topics around software freedom in general.</p>
		
		<p>But physical distancing had much more impact. Many institutions, companies and administrations had to quickly build up digital infrastructure this year, to adjust to the global situation and enable remote working for their employees. While our community tried to help them with an overview about <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/FreeSoftware4RemoteWorking">good Free Software solutions for remote working</a>, many organisations made <a href="/news/2020/news-20200330-01.html">bad decisions in a rush</a> about their future digital infrastructure by choosing proprietary and unsustainable short-term solutions. </p>
		
			<h4 id="globalsolutions">Global problems need global solutions</h4>
		
		<p>On the other hand we also saw a lot of positive developments: Despite being cancelled, <strong>more and more Free Software events are now moving online and this helps to keep our communities strong</strong>. To some extent it evens lower the threshold of participation and gives new opportunities for people who might not have been able to participate in a physical event. Also the urgent need to create new software - be it for tracing abilities or for other urgent needs - opened windows of opportunity for us, that <strong>we successfully used to highlight the benefits of building public digital infrastructure on software freedom</strong>. </p>


			<figure>
				<a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/FreeSoftware4RemoteWorking"><img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/small/a36a5b25a13ccd7b1957445e675cd97a@2x.jpg" alt="Graphic of a person sitting in front of a computer, open air in the mountain-side." /></a>
			</figure>

		<p>The European Union and the World Health Organisation followed our arguments that <a href="/news/2020/news-20200408-01.html">global problems need global solutions</a> and why only Free Software can help us with this. Many Member states complied and <a href="/news/2020/news-20200402-02.html">published their Corona tracing apps as Free Software</a> and we managed to <a href="/news/2020/news-20200408-01.html">convince public hackathons</a> to publish any of their result under a Free Software license. Even on the hardware-side the FSFE was able to <a href="/news/2020/news-20200514-01.html">convince a dutch emergency ventilator project</a> towards using a free license.</p>

		<p>Still, the story is ongoing. The virus will keep having impact on our societies throughout all next year and potentially even longer. It will thus be important to keep explaining why short-term solutions are not good for our societies and <a href="/news/2020/news-20200330-01.html">how to ensure investing in freedom-respecting technologies</a>. </p>


	<h2 id="advocacy">Policy Advocacy</h2>
	
		<p>Political decisions and directions have big impact on Free Software, its ecosystems and its communities. The FSFE has long-time experience in working with policy-makers and public bodies in Europe, from local administrations to high-level decision makers. We are always aiming at enhancing the rights of Free Software users and developers and abolishing barriers to Free Software adoption.  <em>(read more about our general work on <a href="/about/ourwork.html#policy">policy advocacy</a>)</em></p>
		
	<h2 id="europeanpolicies">About the state of Free Software in European Public Policies</h2>
	
		<p>2020 has been a good part on our path to freedom. As indicated in the chapter about <a href="#distancing">Corona and software freedom</a> this is not only, but partly true, for the manifold discussion around developing and releasing COVID-19 contact tracing apps. Because in this special moment our societies have experienced an unprecedented demand for the rapid introduction of a new tracing technology that should potentially be used by every single member of our societies. During all these discussion, we have never tired of pointing out that <a href="/news/2020/news-20200402-02.html">any valid, healthy and sustainable solution for such a technology can only be Free Software</a>. In the weeks to follow, many national and European agencies and administrations followed our arguments and publicly declared  that <strong>any tracing app has to be published as Free Software</strong>. EU member states, supported by the European Commission, released a &quot;Common EU Toolbox for Member States&quot; in which they were asking to <strong>&quot;openly publish the technical specifications and the source code for the apps, as a way to maximise re-use, interoperability, auditability and security&quot;</strong>. </p>
		
		<p>Besides the pure fact that European Member States used public money to publish Free Software to help tackle the crisis, <strong>the positive effect of the corresponding discussions, publications and decisions is priceless</strong>. Major international and national news agencies have reported about health care apps becoming Free Software and the benefits involved. In several countries we have seen a coalition of scientists, data protection agencies, ministries and politicians who argued in favor of software freedom. Every time they do, more people are understanding why software freedom matters for our society. And every time more people are understanding the importance of software freedom, it is likely that some of them join our cause. </p>
		
		<p>These good signals go hand in hand with <strong>a year in that many administrations and political bodies have announced that they plan to follow our road to freedom</strong>. Starting at the end of last year with the biggest conservative party in Europe, the German CDU who <a href="/news/2019/news-20191125-01.html">resolved to join FSFE in demanding that software developed with public money should be publicly available as Free  Software</a>, many more followed. <a href="/news/2020/news-20200630-01.html">Munich commits to &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot;</a>, the <a href="/news/2020/news-20200424-01.html">Netherlands commit to Free Software by default</a>, <a href="/news/2020/news-20200610-01.html">Hamburg wants to focus more on Free Software</a>, and the Spanish Municipality of <a href="/news/nl/nl-202007.html#-dinero-p-blico-c-digo-p-blico-">Benigànim signed our Open Letter of our &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; campaign</a> .</p>

			</figure>
			
		<p>These are just some of the highlights on our road to freedom in 2020. And while we still have a lot to do, it is important and encouraging for us and our mission to see what we can and what we did achieve. Continue to read below about our other policy achievements in the last 12 months, sorted by topics.</p>


	<h2 id="publiccode">European public code</h2>
	
		<p>&quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; is the ongoing campaign of the FSFE that has achieved multiple milestones in its now three years of existence. More than 190 organisation and over 29.000 individuals signed <a href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">our open letter</a> demanding that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly available under a Free Software licence. Part of the campaign is a <a href="https://peertube.social/videos/watch/0bfce6d3-814f-43f6-aba9-071261ad70b3">professional video</a> and an expert policy-brochure, <a href="/news/2020/news-20200310-01.html">translated into multiple languages</a>. </p>
		
			<h4 id="conservativeparty">Biggest conservative party in Europe demand public code</h4>
		
		<p><strong>Ever since the &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; campaign has had a big influence on political bodies in Europe</strong>. Consequentially, in the last 12 months, we saw many articles and references about public code and more and more organisations supporting our demand or directly signing our open letter. One of the highlights - as already mentioned in the article about the <a href="#europeanpolicies">State of Free Software in European Public Policies</a> - is the impact on the biggest conservative party in Europe, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU).  The CDU <a href="/news/2019/news-20191125-01.html">updated their party convention</a> to now include the demand that software developed with public money should be publicly available as Free Software. Another highlight was to see Munich rethinking and <a href="/news/2020/news-20200506-01.html">committing themselves back towards software freedom</a> by supporting our demand for public code. To help them keep their promise, we keep watching their political activities and after 100 days we <a href="/news/2020/news-20200810-01.html">published a first evaluation</a> on Munich&#39;s developments. </p>
		
			<h4 id="onerepository">Knowledge exchange and common code repository</h4>
		
		<p>Driven by so much positive feedback, <strong>we continue to encourage discussions between public administrations and institutions and the exchange of best practices</strong> - technical, organisational and juridical - related to the publication of code. To this effect, in May this year we had been planning to organise the <a href="https://registration.fsfe.org/Digitale-Verwaltung-2020">first of its kind conference</a> tackling the various aspects surrounding public code and digital sovereignty. Unfortunately, as so many other events this year, the conference had to be cancelled. But the high demand on our tickets and the high-level expertise among the participants who registered for the event demonstrates once more the huge interest in publicly funded code and its importance for our society.</p>
		
		<p><strong>The continuing interest in our <em>#publiccode</em> campaign beyond party lines and sectors just recently culminated in a new alliance of administrations, business and civil society organisations</strong>, who <a href="/news/2020/news-20200910-01.html">call for the development of one common code repository</a> for Free Software developed by the public sector. Under the slogan <em>&quot;A place for public code&quot;</em>, this interest group now wants to pave the way for a portal through which any public administration in Germany can exchange and jointly develop Free Software in an adequate and legally compliant manner. </p>

	<h3 id="routerfreedom">User&#39;s freedom starts from your router</h3>
	
		<p><strong>Since 2013, the FSFE has been advocating for <a href="/activities/routers/index.html">Router Freedom in Europe</a></strong> with outstanding results in Germany and with positive influence across Europe. In 2020 our long-term commitment has been extremely helpful, because a new set of rules comes into play regarding Router Freedom,  the new <em>Guidelines on the Location of the Network Termination Point</em>. Drafted by the  Board of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC), these new regulatory rules threaten the fundamental rights of end-users to choose their own routers and modems. We immediately took stand to protect user&#39;s freedom and started to balance the discussion with our <a href="/news/2019/news-20191120-01.html">input on the guidelines for Router Freedom in Europe</a>. </p>


			<figure>
				<a href="/activities/routers/index.html"><img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/big/f0bb57b6899e3429728de5051c7b0f44.png" alt="A graphic to explain router freedom." /></a>
			</figure>
			
			
			
		<p>Meanwhile, BEREC has <a href="/news/2020/news-20200601-01.html">published the result of the public consultation</a>. Within this publication, BEREC luckily sided with <strong>the FSFE&#39;s demand that any router and modem are under the full control of the user, who can freely decide which device to use</strong> - not in control of the Internet Service Providers (ISP).  Most important, BEREC modified the official text in order to explicitly adopt our position that Router Freedom should be the rule when determining the <em>Network Termination Point</em>. BEREC also explicitly recognised a lot of other arguments we brought into the discussion in favour of real Router Freedom - from net neutrality to end-users&#39; digital sovereignty to improved innovation and competition.</p>
		
			<h4 id="nationalregulations">European guidelines facing national regulations</h4>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, the new guidelines from BEREC still grant the different National Regulatory Agencies the discretionary power to restrict Router Freedom if they decide that there is an <em>&quot;objective technological necessity&quot;</em> for routers to be part of the ISP&#39;s network. That is why the FSFE complemented the BEREC&#39;s finding with a report on <a href="/news/2020/news-20200601-01.html">the challenges Router Freedom might expect with the new regulatory patchwork in Europe</a>. Vague terms of the BEREC Guidelines, the lack of commitment by National Regulatory Agencies and the abusive behaviour of ISPs will impose several obstacles for users to have their rights assured in Europe. Hence, <strong>the FSFE will closely monitor national activities and compliance</strong>. Because despite all the successes we had, real Router Freedom is still not in place in many Member States. <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">Support us with a donation</a> to help us monitoring the activities of the National Regulatory Agencies and increasing awareness across Europe in favor of users&#39; freedom. </p>

		<p>On a side-note: we also published <a href="/news/2020/news-20200302-01.html">direct experience</a> of FSFE staffers facing various hard and soft barriers that Internet Service Provider might impose to consumers, their routers, and modems - contradicting Router Freedom. In the same report, though, you read about strategies you can take against such violations, including reporting these issues to national regulators and consumer protection authorities.</p>


	<h2 id="legal">Legal Support</h2>
	
		<p>Free licenses and their proper application can be complex but are indispensable for Free Software. At the Free Software Foundation Europe, <a href="/freesoftware/legal/legal.html">we educate people on these legal issues</a> and help developers, companies and political entities to develop, use and reuse Free Software in a manner that is compliant with existing legal frameworks.  <em>(read more about our general work on <a href="/about/ourwork.html#legal">legal support</a>)</em></p>


	
	<h3 id="reuse">REUSE being used</h3>
	
		<p>For many developers, licensing and copyright is an annoying but necessary burden. <strong>It is important that developers communicate the conditions and the authorship for their code clearly so that re-users are aware of them.</strong> And the other way round, it is just fair to respect other developers&#39; licensing choices. But doing all of that without any guidelines is hard and often creates more uncertainty. That is why with our <a href="https://reuse.software">REUSE</a> initiative, we aim to facilitate the whole process and provide simple best practices and accompanying tools for machine-readable licensing.</p>


			<figure>

			</figure>

		
			<h4 id="adoptions">Early adopters and large migrations alike</h4>

		<p>After the <a href="/news/2019/news-20190807-01.html">release of the most recent version 3.0</a> of these guidelines, we have been focusing on supporting Free Software projects in adopting the underlying best practices – with success! More than 150 projects that we are reviewing in the scope of <a href="#ngi0">our NGI0 involvement</a> are in process of adopting our REUSE specifications and many of them are are already REUSE compliant. But our REUSE practices are not only interesting for new projects. <strong>One of the biggest and oldest Free Software projects, the well-known KDE community, recently <a href="https://community.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy#License_Statements">included REUSE in their licensing policy</a></strong> and they already <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/reuse/2020q3/000095.html">migrated all their frameworks</a> to the recommended standard.</p>

		<p>And this is just the start. Continuously spreading the word about easy compliance and having more software projects following the REUSE best practices is among our top priorities. To ease that process and further attract compliance, <strong>we are constantly enhancing the provided tooling with more features and additional automation</strong>. In addition we are working on updating the specifications to allow for more flexibility and compatibility. If you are interested now in supporting these goals, you are very welcome to contribute to the <a href="https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/">tools and documents we provide</a> and join the <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/reuse">dedicated mailing list</a> to participate in the project discussions.</p>

	<h3 id="ngi0">NGI0: Passing on what we learned about licensing</h3>
	
		<p>The FSFE is part of a consortium of organisations <a href="/news/2019/news-20191022-01.html#ngi0">collectively known as Next Generation Internet Zero (NGI0)</a>, which in turn is part of an initiative of the European Commission to support fundamental rights enhancing technologies in the Internet. </p>
		
		<p>In our role as a consortium member, <strong>the FSFE&#39; legal team assists all participating software projects with any Free Software copyright and licensing issues that they may run into</strong>. Also we are steadily working through reviewing the repositories of meanwhile over 200 Free Software projects for license compliance, and we are encouraging and assisting them with becoming <a href="#reuse-being-used">REUSE compliant</a>. So far, we have managed to review almost 100 projects, and working with many of these projects to help them become REUSE compliant has been a very positive experience. Just recently, the NGI0 Consortium&#39;s periodic report for the first year of our activities was reviewed by the European Commission, and was very well received. </p>

		<p>In addition, together with our NGI0 partner organization [ifrOSS (the Institute for Legal Issues Regarding Free and Open Source Software] (<a href="https://www.ifross.org/">https://www.ifross.org/</a>), we have put together a series of <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/NGI0/V2/">FAQ documents for NGI0</a> on basic Free Software legal and licensing issues. These documents are provided to <strong>help projects understand underlying legal issues and how to contribute towards building a better Free Software licensing ecosystem</strong> in the long run. However, these FAQs are not only available for software projects participating in NGI0, but for general knowledge sharing and the general public as well.

		<p>The FSFE participated in multiple consultations run by the European Commission covering legal and economic aspects of Free Software. In <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12325-Evaluation-of-the-Commission-Notice-on-market-definition-in-EU-competition-law/F519118">our feedback on &quot;EU competition law – market definition notice&quot;</a>, the FSFE advised to increase <em>&quot;the Commission&#39;s active role in leveraging the experience of smaller stakeholders who can provide in-depth expertise in specific fields of the software industry or which have critical views on the impact that digital technologies have over competition&quot;</em>. In this regard, we have <a href="/news/2020/news-20200519-01.html">highlighted</a> the necessity to better obtain feedback from smaller organisations and civil society in topics of competition law. Furthermore, <strong>the FSFE has collaborated with the Commission in top antitrust cases</strong>, providing a substantial contribution in the defence of landmark decisions that have shaped competition case law, both in court and in the public outreach fora.</p>

			  <em>"I'm very impressed with what the FSFE has achieved on the EU and national level. Back when I was working in the public sector I was able to glimpse the vast amounts of money that are thrown at lobbying for proprietary software and so called industry standards in Germany and the EU. It's astonishing how the FSFE has still managed to get itself heard. That is one of the reasons why I'm supporting the FSFE. "</em>

		<p>We published <a href="/news/2020/news-20200820-01.html">our feedback on the Commission&#39;s <em>&quot;Intellectual Property Strategic Plan&quot;</em></a>, stressing the danger of the expansion of copyrights, patents and trade secrets.  The FSFE explained that <strong>expanding the scope of protection of such monopolies does not lead to innovation, competition and progress</strong>. Instead, the effect of increasing patentable or copyrightable matter could be increasing unfairness, with innovation prevented by limited access to improvements of know-how and economic stagnation. Besides that, the FSFE urged the Commission to question the outdated notion of <em>&quot;intellectual property&quot;</em>, which is an ideologically charged term and dangerously oblivious to the significant differences that exist between the many areas of law that it tries to subsume.</p>

			  <em>"When I read the term "Intellectual Property" I always suspected it to be a "contradictio in adiecto", because only something physical can be possessed, intellectual ideas can not. To get the best benefit out of ideas for all, they should be spread as wide as possible and with as few restrictions as possible. The GNU General Public License seems to be a good example for such little restriction, especially the inheritance principle prevents possible misuse of the idea about Free Software. Following these ideas in an ethical way, for me the FSFE seems to be the very best NGO to be found. And so I support them. And I only found kind people here. "</em>

	<h3 id="licensingquestions">Our department for licensing questions</h3>

		<p>Besides official campaigns and consultations, <strong>the FSFE runs a department for Licensing Questions</strong> (<a href="mailto:licence-questions@lists.fsfe.org">contact</a>), composed by several volunteer legal experts from around Europe that continuously help projects and individuals with topics concerning Free Software licensing. In 2020 the group has dealt with inquiries related to potential licensing violations, hardware licenses, as well as compliance questions regarding the Corona tracing app in Germany. </p>



	<h2 id="publicawareness">Public Awareness</h2>
	
		<p>Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives. It is important that people and organisations know about software freedom and its benefits for our society so they can join our cause. The more people who understand Free Software, the stronger our voice becomes and the more we will accomplish for software freedom. That is why a main focus of the FSFE&#39;s work revolves around informing the public. <em>(read more about our general work on <a href="/about/ourwork.html#awareness">public awareness</a>)</em></p>

	<p>Any list of local FSFE community projects can only be exemplary, since <strong>the FSFE builts its success on the shoulders of a diverse community spread over Europe</strong>. Together we support each other in our work with formal and informal meetings and networks, with sharing information and knowledge, and with spreading the word and setting up information booths. </p>

		<p>Some of us meet in local groups and use the chance for example to organise local events like cryptoparties or public debates. Others create public awareness for example by printing <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/action/show/LocalGroups/RheinMain?action=show&amp;redirect=LocalGroups%2FFrankfurt#Freie_Software_Hand-Outs">their own leaflets</a> or by creating a particular web-presence in support of software freedom. We summarize these activities as local community projects and <strong>we understand these activities as a core-concept of our volunteer-driven organisation</strong>. </p>
		<p>To further facilitate local projects and to give everyone quick and easy support in their ideas, we recently introduced a <a href="/news/2020/news-20200907-01.html">regular call to apply for FSFE support for your local project</a>. <strong> Applying is easy and we happily support you with our expertise, our information material, our networks, or even financially</strong>.  Watch out for the next call and so long find some inspiration about our community projects hereafter - exemplary for all the other local activities in the last months.</p>

			<li>The local FSFE group Zurich created a website called <a href="https://lernenwiedieprofis.ch/">&quot;Learning like a pro&quot;</a> (original German: <em>&quot;Lernen wie die Profis&quot;</em>) which they use to explain why Free Software matters in education. It proceeds describing individual Free Software solutions and how these solutions in particular can be used to make school learning efficient and easy.</li>
			<li>Our french team organised a conference-debate (<a href="https://peertube.social/videos/watch/98b914c8-7185-435b-93ed-9e67f99b795f">video recording</a>) at Sciences Po Paris with some of the local candidates for the Mayor Elections in Paris, who are also digital specialists. </li>

		<h3 id="events">Events we organised and participated in</h3>
		
		<p>In between the time we have written the <a href="/news/2019/news-20191022-01.html">last Yearly report</a> back in October 2019 and this one, the spread of COVID-19 forced the cancellation of all physical events we have been preparing to participate or to run ourselves. So we split this chapter between the time we still have participated at physical events and the time thereafter.</p>
		
			<h4 id="last-physical-meetings">Last physical meetings</h4>
			
		<p>From November 15 to 16 in 2019 we were running the yearly <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/FSFECommunityMeeting2019">FSFE Community Meeting</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.sfscon.it/">SFSCon</a>. It was composed of social meetups, breakout-sessions, future-plannings and an official track organised by the FSFE. German deputy coordinator Florian Snow <a href="/news/2019/news-20191205-01.html">wrote a report</a> afterwards to reflect the feeling and the good vibe we had, including links to the slides and videos of most of the presentations.</p>

		<p>At the end of 2019 the FSFE participated in the Cluster <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Assembly:About:freedom">about:freedom</a>, an on-site gathering at the 36th Chaos Communication Congress, composed of 12 civil society organisations and groups. In this position, <a href="/news/2020/news-20200121-01.html">we organised 19 self-organised sessions during the 4 days</a> on various stages with additional concerts in the night and public Free Software Sing along sessions - among other activities.</p>

		<p>We started the year 2020 with our pre-FOSDEM event in Brussels. The event was kicked off by a presentation from Marcel Kolaja, Vice President of the European Parliament, which was then followed by insights and presentations from diverse Free Software organisations from all over Europe - from Albania to Greece to Portugal. Among the participants have been the leaders and representatives of several Free Software organisations and initiatives around Europe and many volunteers from our community. </p>
		
		<p><a href="/news/nl/nl-202002.html#fsfe-pre-and-post-fosdem">This pre-event was followed by a strong all-around presence at FOSDEM itself</a> with many talks from our community about the latest issues regarding FSFE and software freedom. Our infobooth was in great demand and our highly motivated team put smiles on many faces. We finally completed our presence with social evenings for our community on Saturday and Sunday night</p>

		<h4 id="meetings-go-online">Meetings go online</h4>
		
		<p>Our last physical meeting before the shutdown in basically all European Member States was <a href="https://mehl.mx/blog/2020/system-hackers-meeting-lyon-edition/">the FSFE&#39;s system hackers meetings in Lyon</a>. The System Hackers are the team who is responsible for the maintenance and development of a large number of FSFE&#39;s infrastructure and services. <a href="/activities/ln/llw.html">The FSFE&#39;s Legal and Licensing Workshop</a> on the contrary, was the first event that <a href="/news/2020/news-20200415-01.html">had to be cancelled</a> due to the COVID-19 outbreak. In the meantime we have started reorganizing the conference into a continuing series of online presentations and discussions that take place on average of once a month.</p>
		
		<p>More and more FSFE events had to be cancelled throughout the years. From the one we organise ourselves we had to cancel our <a href="https://registration.fsfe.org/Digitale-Verwaltung-2020">Conference on Digital Sovereignty</a> and our yearly community meeting. And of course, countless events that where we were planning to participate in, give talks at, and host information booths have been cancelled. In fact these cancellations bring a big financial impact for the FSFE because booths and talks have been some of the main channels over which we inform people about software freedom and the FSFE’s work. Losing these due to cancellation of events also means a heavily limited visibility for our topics and our organisation. </p>


		<p><strong>Meanwhile many events are running online and <a href="/events/events.html">we are participating</a> in many of them again to help spread the word about software freedom</strong>. Still, the visibility and relevance of a booth where humans speak from face to face with each other and interested people can get to know the people behind the FSFE in real life is not similar in an online event. So, to keep the software freedom movement solid and alive, please <a href="/news/2020/news-20200411-01.html">consider donating a part of your conference budget to Free Software organisations, including the FSFE</a>.</p>



		<h3 id="podcast">Software Freedom Podcast</h3>
		
		<p>With the end of last year the FSFE started the regular bi-monthly <a href="/news/podcast.html">Software Freedom Podcast</a>. Katharina Nocun, Matthias Kirschner and Bonnie Mehring from <strong>the FSFE talk to experts from the Free Software community to discuss their work for Free Software or a related topic of their expertise</strong>. Offering these interviews as a podcast gives easy access for many people and enables outreaching our message into new audiences at the same time. With every episode we focus on one special topic to help sharing insights on that particular topic with our listeners.</p>
		
		<p>So far we had <a href="/news/podcast/episode-1.html">Cory Doctorow about DRM</a>, <a href="/news/podcast/episode-2.html">Lydia Pintscher about KDE</a>, <a href="/news/podcast/episode-3.html">Hard Welte about mobile freedom</a>, <a href="/news/podcast/episode-4.html">Carmen Bianca Bakker about REUSE</a>, <a href="/news/podcast/episode-5.html">Lawrence Lessig about regulation</a>, <a href="/news/podcast/episode-special-1.html">Falcón and Braun about GNU Health</a> and <a href="/news/podcast/episode-6.html">Miriam Ballhausen about Copyright enforcement</a>.  Last but not least, we recently published our seventh episode with <a href="/news/podcast/episode-7.html">Vincent Lequertier about artificial intelligence</a>. You can listen to the podcasts <a href="/news/podcast.html">directly on our website</a>. or <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/audio/podcast/">download</a> them  for later use.

		<h3 id="webpresence">New look and feel of our webpresence</h3>
		
		<p>We have been using the time of <a href="#events">cancelled events</a> to overhaul our web-presence into a new feel and look and, most important, an <strong>improved presentation of information and a better user experience</strong>. In this process we also have been running our first online web-a-thon. Most obvious for anyone is the complete new look on our <a href="/">front page</a>,  where all the up-to-date information we publish every week now also has the most prominent and visible spots. As a visitor, starting their adventure from the front-page it is also much easier now to navigate to any other information on our pages that you are looking for. </p>

		<p>We further took the chance to overwork existing content or to merge different spots of information into one. Some of the most interesting and important to many readers will probably be our pages on <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">general concepts aboutFree Software</a>as well as the pages of our <a href="/activities/activities.html">particular activities</a>. While the first one now is visually improved with the help of graphics from our <a href="/activities/publiccode/brochure.html">Public Money? Public Code! brochure</a>, the latter finally puts all our different activities into one page. While it still offers visitors at the same time an overview sorted by topic and relevance. </p>

		<p><strong>Many non-visible things have happened as well to further improve your online experience.</strong> One of these often hidden activities is the work of our <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/System-Hackers/">System Hackers</a>. This small team runs all the FSFE&#39;s digital infrastructure from our physical servers to virtual machines and individual services and it includes also the maintenance of it all. Since complexity grows with each new service and feature, the system hackers&#39; recent months were dominated by enhancing automation, harmonisation and resilience of our systems. For instance, they introduced a new monitoring system currently spanning 21 systems with 242 service checks they and are currently in the process of setting up two new server clusters.</p>
		
		<h3 id="spreadtheword">Spreading the word of software freedom</h3>
		
			<h4 id="promotion-material">Promotion Material</h4>
			
		<p>Besides the web-presence, <strong>the FSFE empowers users to promote digital freedom in the real world by offering a large set of promotion material</strong>. You can find inspiration about the <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword#100-freedoms-black-sticker">100 freedoms of Free Software</a> and why <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword#nocloud-sticker">There is no Cloud, just other people&#39;s computers</a>, or leaflets to help you explain <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword#freedom">Free Software</a>, <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword#gnupg-leaflet">Email encryption</a>, the dangers of <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword#drm-leaflet">DRM</a> and how to <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword#f-droid-leaflet">Free Your Android</a>. You can also find postcards, posters and stickers of our <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#pmpc">Public Money? Public Code!</a> and <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#ilovefs">I love Free Software campaign</a>. <a href="/order">Order your own material</a> now and help us to spread the word!</p>

			</figure>


		<p>New in our stock in 2020 are our <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword#multilanguage-free-software-logocolours">Free Software stickers in multiple languages and colours</a> and our <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword#hacking-100-freedom-sticker-blue">Hacking 0100 Freedom stickers with binary language in multiple colors</a></p>

			</figure>


		<p>In the last 12 months, we sent out 631 information material  orders around the world. This means <strong>literally thousands of stickers, leaflets, and posters have been given out to people, who are interested or who maybe hear about Free Software for the first time</strong>. If you would like to support us in this direct action, consider <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">supporting us financially or consider a donation</a> along with <a href="/order">your personal order of information material</a>. The right leaflet at the right time to the right person can be the start of long-lasting change.</p>
		
			<h4 id="merchandise">Merchandise</h4>
			
		<p><strong>In addition to our promotion material, we also offer you the chance to show your love for Free Software by using and wearing some of our <a href="/order/order.html">merchandise items</a></strong>. Free Software clothing is a great way of raising awareness within your local community, and each sale helps to fund critical FSFE projects. Especially now, since we have a serious downstream of revenue <a href="#events">by not being able to go to conferences</a> and sell merchandise.</p>
		
		<p>So we made a virtue out of necessity and decided to do an extra sale with our old material. The interest and success was overwhelming and we sold 316 shirts and 38 hoodies in seven days. In contrast, we sold another 290 t-shirts and 71 hoodies in the whole last 12 months. Most popular ever since is the <a href="/order#tshirt-nocloud-black">There is NO CLOUD</a> shirt, followed by our <a href="/order/#tshirt-100freedoms-black">100 Freedoms of Free Software</a>.</p>
		<p>But the hitlist of items can be challenged since we introduced a new multilingual t-shirt with that you can <a href="/order/#tshirt-multilingual-black">show your love for Free Software in 24 languages</a>! Support our work and <a href="/order/order.html">get your personal shirt today!</a></p>

		<h2 id="who">Who we are</h2>
		
		<p>It is no secret that even in the daily operations of the FSFE we rely on all the beloved people who help us continuously on different levels with their respective skills. <strong>It is only through working together with our community that the FSFE is able to form a movement across Europe to build a society based on users&#39; and software freedom</strong>. A society in where users are empowered to control their technology. </p>
		
			<h3 id="ourmovement">Our movement</h3>
			
		<p>In the last few years, we exceeded some ten thousand people from Europe and beyond who are supporting our cause by <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword">spreading our word</a>, signing our open letters, subscribing to our <a href="/contact/email-updates.html">community mails</a> and <a href="/news/newsletter.html">newsletter</a> or joining our <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/discussion">public discussions</a>. If you ever wondered who all these people are and how a FSFE supporter looks like, we created a dedicated <a href="/about/people/testimonials">testimonials page</a> for you, where many of our supporters left a quote, sometimes an interview and sometimes even a video. </p>

			<p><strong>Our staffers make sure to keep running the FSFE&#39;s administration and daily operations.</strong> From sending promotion material to donation receipts, from selling merchandise to organising our larger community events. But they also represent the FSFE officially in talks and presentations or in different kind of meetings. </p>
			
			<p>At the FSFE we currently employ <strong>five full-time staffers and three part-time employees</strong>. These are the President Matthias Kirschner, the policy advisor Alexander Sander, and Lucas Lasota with Gabriel Ku Wei Bin running our legal department. Max Mehl, Bonnie Mehring and Erik Albers support our community and technical teams and nothing would work without Francesca Indorato running our daily office operations. This permanent team has appreciated the help this year of our now former interns Bonnie Mehring and Erik Grun. As an attentive reader you might have recognized that Bonnie Mehring indeed joined our permanent staff after finishing her internship this year. In the time of writing we are eager to enlarge our team again and we are looking for an additional office assistant. Also we are always interested in <a href="/contribute/internship.html">internship applications</a>.</p>


			<p>All staffers are officially contracted with the FSFE as an association with charity status, registered in Germany. <strong>The charity is governed by its formal members</strong>, the (<a href="/about/team.html#general-assembly">&quot;General Assembly&quot;)</a>, who are responsible for planning, budgeting, setting the agenda, as well as electing and recalling the Executive Council and the Financial Officer. In the 2019 GA the FSFE&#39;s President Matthias Kirschner, Vice-President Heiki Löhmus and Financal Officer Patrick Ohnewein <a href="/news/2019/news-20191014-01.html">have been approved to run the FSFE for another 2-years term</a>.</p>
		
		<h3 id="transparency">Our transparency commitment</h3>
		
			<p>The FSFE supports the initiative of a <a href="https://www.transparency.de/Initiative-Transparente-Zivilg.1612.0.html">“transparent civil society”</a> with <a href="/about/transparency-commitment.html">our transparency commitment</a>. Besides our constitution and minutes from our general assemblies you find information to other general reports and about the connections that we have with other organisations. Of course you also find information on <a href="/about/funds/funds.html">how we use our money</a> and <a href="/donate/thankgnus.html">who are our donors</a>. </p>	
		
		<h2 id="outlook">Looking forward</h2>
		
		<p>The ongoing Corona crisis will bring more dramatic changes to our societies. We will see more steps to be taken in a rush towards digitizing essential infrastructures and services that future generations consequently have to built on. This is why it is upon us today to help ensure that our societies and any individual can stay in control of technology. </p>
		
		<p>The community and the movement around the Free Software Foundation Europe had outstanding success this year with channeling our demands to create global solutions under free licenses. Just as we had success to convince publicly funded hackathons to publish their results as Free Software.  But the journey continues and there is a lot more to do. <strong>We will keep raising our voice for true users freedom and help our societies to potentially overcome the crisis more free than we entered it.</strong></p>

		<p>On top level, EU President von der Leyen does not tire to promote a path for European digitisation that is innovative and carbon-neutral in one. On the way to reach this goal we will probably see a lot of investments in science, software and technologies that help tackle climate change. Most of the money invested will be public money and so we have to ensure that any such publicly spended money leads to public code as in Free Software as well. This should of course be the rule for any investements on national and local levels as well. </p>
		
		<p>Given the circumstances the FSFE will use the chance to offer more virtual community meetings. Be it for content-related teams and campaigns or for the social gathering, soon we will start a series of knowledge sharing and networking events in our own Big Blue Button instance. Of course, we will continue with our public awareness campaigns and our political advocacy, with providing our expertise, and with providing resources to enable everyone to further promote Free Software in Europe. If you like to stay up to date with our milestones, sign up for our <a href="/contact/email-updates.html">email updates</a>. </p>
		
		<p>Finally, we cannot be grateful enough and make this point often enough: <strong>All our work and successes during the last 12 months would not have been possible without our contributors and our financial supporters! Our big thank you to all of you!</strong></p>

		<p>And for those who like to support us but are still not doing it: To achieve our goals for the upcoming months we really need you: Please <a href="/contribute">contribute as a volunteer</a> or <a href="/donate">support us financially</a> to ensure that our message is heard in as many diverse parts of our society as possible.</p>
		
		<p>Future generations will be thankful. As we are already today!</p>
		
		<p><strong>Your Free Software Foundation Europe</strong></p>




		<h2 id="about">About the Free Software Foundation Europe</h2>

		<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is a <strong>charity that empowers people to control technology</strong> by enabling access to software and its source code. The rights to use, study, share, and improve this software are essential to guarantee equal participation in democracies of the 21st century.</p>


		<p>We work for a world in which everyone has access to the source code of the software that runs in the products we own, or that is essential to the public infrastructure and services of the society we live in. Access to this code should be embedded in a legal environment where people are able to change technologies in a way that fulfills their needs - individually or collectively. Therefore, <strong>any software that is used to run public infrastructure or is publicly financed has to be made publicly available</strong>.</p>

		<p>Our mission is:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>to help individuals and organisations to understand how Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination.</li>
				<li>to enhance users' rights by abolishing barriers to Free Software adoption.</li>
				<li>to encourage people to use and develop Free Software.</li>
				<li>to provide resources and enable everyone to further promote Free Software in Europe.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>To help people understand our message, we use public campaigns and political lobbying, we provide expertise in talks and personal meetings, we set up informational booths and organise events, we produce promotion material and explanatory videos. To achieve our goals, we base our work and form our movement with the help of our community and friends, who ensure that our message gets out and is heard in as many diverse parts of our society as possible. We work in a transparent and cooperative way.</p>
