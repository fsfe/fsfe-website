<p>Have you ever struggled to explain why software freedom is important
or why we should care about Free Software? Our story “<em><em>Ada &amp;
Zangemann – A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice
Cream”</em></em> has proven to be a powerful tool for promoting the
importance of controlling our technology, repairing our devices, and
tinkering with the hardware and software we use every day. You can now
share this animated movie with your friends, embed the video in your
website or blog, or spread it in your social media networks.</p>
<p>This illustrated story explains, in a simple yet entertaining way,
why it’s crucial for us, as users, to take control of our technology and
stop leaving it entirely in the hands of others. While it was originally
designed for children, its message resonates just as strongly with
adults, making it an effective resource for sparking conversations about
digital autonomy and empowerment.</p>


<p>Released as an Open Educational Resource, under a Creative Commons By
Share-Alike Licence, <em>Ada &amp; Zangemann: A Tale of Software,
Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream</em> describes the interaction of the
famous inventor Zangemann and Ada, an inquisitive girl who loves to tinker.
As Ada experiments with hardware and software, she realizes how crucial
it is for everyone to have control over technology. Since its release,
this story has inspired readings in schools, conferences, and events
across Europe. And now, with its adaptation into an animated film,
screenings are being organized, even in cinemas! </p>

<h3>Power of our community, despite not having Hollywood marketing
budgets</h3>

<p>Help us to make others aware of this story, a useful educational
resource for explaining the importance of the right to tinker and the
right to repair, as well as self-determination, collaboration, and
freedom of speech. Share the movie, currently available in English,
French, German, and <strong>now also in Spanish</strong>!
To access the film and download links, visit <a
href="https://ada.fsfe.org/movie">ada.fsfe.org/movie</a>. </p>

<p>So please don’t wait: send it to friends,
e-mail it to your co-workers, and share it online! Every person watching
the movie might be an active member of the movement for software
freedom in the future. </p>

<h3>Want to do more? Organize readings and screenings</h3>
<p>Would you like to spark children’s interest in STEM in general and
coding in particular? Would you like to talk with them about the
importance of software freedom? Then you can host a reading at your
local library, screen the film at your child's school, or organize a
workshop at a cultural center. For example, a school in Marbella read
the story in class, and students wrote letters to Zangemann; in another
event, children sketched their own invention ideas; and at several
gatherings, kids enjoyed home-made ice cream. Even more: you can gift
the book to your local library, so everyone can borrow and read this
tale! Let’s help even more people discover Ada’s story!</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://ada.fsfe.org/">ada.fsfe.org</a> for all the
resources you need to organize a reading, including posters, postcards,
and stickers, which we will send you for free! You will also find a
<a href="https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/ada-zangemann/src/branch/main/Presentations">presentation</a> to guide your reading and much more. </p>
<p>Ready to take action? Start planning your event today. Don’t forget
to share your experience with us! We’d love to see how Ada’s story comes
to life in your community! </p>
