        <title>&quot;What role did Free Software play during the corona crisis?&quot; talk in Vigo, Spanien</title>

    <body>
      <p>Alexander Sander, FSFE Policy Consultant will give a talk on &quot;What role did Free Software play during the corona crisis?&quot; The Corona crisis has made it clear to us which developments in digitisation we have missed in recent years. At the same time, there are also positive examples. Free software has become more and more of a topic and more and more administrations have understood the advantages it brings.</p>
      <p>Alexander will take a look at the developments of the past years and give an outlook on how we can better face future crises through the use of Free Software and what role governments, public bodies and administrations and the principle of “Public Money? Public Code!” play in this. The talk is in Spanish, everyone can attend, the event is free of cost, but you need to register.</p>
