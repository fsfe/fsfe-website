    <h1 class="n">I ♥  Free Software</h1>

    <p id="introduction">
      Valentines Day is a celebration of love and affection between
      intimate companions.  This year why not take the opportunity to
      show you care about the people and <a
        href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> that
      show you love all year round?  Here are our suggestions for making
      this February the fourteenth a very special day.
    </p>
    

    <h2>This time it's personal</h2> 
  
    <p>
      Behind every Free Software initiative and organisation are real,
      hard-working people.  Show them that you appreciate their work –
      it could make all the difference!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Send them a message thanking them for their work</li>
      <li>Buy your favourite project some chocolates</li>
			<li>Hug a developer (ask permission first!)</li>
      <li>Buy your favourite developer a drink</li>
      <li><a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/mk/?p=399">Send a book to your favourite contributor</a></li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Money can't buy you love...</h2> 
  
    <p>
      … But it can help to fight for your freedom.  Donate to a Free
      Software initiative to express your gratitude.  Organisations like
      FSFE <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">depend on your contribution</a>
      to continue their work.  Check out your favourite organisation and
      make a donation.  You can be sure they will love you back.
    </p>


    <h2>Show your love</h2>

      </li>
