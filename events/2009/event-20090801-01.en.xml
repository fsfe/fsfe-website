    <title>Fellowship meeting and KDE 4.3 release party in Stuttgart,
    Germany</title>
    <body>
      About a half year ago we had a joint event between KDE and the Fellowship
      of FSFE to celebrate the release of KDE 4.2. Because of the success of
      the event and the upcoming release of KDE 4.3 we decided to invite you
      again to a KDE release party and Fellowship meeting in Stuttgart.  We
      will meet on Saturday, 1. August at 19:00, Restaurant Wartburg
      Tol(l)eranz, Gutenbergstrasse 87, 70197
      Stuttgart. See <a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/groups/Stuttgart">here</a>
      (German) for more details.
