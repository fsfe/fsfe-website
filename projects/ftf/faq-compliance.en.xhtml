<p>This compliance checklist can help you avoid some of the common errors encountered when releasing code under the GNU GPL licence.</p>

<p>This is not legal advice. If you have doubts consult a legal advisor.</p>

<h3>Compliance Checklist</h3>



<ol>
<li>Make sure you are not using a standard boilerplate text claiming the software is the copyright of your company. This is not true if you include Free Software copyrighted by 3rd parties in the product.</li>
<li>Remember to include the written offer for the source code if you do not include the source code with the product.</li>
<li>Make sure you are distributing the correct version of the source code. The source code has to be exactly the same version as the executable (object) code actually shipped.</li>
<li>Make sure that you include the "scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable"; the tools required to compile and install the GPL licensed components.</li>
<li>Remember that it is not enough to link to the GPL licence text; you must include a verbatim copy.</li>
<li>Remember that it is not enough to include a download link to the source code instead than a written offer to ship the source code on a physical storage medium customarily used for information interchange.</li>
<li>Remember that if a software distribution makes code publicly available for download, linking to a licence text or source code on servers other than yours is only allowed for non-commercial distributions.</li>
