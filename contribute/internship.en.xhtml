    <h1>Internships</h1>

    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
        We are looking for interns to join our team. The internships take
        between four and twelve months. We are accepting applications
        at all times without a specific deadline.  FSFE operates in a
        lively environment of numerous volunteers from many countries
        and several full-time employees.
      </p>

    <p>
      Before starting with the details, a few words from former FSFE
      interns:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        FSFE is involved in the most important processes on how
        Information Society is being shaped, be it on a national,
        European, or on a global level. It's exciting to be part of
        these activities.  (<cite>Alexander Finkenberger</cite>)
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        FSFE is a stimulating environment to work in. There are few
        organisations where you can learn from so many perspectives in this
        international and interdisciplinary context. If you read my <a
        href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/hugo">blog</a> you can have a good overview
        of some things I've been working on. (<cite>Hugo Roy</cite>)
      </p>
