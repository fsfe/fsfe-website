        <title>'What Free Software and Free Seeds have in common' talk in Berlin, Germany</title>

    <body>
      <p>At first glance, software and seeds seem to have little in common. The former has only been part of the reality of our lives for a few decades, while seeds could almost be considered an anthropological constant and are inextricably linked to human history. This lecture is dedicated to the latest cultural phenomena of Free Software and Free Seeds and highlights commonalities between the two spheres.</p>
      <p>The event takes place on Thursday 23 June 7:00PM at the Environmental Education Center Nirgendwo. The lecture will be given by 'tunda' in German. Everyone is welcome to attend, participation is at no cost, no registration is needed.</p>
