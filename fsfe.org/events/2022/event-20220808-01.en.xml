        <title>Translators team meeting (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>The FSFE's Translators team is mainly responsible for translating information about Free Software on the FSFE's webpage into other languages. The FSFE's Translators team has been helping to make information about Free Software available to everyone by translating them to more languages and thereby reducing language barriers. </p>
      
      <p>At our second meeting we are happy to welcome new team members, learn about the webpreview tool and FSFE's git-instance and also play some fun games together. The meeting will take place on the 8th of August and begin at 7 o'clock till 9 o'clock (CEST). The link to the meeting will be shared on the translators mailing list (https://lists.fsfe.org/postorius/lists/translators.lists.fsfe.org). Everybody who is interested in translating is welcome!</p>
