    <h2>European Legal Network</h2>

    <p>
      We facilitate the <a href="network.html">European Legal
        Network</a>, a private network of legal professionals with over 200
      members across 27 countries and four continents.  Members share knowledge
      across national borders and cooperate to increase the availability of
      information related to best practice in Free Software licensing.
    </p>


    <h2>Special Interest Groups</h2>

    <p>
      We organize special interest groups to discuss topics like
      business processes and the supply chain, software patents and code
      management in the embedded industry.  These groups are designed to
      reduce misunderstandings, share knowledge and address aress where
      there is a lack of available guidance.
    </p> 


    <h2>Conferences</h2>

    <p>
      We host a yearly legal conference called the 'European Legal and
      Licensing Workshop' to discuss the current market situation and
      projected future for Free Software licenses.  The next European Legal
      and Licensing Workshop is scheduled to take place in Amsterdam, The
      Netherlands, on the 8th and 9th of April 2010.
