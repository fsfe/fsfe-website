    <p id="introduction">Free Software is software that guarantees a set of
    freedoms to its owner. It is "free" as in freedom not as in free beer.
    Also other names were developed, such as Libre Software, Open Source,
    FOSS, FLOSS... At the FSFE, <a
      href="http://www.fsfe.org/documents/whyfs.en.html">we prefer to speak
      about "Free Software"</a> because this terms reflects better the
    underlying philosophy of the <a
      href="http://www.fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html">four
      freedoms of Free Software</a>.</p>
    
    <p>The Free Software movement was originated by Richard Stallman in 1983
    when he inaugurated the <a
      href="http://www.fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/gnuproject.en.html">GNU
      project</a>. It was based on the idea that the user shall be empowered to
    have full control over the software s/he had bought, and for this s/he
    needed between other things to have access to the <a
      href="http://www.fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/sourcecode.en.html">source
      code</a>. Further than the sole work on software, the struggle for the
    adoption of free software has been extended to the adoption of laws on <a
      href="http://www.fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/openstandard.en.html">open
      standards</a>.</p>
