      <p class="infodescription">
         Every year, 1.5 billion smartphones are manufactured worldwide - and probably just as many are thrown away. Most of them after way too short usage times. E-waste increases every year. The production of devices requires a lot of energy and natural resources. With Upcycling Android we try to fix that problem - for Android devices in particular!</p>

      <p>Our video explains the problem in a nutshell and shows how to overcome software obsolescence and help saving the climate in one. Enjoy and share it with your friends! Watch it <a href="https://peertube.social/videos/watch/b903289f-f0a6-4397-a9dc-945b948c993b">on Peertube</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqSEdTV9tb8">on Youtube</a></p>

      <p class="infodescription">
         The study starts with definition of software sustainability and its characteristics. It is shown how the inherent characteristics of Free Software are sustainable as well as their impact on IT infrastructures. Software obsolescence is explained and the possibilities of using Free Software to save natural resources by extending hardware usage lifetime and through energy consumption savings. Finally, five politically necessary directives for a more sustainable digital society are outlined. Read the <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">full study</a>.
