	Dear Zangemann,<br />
	Iâ€™ve been admiring you for years but now I realise what a selfish jerk you are.<br />
        You should share your inventions with others.<br />
        You should also stop controlling other people.<br />
        Because you have so much money you should share it with others and donate to charity.<br />
        Finally, I think that other people copying you is actually a good thing because it means people like your ideas.
