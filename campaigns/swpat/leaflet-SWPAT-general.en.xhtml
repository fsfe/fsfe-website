    <h1>A future without software patents</h1>

    <p class="background">
      Software patents threaten users' freedom. They create legal and
      financial risks that make it more difficult to develop and
      distribute software. They harm innovation and hinder healthy
      competition in the software market. 
    </p>

	<h2>What are software patents?</h2>

    <p>
      Patents are monopoly rights, granted by the state to the creator
      of a technical invention. When applied to software, patents give
      the company that holds them the right to block anyone from
      implementing a similar solution. Unlike copyright, patents do
      not restrict the use of an expression or the code
      itself. Instead, patents restrict the use of certain ideas - in
      case of software these ideas consist of algorithms and
      mathematics.
    </p>

	<h2>Bad for competition, bad for innovation</h2>
    
    <p>
      A large number of academic studies have shown that software
      patents are useless at encouraging innovation. They make it
      difficult for developers to write and market new programs which
      compete with existing ones. Software innovation is incremental,
      as new ideas build on older ones. If an old idea is blocked by a
      patent, then programmers cannot use it as a basis for their
      fresh ideas.       
    </p>

    <p>
      Patents are different from copyright, and arguably more
      harmful. Copyright merely gives authors a monopoly on a specific
      work, such as a text or a program. Patents give their owners a
      monopoly on all programs that use a given idea.
    </p>



	<h2>Patents encourage monopolies</h2>

    <p>
      Most patents in the IT world are held by large companies that
      have been in the market for a long time. Patents, which are
      expensive to file, maintain, and litigate, give them a powerful
      weapon against developers and companies that pose a threat to
      their market power, in both Free and proprietary software.
    </p>


	<h2>Status quo in Europe</h2>
    
    <p>
     The European Patent Convention says that "programs for computers"
     cannot be patented. Despite this, the European Patent Office
     (EPO) has developed a doctrine saying that "computer implemented
     inventions" can be patented, and has issued possibly tens of
     thousands of patents on software. Due to the diversity of
     Europe's jurisdictions, enforcing these patents was so difficult
     that it was almost never done. This protected Free Software
     developers in Europe from the patent system's worst excesses.
    </p>
    
    <p>
     Under extraordinary pressure from the Free Software community,
     the European Parliament in 2005 rejected the software patent
     directive, which would have allowed patents on computer programs
     outright. Since then, efforts to make software patentable have
     shifted towards creating a "unitary patent" system for
     Europe. Under this system, the EPO would have greater
     independence to implement its patent-maximalist doctrine. The
     unitary patent system is also meant to make it easier to enforce
     patents. This raises the threat level for Free Software
     developers considerably.
    </p>





	<h2>How FSFE fights software patents</h2>

	<p>
	FSFE's goal is to abolish patents on software once and for
	all. This will take a lot of time, and a lot of hard
	work. Until we achieve this goal, we are working to limit the
	risks that patents pose for Free Software developers. We raise
	awareness for the harm which software patents cause with
	policy makers and businesses. We are shaping public policy at
	all levels to limit the impact of patents on software. We
	educate regulators in dealing with patent-based threats to
	competition, and are closely monitoring how the implementation
	of the unitary patent system in Europe affects software
	developers.
