	<title>FSFE at FOSDEM 2021</title>
</head>

<body>

		<h1>FSFE at FOSDEM 2021</h1>
		
		<p>FOSDEM, the biggest annual Free Software event in Europe, took place again this year on the first weekend in February. 
		As every year, we organised a community event before FOSDEM and this year we also co-organised the Legal and Policy Devroom for the first time.</p>
		
		<p>While FOSDEM normally occurs every year in the Free University of Brussels, this year it happened online for the first time - and completely 
		with Free Software. FOSDEM had more than 25 simultaneous talks at times, with accompanying interactive text-based chat rooms, live Q&amp;A with the 
		speakers on video, and “hallway track” breakout rooms after each talk where speakers and attendees could join video chat together and discuss the talk. 
		According to the main FOSDEM organisers, they had a <a href="https://nitter.nixnet.services/_ShinIce/status/1358461185537044488">peak of 33,600 attendees</a>. 
		This year, FSFE is also honoured to have co-organised the Legal and Policy Devroom at FOSDEM for the first time. And like every year, we hosted a great 
		community event before FOSDEM, this time with a keynote from Cory Doctorow. </p>

		<h2>FSFE PRE-FOSDEM Community Event</h2>		
		
		<p>We started this years FOSDEM with a social meeting on Friday evening. Cory Doctorow gave a keynote for our FSFE PRE-FOSDEM community event on 
		internet monopolies and software freedom - a lecture you should not miss.</p>

		<h2>FOSDEM21: Legal and Policy Devroom agenda</h2>
		
		<p>FOSDEM's Legal and Policy Issues Devroom addresses important Free Software related policy or legal topics. Our community has substantial 
		expertise in this area, yet there are few venues to discuss these matters in a forum open to all. Hackers, developers, contributors, lawyers, 
		policy experts, and community leaders all possess expertise in these matters.</p>
		
		<p>Together with our co-organisers Karen Sandler and Bradley Kuhn from Software Freedom Conservancy, and Richard Fontana from Red Hat, 
		we discussed at the final panel the most important issues of the dev room and also tackled some topics that have been missing on the agenda. 
		This might be a good first video for you to get an overview of our devroom.</p>

		<h2>Free Software strategy of the Commission</h2>
		
		<p>On 21 October 2020, the European Commission approved their new "Open Source Software Strategy 2020-2023" of the Commission. We had an 
		interview with Evangelos Tsavalopoulos from the European Commission on this. In the interview we asked important questions about this strategy 
		and also addressed pressuring questions by our community.</p>

		<h2>Router Freedom</h2>
		
		<p>FSFE’s Deputy Legal Coordinator, Lucas Lasota, presented an overview on the current state of router freedom in Europe. New rules on EU has created 
		challenges router freedom, given that IAPs will be able to limit the right based on "objective technological necessity". The talk will go through 
		the historical aspects and future developments in Europe, why Free Software is a fundamental enabling element, and how people can get involved.</p>

		    <h2>Health public policy</h2>
        
        <p>In a panel moderated by Karen Sandler on Software and Hardware Freedom in health public policy, Fabio Balli, Adriana Groh and Luis Falcon discussed
        the extent to which the use of Free Software and open hardware can be used in the public health sector. The Corona crisis has clearly shown us that 
        we also need to work together in the area of software and hardware. For example Hackathons were held in various countries to find software solutions 
        to counter this crisis. The development of tracing apps or solutions for hospitals and health authorities has also shown that Free Software can help many 
        people and that isolated solutions are counterproductive. The panel discussed what lessons we can learn from the crisis and how Free Software and Open 
        Hardware must be used in the future. </p>

        <h2>Funding for Free Software projects</h2>
        
        <p>In a talk by Sven Franck the question of funding for Free Software projects was addressed. He demands to give Free Software a tax break. 
        He presented several initiatives from the Libre Endowment Fund ("Fonds de Dotation du Libre" in French) - from financing feature development of 
        Free Software to releasing a 4G/5G base station as open hardware or supporting litigation against the French government's decision to host 
        Health Data on Microsoft servers.</p>

        <h2>Licencing and Compliance</h2>
        
        <p>We also addressed questions on licencing and compliance. Bradley M. Kuhn moderated a panel with John Sullivan, Miriam Ballhausen, 
        Davide Ricci and Eilís Ní Fhlannagáin on the question if present compliance practices assure software freedom for device users? Compliance 
        with Free Software licenses remains a perennial topic of discussion among policy makers in our community. However, little attention is 
        paid to the motivations why these licenses have specific requirements. Specifically, at least for copyleft licenses, the licenses seek to 
        bestow specific rights and freedoms to the users who receive the software integrated into the devices they use. This panel discussed the 
        challenges and importance of assuring downstream can actually utilize the compliance artifacts they receive with products as intended by the license.</p>

        <p>A talk by Cornelius Schumacher from KDE addressed how a large community and a company worked together in terms of licensing: "Protecting 
        against proprietary re-licensing with a community contract - How the KDE Free Qt Foundation ensures software freedom for twenty-five years 
        and counting". This presentation will explain the community contract, how it augments the dual-licensing model, and how it has evolved and 
        served its purpose for 25 years and counting. It will also discuss the lessons learned and how it can serve as a model for other organisations.</p>

        </video>
        
        <p>And Giovanni Battista Gallus, Fabio Pietrosanti, Carlo Piana and Alberto Pianon discussed the first AGPL compliance case settled in an Italian Court. 
        Globaleaks is an AGPLv3+ SaaS application for anonymous whistleblowing, developed by the Hermes Center. After receiving a prototype, the Italian Anticorruption 
        authority (ANAC) re-published a version under EUPL, modifying attribution &amp; copyright statement, removing reasonable notice from GUI, and failing to fully 
        comply with source code obligations. After several attempts for an off-court solution, the question was finally settled by the parties, restoring the correct 
        license, and the other issues. There are several lessons to be learned by this controversy. License compatibility and the other Free Software obligations 
        (including conveying the corresponding source code) are not to be taken lightly, and require a good degree of knowledge and expertise, especially when 
        they are related to an application which has been implemented by several public administrations. </p>

        </video>
        
        <h2>Digital Markets Act</h2>
        
        <p>Also actual legislative proposals have been addressed. Vittorio Bertola gave a  talk on Free Software, Interoperability and the Digital 
        Markets Act proposing new European regulation to open up the dominant platforms. The European Commission recently proposed new regulations 
        (DSA/DMA/DGA) to protect democracy and restore openness and competition. The talk will introduce them and their economic and political background; 
        it will then focus on a specific point, the requirement for dominant platforms to interoperate with third parties, though only in limited cases, 
        using messaging and social media as example. </p>

        </video>
        
        <h2>Free Software Culture</h2>
                
        <p>Deb Nicholson and Hong Phuc Dang asked if Free Software culture is too us-centric and argued why it should not be so. Free Software is made 
        up of a truly global community of tinkerers, collaborators, and innovators. In this conversation, Deb Nicholson and Hong Phuc Dang look at the 
        global state of Free Software policy and talk about why no particular country -- especially the US -- should be centered.</p>

        <h2>REUSE - make licensing easy for humans and machines alike</h2>
        
        <p>Beside the talks at the legal and policy devroom, our Programme Manager Max Mehl gave a talk on "REUSE - Best practices for declaring copyright 
        and licenses" at the OpenChain devroom. With three simple steps, REUSE makes adding and reading licensing and copyright information easy for both 
        humans and machines. This presentation will guide you through the REUSE best practices and shows how to make clear licensing simple.</p>
