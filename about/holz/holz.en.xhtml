    <h2>About Christian Holz</h2>
    
    <p>Christian Holz has been working in the IT and IT-related industries since 1989. Starting his own IT Service company while still in the German form 
    of a high-school, he supported local businesses in the move from typewriters and photocopy machines to PCs and desktop publishing and eventually
    built and managed basic networks for them. Fascinated by IT and what it can do for an organization, he went on to study business administration with 
    a strong focus on Information Systems and Software Development. Fresh out of university, he became the technical leader of a small Internet Startup
    called inTouch GmbH, which grew into a pan-European web-development and hosting company (then called Integra S.A. and Genuity Europe). From there 
    he moved on to join PricewaterhouseCoopers' IT/IT-Security advisory practice in Frankfurt and Philadelphia, managing projects and supporting clients
    in tasks ranging from penetration tests and code-reviews all the way to outsourcing and due-diligence work. </p>
    
    <p>Since 2006, Christian has been running his own company, Callowhill GmbH, providing IT and management consulting services. His largest clients included a global
    music publishing firm, where he started to understand the inner workings of copyrights and their related laws as well as a large pharmaceutical
    company that he has been supporting in various IT- and strategy-related projects.</p>
    
    <p>Christian joined the FSFE as its Executive Director in June 2009.</p>
