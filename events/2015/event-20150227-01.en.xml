        Fellows of the FSFE will have a vote for the seventh elections for FSFE's
        Fellowship representative. Every Fellow who is allowed to
        vote should have received an email from “FSFE Fellowship (CIVS poll supervisor)”
        with the subject “Poll: Fellowship elections 2015”. Please find all
        necessary information for you to vote inside this email.
        The winner of the election will be publicly announced on March 16 on
        FSFE's web page.

        This year, you can vote for three outstanding candidates (in reverse
        alphabetical order):
          Felix Stegerman,
          Max Mehl and
          Nicolas Dietrich.
