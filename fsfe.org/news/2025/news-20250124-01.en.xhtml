<h1>Router Freedom in Germany: A victory for consumers!</h1>

<p>
After a failed attempt by internet providers to exclude Router Freedom 
from fiber networks, the German regulator BNetzA has confirmed Router 
Freedom in the country. The FSFE, which has been pushing for this since 
2013, will continue to monitor implementation and compliance.

<p>Router Freedom is the right to choose and use the router or modem of 
your choice to connect to the Internet. Similar to freedom of 
choice regarding smartphones or other internet devices, Router Freedom 
is the hardware aspect of net neutrality. In 2013, the FSFE in 
cooperation with other organisations, <a 
href="/activities/routers/timeline.html">started to 
advocate for it in Germany</a>, pushing this agenda with decision 
makers, resulting in a law in 2016 safeguarding Router Freedom for 
end-users.</p>

<p>In the imminence of the 9th anniversary of the law which, in 2016, 
introduced Router Freedom in Germany, the German telecom regulator 
Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA) has <a 
href="https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Fachthemen/Telekommunikation/Unternehmenspflichten/Schnittstelle_netzabschluss/start.html"> 
successfully concluded a regulatory procedure </a>(DE) requested by an 
association of fiber network operators in Germany to exclude Router 
Freedom from fiber networks. The request, made in 2023, was based on a 
series of arguments including security of the network, cost of support, 
quality of service and interoperability issues.</p>

<h3>No technical necessity to limit Router Freedom in fiber 
networks</h3> <p>In September, 2023, the FSFE submitted a <a 
 href="/news/2023/news-20230915-01.html">detailed 
 position paper</a> debunking the arguments of the fiber operators. We called 
 on the regulator to dismiss the request, as no legal or technical 
 reason could support excluding Router Freedom from fiber. Indeed, 
 although the network operators have tried to pose fiber networks as a 
 special case, we have demonstrated that there is no objective 
 technological necessity to abolish Router Freedom. On the contrary, 
 Router Freedom for fiber represents freedom of choice, security, 
 consumer welfare, fair competition and sustainability.</p>

<p>The German regulator has analysed the case applying the <a 
href="/news/2020/news-20200601-01.html"> Guidelines proposed by BEREC, 
the association of the European telecom regulators,</a> on the 
location of the “Network Termination Point” (NTP). The Guidelines on 
the NTP allow national authorities to limit Router Freedom if 
an “objective technical necessity” could be established. The criteria 
for that included interoperability, security, simplicity of operation
and data protection factors. The German operators requested BNetzA to 
completely limit end-users possibility to choose their own routers or to 
separate the fiber optical terminal (ONT), so 
personal routers could be used only in “bridge mode”, which would also 
negatively impact consumer choice.</p>

<p>In its <a 
href="https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Fachthemen/Telekommunikation/Unternehmenspflichten/Schnittstelle_netzabschluss/bescheid.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3">comprehensive
decision</a> (DE), BNetzA rejected all the arguments brought forward by 
the telecom operators, explaining in detail why freedom of terminal 
equipment complies with each of the criteria required by 
BEREC. Among them, we highlight:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Overstated network security risks:</strong> BNetzA rebutted 
operators by demonstrating that past records have shown that 
operators’ proprietary devices were also vulnerable to security risks. Besides, 
no significant number of security disruptions could be found in all 
those nine years the law has been in force in Germany. Operators have 
been slow in providing security updates to the equipment they provide 
to end-users, so limiting Router Freedom would not improve avoiding 
vulnerabilities;</li>

<li><strong> Far-fetched disruptive scenarios:</strong> BNetzA 
questioned the far-reaching security scenarios posed by operators, 
pointing out a lack of objectivity in the reports. The disruptive 
assumptions made by the operators could not justify limiting Router Freedom;</li>

<li><strong>Fragile evidence against interoperability:</strong> BNetzA 
affirmed that it has received very few reports of disruptions due to 
connection of personal routers to the networks. There was one isolated 
case 
in 2016;</li>

<li><strong>Technological neutrality is necessary:</strong> The 
regulator reinforced a position taken by the German government in 2018 
about safeguarding technological neutrality in regulation. Since 
diverse types of routers and modems are available on the market, the 
legislation should not discriminate against specific types of 
technology. Only a technology-neutral approach guarantees the freedom 
of terminal devices stipulated by European law for the benefit of 
end-users.</li> 

</ul>

<h3>A victory for long-lasting civil society engagement</h3>

<p>The <a href="/activities/routers/timeline.html">FSFE's advocacy for 
Router Freedom started in 2013</a>, way before the German law enacting 
this right entered in force. In 2019, during the reform of the EU 
telecom law, we expanded our efforts to the European level, engaging 
with national and European regulators. Router Freedom has became a 
reality in diverse EU countries, including <a 
href="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/router-freedom-tracker_581123#4/53.12/18.37"> 
 Finland, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>In all these processes we engaged local communities, experts and 
decision makers to protect the rights of end-users. Community support 
was key for achieving such success. For instance, the FSFE conducted a 
two-year project among its communities to collect data about abuses by 
telecom operators and other difficulties related to Router Freedom. The 
overarching survey resulted in a <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230515-02.html">  comprehensive report published 
in 2023  </a>  demonstrating how internet providers still hamper 
consumer freedom of choice, exercise lock-in over internet equipment and 
promote proprietary devices.</p>

<p>All over Europe, end-users have manifested their support for our work 
towards improving egulatory policies safeguarding the right to choose 
and use routers and modems. More than 90% of the participants in our 
survey agreed Router Freedom is key for open internet, security and data 
protection, fair competition and digital sustainability.</p>

<h2>Help us expanding Router Freedom to other countries</h2>

<p>As Router Freedom represents the hardware layer of net neutrality, it is an important policy demand.</p>

  <figcaption>In this chart of types of connection and router 
  usage can be seen that, although the majority of DSL subscribers use 
  their own routers, those on fiber and coaxial connections are still 
  dependent on providers’ equipment.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Differently from Germany, Router Freedom is still not a reality in 
several EU countries. The regulatory framework remains fragmented with 
countries like <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20231201-01.html">Austria and 
France, which decided to abolish Router Freedom</a>, or countries like 
<a href="/news/2023/news-20230313-01.html">Greece, which was not able to 
fully commit</a> to end-users rights, allowing Router 
Freedom only for limited types of networks.</p>

<p>That’s why we count on your support. There is still a lot to be 
done. <a href="/news/2024/news-20240307-01.html">Device 
Neutrality is threatened </a> not only by internet service providers, 
but also by software and hardware manufacturers and vendors not 
respecting end-users freedoms and rights. We strongly believe that 
software freedom should be the default standard and end-users should 
not be imprisoned into lock-ins. Tech companies should not trap users 
into walled gardens that limit what they can do with their devices.</p>
