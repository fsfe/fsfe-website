      Our work can be divided in four often intertwined categories,
      represented on the timeline below. "Internal" 🤝︎ presents the work
      accomplished to have a solid structure, carrying efficiently the rest of
      FSFE's actions. "Policy" 🏛︎ brings together successes brought by a
      continuous involvement in local, national and European law making
      processes. "Legal" ⚖︎ presents the achievements of the Legal team, and
      "Public" 📣︎ lists the largest steps of our general advocacy work and
      campaigns.
