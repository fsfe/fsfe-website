      <p>After 4 events and 60 Linux installations, the format by Marco Crotta and Valentino Spataro returns.<br />In addition to installing Linux, we will test open source and free software for both Linux and Windows. We will bring users’ and companies’ PCs back to life instead of throwing them away.</p>
     <p>Participants should bring:<br /> Their own fully charged laptop (preferably 64-bit with 8 GB of RAM)<br /> A USB flash drive<br /> With this, they will turn outdated hardware into a fast, modern PC. Experts will show how Linux provides stability, security, and efficiency even on older computers.</p> <p>IMPORTANT: Make a full backup of all data (emails, settings, passwords, licenses) to an external drive and leave it at home. Linux can be run in live mode without modifying the PC, but if you choose to install it, all data must already be backed up.</p> <p>The event is free with mandatory registration (limited seats).<br /> Easy to reach: Metro M2 Lambrate, tram lines 19 and 33, bus 54.</p> <p>Via Valvassori Peroni<br /> 20134, Milan, Italy</p>
