<p>The GNU Project was announced 1983 by Richard M. Stallman and set
out in 1984 to create a Free Software Unix-like operating
system. Variants of this system, using the Linux kernel, are in wide
use anywhere on this planet. These GNU/Linux systems are the basis of
every so-called "Linux" distribution today.</p>

<p>In the scope of the GNU Project, the Free Software Foundation was
founded in 1985; originally to take care of the legal needs of the GNU
Project.</p>

<p>The FSF Europe supports the FSF North America in its ongoing work
on the GNU Project in both legal and technical areas.</p>
