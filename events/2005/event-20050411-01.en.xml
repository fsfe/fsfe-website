       <title>WIPO Meeting on Development Agenda</title>
          <body>
             From 12. April to 15. April, the FSFE will participate in the
  inter-sessional intergovernmental meeting of the World Intellectual
  Property Organisation (WIPO) in Geneva. As only permanent observers
  were invited to participate, most Civil Society organisations will
  not be allowed to attend this highly critical meeting on the future
  agenda of WIPO. The FSFE delegation so far consists of Georg Greve,
  Karsten Gerloff and Volker Grassmuck. Together with other Civil
  Society actors, they will work to see WIPOs mission reoriented
  towards increasing intellectual wealth and see Free Software
  questions properly addressed.
