<p>Software licences tell people how the rights holder (usually the author) 
wants the software to be used and what freedoms or restrictions it has. 
Without a licence, many uses of the software may be prohibited.</p>

<p>Free Software licenses are licenses that give permission for a user to
obtain four important freedoms; the freedom to use, modify, share and
improve software [1]. Copyleft licenses are Free Software licences that
allow the four fundamental freedoms under the condition that those
freedoms remain intact in further distribution of the software or
derivative works.</p>

<p>The GNU GPL is the most famous Free Software copyleft license and is
used by a large percentage of Free Software projects.  It has many
useful features, like ensuring the four freedoms and providing a limited
warranty and disclaimer of liability clause to protect developers
releasing their work to the public [2].</p>

<p>There are many Free Software licenses, some without any copyleft effect.
Some of these are compatible with the GNU GPL, some have special
provisions that enable compatibility, some are incompatible [3].</p>

<p>If people use the same licence or at least compatible licences then
projects can exchange code freely.  We encourage everyone to use the 
GNU GPL for all software.</p>
