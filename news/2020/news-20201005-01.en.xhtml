<h1>FSFE is hiring a working student as an assistant system administrator</h1>

<p>
  We are looking for a working student to support our work to empower
  people to control technology. The person will work 10 hours per week
  in the Berlin office (home office possible at a later stage) and will
  support the FSFE's technical infrastructure by working closely
  together with our system administrators.
</p>

<h2>About the FSFE</h2>

<p>
  Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to
  control technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our
  lives and it is important that technology empowers rather than
  restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use,
  understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other
  fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free
  Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and
  self-determination. It enhances users' rights by abolishing barriers
  to Free Software adoption, encourages people to use and develop Free
  Software, and provides resources to enable everyone to further
  promote Free Software in Europe.
</p>

<p>
  We are involved in <a href="/activities/">many activities</a> in the
  legal, economic, political and technical areas around Free Software.
  Our work is made possible by a community of volunteers, supporters,
  donors, and staff. The assistant system administrator's job will
  strengthen the technical backbone of our operations.

<ul>
  <li>Working closely together with technical staff and volunteers.</li>
  <li>Regularly maintaining some of <a
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/TechDocs/Services">our systems</a>, e.g.
  upgrades, health and security checks, or Docker image updates.</li>
  <li>Running and assisting with defined projects for the improvement
  and modernisation of our systems.</li>
  <li>Helping staff and volunteers in case of technical problems,
  especially for the systems you regularly take care of.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>

  <li>Fluency in written and spoken English. Other European languages
  are considered an asset.</li>
  <li>Proven experience with system administration of GNU/Linux
  servers.</li>

  and Nginx), Ansible, Proxmox.</li>
  <li>Enthusiasm for the principles of Free Software, its community and

<h2 id="attitude">Attitude</h2>

<p>
  We are looking for a reliable, well-organised member of our technical
  teams who is keen to learn about old and new technologies. You
  support the whole organisation in its mission. Long-term thinking,
  efficiency and effectiveness are more important to you than the
  newest cool technology on the block.
</p>

<h2 id="details">Working time and compensation</h2>

<p>
  The desired working time would be 10 hours per week but can be
  discussed. You will start working in our Berlin office to get a
  feeling for the organisation and the faces behind it, but at a later
  stage, home office is possible. The salary is based on the currently
  applicable minimum wage in Germany but can be higher depending on
  your experience.
</p>

<h2 id="apply">How to apply</h2>

<p>
  To apply, please send a maximum one-page cover letter -- including
  the desired hours per week -- and a maximum two-page CV (only PDFs
  are accepted) by email to jobs@fsfe.org, with the subject "sysadmin
  student". Please do not include pictures of yourself in the
  application.
</p>

<p>
  Your personal data will be deleted 3 months after we have made our
  decision. The closing date for applications is <em>Sunday 15 November
  2020</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Free Software is meant to serve everyone regardless of their age,
  ability or disability, gender identity, sex, race, religion or
  sexual orientation. Hence, we encourage applications from all
  backgrounds and promise to judge all applications on merit, without
  reference to any of the characteristics listed. To promote diversity
  and equality in the Free Software community, we shall give preference
  to applicants who identify as part of a traditionally marginalised
  demographic in technology for applications of equal strength.
