<p>The Freedom Task Force coordinates a European Legal and Technical Network.  Each participant is referred to as a 'delegate' of the respective network.  Membership is by invitation only and if you are interested in participating you can <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>Our goal is to strengthen the legal foundation of Free Software through building connections between professionals and researchers active on the continent. The network currently has over 50 legal experts, over 30 technical experts and covers sixteen European countries.  It also maintains contacts in Canada, the USA, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.</p>

<p>Some network delegates are explicitly recommended by FSFE.  To be explicitly recommended the delegate must be <a href="legal-network-policy.html">approved</a> by the governing council of FSFE.</p>
