    <h1>Information for Booth Volunteers</h1>

	<h2>Why this work is important</h2>

    <p>
      One of the main tasks of the Free Software Foundation Europe is to inform
      the public about Free Software and related topics. For this, it is
      essential to be present with a booth on tradeshows, fairs and expos.
      Helping with this task means supporting FSFE in its very basic work.
    </p>

    <p>
	  Booth volunteers talk to people to explain Free Software, FSFE's work and
	  answer their questions. Working as a booth volunteer means at the same
	  time supporting Free Software, meeting interesting people, and having a
	  lot of fun.
    </p>

	<h2>How to prepare</h2>

    <p>
      At every event, there will be experienced people from the FSFE present to
      support the booth volunteers, so it is not necessary at all to be an
      expert in every single aspect of Free Software. However, some basic
	  knowledge about Free Software and the FSFE is helpful:</p>

	  <ul>
		  <li>The <a href="/about">"About us"</a> section is a good source for this.</li>
		  <li>Beside that you should read through our <a href="/documents/printable/">leaflets</a> to get an overview of our current activities.</li>
	  </ul>

	<h2>How to start</h2>

    <p>
      There is a booth mailing list where FSFE's presence at all kinds of
      events is coordinated. Everybody intersted in helping out can subscribe
      <a href="http://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/booth">here</a>.
