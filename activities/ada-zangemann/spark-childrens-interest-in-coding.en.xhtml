  <h1 class="p-name">Spark children's interest in coding</h1>

  <p>The FSFE has created the illustrated book "Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of
  Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream" under an Open Education
  License (like Wikipedia). The story is about the famous inventor Zangemann
  and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment with hardware
  and software, and in the process realises how crucial technology is for her
  and others. It is a fascinating story for children starting from 6 years and
  motivates them, and especially girls, to tinker with hardware and software
  and encourage them to shape their own technology.</p>

  <h2>Readings, discussions, workshops: Inspire children around the world</h2>

  <p>Our volunteers, staff, and the author of the book have done many readings
  in different languages throughout the world. By reading the book to over 1000
  children in the last months we made the experience that children, especially
  girls, afterwards want to get into "inventing things" and programming.</p>

  <p>For the events we have collaborated with schools, libraries, cities,
  organisations that introduce children into programming, and organisation
  working with refugee children.</p>

  <h2>Make the story accessible for all</h2>

  <p>We would like to make the materials accessible for everyone. Thanks to
  donations, the FSFE was able to release Arabic and Ukrainian translations of
  the book. A French translation and publication was coordinated by the French
  Ministry of National Education. A car company commissioned a Spanish
  translation, and volunteers have translated the book into Valencian, Danish,
  Hindi, Italian, and are working on other languages.</p>

  <p>We are also working with organisations and publishers on accessible eBook
  versions for people who read differently due to conditions such as blindness
  or low vision.</p>

  <h2>Reach more children with a movie</h2>

  <p>To reach more children, we will create a animated video version of the
  book produced by an experienced 2D animation studio, also published as an
  Open Educational Resource. Everyone will be able free to download and share
  the video, put it on their or the schools computers, ship it with other
  education material, embed it on company's and organisation's websites, or
  display the video at events.</p>
