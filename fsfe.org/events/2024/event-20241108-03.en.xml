      <p>The FSFE is a consortium member of the EU’s Next Generation Internet initiatives (https://fsfe.org/activities/ngi/ngi.en.html). As part of our work there over the past 6 years, we have looked at hundreds of participating Free Software projects, to assist them with their legal and licensing questions, as well as to help them become REUSE compliant.</p>
     <p>Lina Ceballos from the FSFE will speak about some simple trends in Free Software legal and licensing that we’ve observed over the years in independent Free Software projects and their developers, and how these affect aspects of the Free Software ecosystem.</p>
