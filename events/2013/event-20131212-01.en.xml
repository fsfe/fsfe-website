   <title>Fellowship Meeting with the topic "Save online content to read it while you or the content is offline" in Berlin, Deutschland</title>
   <body>
    On December 12 will be the next Berlin Fellowshipmeeting in the e-lok (near Ostkreuz). Erik will discuss with us different possibilities about how to "Save online content and read it while you or the content is offline". Included is a live-presentation of the software "Zotero". In addition, there will be a report about FSFE's official activities during the last month.

    As usual, the Fellowship meeting is a good possibility to meet other Fellows as well as other Free Software enthusiasts. You can get good food and best drinks at e-lok for a reasonable price and good mood for no cost. Official start is at 19:30.
