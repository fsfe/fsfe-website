    <title>FSFE - Open Letter to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</title>
  
  
  <body>
  
	<p>In recent weeks, political events in Istanbul have been the focus of international media. Important discussions are taking place about Turkey's government and her people. Several have lost their lives in the process.<br />
	Days before the protests in Taksim Square erupted, President Erdoğan was in America. On  behalf of an ambitious education investment project called FATIH, he toured Silicon Valley as the guest of America's largest technology companies, each of whom are hoping to land a contract for more than 10 million new tablet computers.<br />
	As the safety and freedom on the street of Turkey's activists is hotly debated in the press, the safetly and freedom of her children to learn has understandably received much less attention. Whether it is publicly discussed or not however, $5 billion will soon be spent on education, and it's impact on the rights of the next generation of Turkey's students will be immense. <br />
	Get involved with the <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/education/education.en.html">Education Team</a> to promote Free Software in schools and universities.</p>

		<p>Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,</p>
		<p>Recently you visited America to discuss the acquisition of 10.6 million tablets from leading technology companies on behalf of your Government, for Turkish students, as planned in the <a href="http://fatihproject.com/">FATIH project</a>.</p>
		<p>And we urge you to take alternatives into consideration, due to the software on the tablets.<br />
		The three companies that hosted you, Apple, Google and Microsoft design software that restricts users from seeing, studying, customising or understanding. Such software is tied to the tablets that they sell, and if you purchased from those companies, it would constrain the students of FATIH.</p>
		<p>Free Software, contrastingly, protects students' rights to use, study, share, and improve it. In an  educational context these rights can make the difference between  consumers and creators. Without these freedoms, students cannot experiment or develop the  understanding necessary to lead digital economies.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, software support and maintenance is expensive, and proprietary software exacerbates these costs by restricting who can provide you with services. By using Free Software, Turkish schools would loose the dependency on a single vendor, and competition for service contracts would be more competitive.</p>
		<p>Finally, for better security of both schools and students, Free Software makes its code available, providing evidence of how it functions. This week's revelations surrounding British Government <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/17/turkey-russia-g20-spying-gchq">spying on Turkish politicians</a> at the G20 summit highlight the importance of software security and privacy - educational computers should not provide <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">back-doors for foreign Governments and companies</a>.</p>
		<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/29/the-state-of-linux-how-even-apple-is-going-open-source/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/">Google</a> and <a href="http://msopentech.com/">Microsoft</a> all embrace Free Software themselves, and use it internally. Making the step towards Free Software tablets is important however, and several global manufacturers and distributors offer free software devices for sale. Will the freedom of Turkey's citizens be considered in your forthcoming decision to purchase tablets?</p>
		<p>Please send us your answer, and do not hesitate to contact us should you have further questions about the contents of this letter.</p>
		<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
		<p>FSFE</p>
