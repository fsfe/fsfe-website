<h1 id="fosdem-2023-check-our-talks-">FOSDEM 2023: check our talks!</h1>

<p>
  Whether you missed FOSDEM or didn&#39;t have time to attend all of 
  our sessions, don&#39;t worry! Have a look at all our sessions from 
  the last edition and learn, deepen your knowledge, and improve your 
  Free Software skills.
</p>
<p>
  It was great to see many of you in Brussels at FOSDEM! At this 
  edition, which took place on the first weekend of February, we had 
  the chance to meet in person, exchange opinions and have fruitful 
  discussions with the Free Software community. We also had the chance 
  to give several talks, the recordings of which are already available 
  for everyone to watch.
</p>

<h3>Legal &amp; Policy DevRoom</h3>

<p>
  As in previous editions, FSFE co-hosted the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/legal_and_policy_issues/">Legal 
  &amp; Policy Devroom</a>, where various issues related to the topic were 
  discussed. 
</p>

<p>
We encourage you to check the talk of our volunteer and supporter, Luca Bonissi, about the Windows and Office "tax" refund.

any device</figcaption>

<p>
  Among the rest of the interesting talks was one from Marcela 
  Kolaja, member of the European Parliament, that explained the EU pilot 
  project “De-monopolized access to EU applications”.

<h3 id="tedective">TEDective</h3>

<p>
  TEDective is a Free Software solution that is currently in 
  development. It makes European public procurement data explorable for 
  non-experts. TEDective <a href="/news/2022/news-20221026-01.html">won the the transparency 
  challenge of the EU Datathon 2022</a>.  It improves access to the data 
  published by Tenders Electronics Daily (TED), allowing companies, 
  organisations, journalists, etc. to explore and understand how public 
  money is spent across Europe.

<p>
  To shape the future of TEDective we are also looking for people who 
  want to be involved in this Free Software tool, who can provide extra 
  funding, and who once the application is ready will be beta-testers. Are you 
  one of them? Then let us know at <email>tedective@fsfe.org</email>.
</p>

<h3 id="public-money-public-code-">Public Money? Public Code!</h3>

<p>
  We are sure that, by this time, you have already heard about our 
  campaign <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">‘Public Money? Public 
  Code!’</a>. At FOSDEM we presented a policy briefing on the state of 
  Free Software in the European Union and how to effectively promote 
  Free Software across Europe.

<h3 id="reuse">REUSE</h3>

<p>
  Copyright and licensing is difficult, especially when reusing 
  software from different files that are released under  
  different licenses. <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> was 
  started by the Free Software Foundation Europe to provide a 
  set of recommendations to make licensing your Free Software easier. 
  At FOSDEM we focused on explaining how it works at the Software Bill of 
  Materials devroom.
