			<p>FSFE will be present with a booth in LinuxCon+ContainerCon

			architects and all levels of technical talent gather together 
			under one roof in order to further develop the Linux platform. 
			If you want to meet with us, then pass by our booth, where you 
			will have the opportunity to engage in interesting discussions, 
			to grab a bunch of stickers and flyers, and why not, to get a 
			new T-shirt or a bag from FSFE' s merchandise?!</p>
