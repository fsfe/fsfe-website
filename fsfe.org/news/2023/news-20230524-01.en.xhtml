<h1>Interoperable Europe Act: Committee of the Regions fails to substantially promote Free Software</h1>

<p>
The Committee of the Regions approved its opinion on the 
Interoperable Europe Act. The EU representative body has failed to recognise 
the importance that Free Software has for interoperability and thus for 
digitalisation and innovation.  This underlines the relevance of the Free 
Software Community's participation in the planned 
Interoperable Board.

<p>
With the EU's objective of establishing a legal framework on 
interoperability through the Interoperable Europe Act, today the 
Committee of the Regions has adopted its opinion in plenary. While the 
opinion has feebly mentioned the role of Free Software in achieving 
cross-border interoperability and avoiding vendor lock-in in its policy 
recommendations, the Committee of the Regions has failed to 
substantially improve the original text and bring up more solid 
and necessary measures. It does not introduce a  “Free Software first” 
approach and the involvement of stakeholders in the Interoperable 
Europe Board, an intended body that will decide on upcoming steps 
arising from this legislation.

<blockquote>
 <em> "It is incomprehensible that the institution that has the responsibility 
 to bring up the demands of thousands of local and regional 
 administrations fails in featuring the importance of Free Software for 
 interoperability. Hence, this decision only reaffirms the importance of 
 the involvement of stakeholders, who have actual competence, in these 
 decision-making processes. We, therefore, urge the European Parliament 
 to include the Free Software community in the Interoperable Europe 
 Board to guarantee sustainability and innovation in digitalisation. 
 Furthermore a 'Free Software first' approach still needs to be 
 introduced", explains Lina Ceballos, FSFE Policy Project Manager.

<p>
The role that Free Software plays in the digitalisation of local and 
regional administrations has been shown to be of great importance, 
especially  during the coronavirus pandemic. Among other things, it strengthens 
digital sovereignty allowing administrations to have control over the 
software they are using, while it enables that public funds are spent 
in the most efficient way. For these reasons, the 
FSFE has been demanding with its <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">'Public Money? Public 
Code!' initiative</a> that publicly financed 
software should be made publicly available under a Free Software 
licence. It is now up to the European Parliament to ensure that 
interoperability is introduced by a <italic>“Free Software first” </italic> approach 
while including the Free Software community on the path to digitalise 
European public administrations. First amendments in this direction 
have been introduced already; however, the position has to be further 
improved. <a href="/news/2023/news-20230323-02.html">Further read</a>.
