<h1>Today is DFD ‘09, global day for document liberation</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">A great global community is gathering today to celebrate the second Document Freedom Day. After a successful 2008 celebration, Document Freedom Day teams all over the world are joining efforts to raise awareness for Document Freedom and Open Standards.</p>

<p>In a world where records are increasingly kept in electronic form, Open Standards are crucial for valuable information to outlive the application in which it was initially generated. The question of Document Freedom has severe repercussions for freedom of choice, competition, markets and the sovereignty of countries and their governments.</p>

<p>"We are happy to see our community getting bigger this year", says Ivan Jelic, DFD Coordinator. "We expect large variety of activities organized by DFD teams, from speeches and informative events, to university document liberation or open standard promotion in local governments."</p>

<p>"Like all Open Standards, Document Freedom provides users with the freedom to choose their application freely, and yet still be able to communicate and collaborate with others.", explains Georg Greve, president of FSFE. "This freedom of choice provides the basis for competition in the field of text processing software. Where there is healthy competition, companies and software developers are driven to innovate, and monopoly pricing becomes impossible. So Document Freedom means better software and lower cost. Document Freedom also means that yesterday’s documents can easily be read with tomorrow’s software, protecting and preserving your data against forced vendor incompatibilities through the upgrade treadmill."</p>

<p>The DFD team will do its best to gather all the information about this year activities, organize them and publish on DFD web pages. If you have material about local document liberation activities, please send mail to: contact AT documentfreedom.org</p>
