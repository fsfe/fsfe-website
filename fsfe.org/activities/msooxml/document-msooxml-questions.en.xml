    <title>Six questions to national standardisation bodies</title>
    <description>
      Six questions relating to the application of the ECMA/MS-OOXML
      format to be accepted as an IEC/ISO standard. Unless a national
      standardisation body has conclusive answers to all of them, it
      should vote no in IEC/ISO and request that Microsoft incorporate
      its work on MS-OOXML into ISO/IEC 26300:2006 (Open Document
      Format).
