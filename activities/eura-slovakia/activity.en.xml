    <title>EURA Slovakia case</title>
    <description>
      The Slovak company EURA Slovakia has been facing EUR 5600 in
      fines because it did not buy and use the Microsoft Windows
      operating system for submitting electronic tax reports. Slovak
      tax administration gave EURA only two options: either to buy and
      use Microsoft Windows or face the fines. The FSFE assisted in
      this case to advocate for platform-neutral solutions for such
      procedures instead. Unfortunately, the court decided against Free
      Software and Open Standards, but we were able to raise awareness
      about these wrongdoings in Slovakia and beyond.
