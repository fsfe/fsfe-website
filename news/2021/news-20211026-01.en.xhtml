<h1>Router Freedom at risk: Latvia allows restrictions to consumers' rights</h1>

<p>
Latvia's reform of the telecom law weakens Router Freedom in the country. The national regulator SPRK has allowed ISPs to restrict the use of personal routers on the grounds of "technological necessity". In this article we explain why this is a bad idea. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="/activities/routers/routers.html">Router Freedom</a>, is the right end-users have to choose and use their own modems and routers to connect to the Internet. Since 2020, European countries are in a <a href="/news/2020/news-20200601-01.html">process of implementing</a> this right in the context of a reform of telecommunications law. Differently from countries like <a href="/news-20210629-01.html">Finland</a> and <a href="/news-20210805-01.html">the Netherlands</a>, which successfully implemented the reform protecting Router Freedom, Latvia has created a riskful  precedent against end-users rights by allowing internet service providers (ISPs) to determine restrictions on the use of personal routers and modems based on "technological necessities". The FSFE has engaged with the Latvian regulator <a href="https://www.sprk.gov.lv/en">SPRK</a> to stress the necessity to change the law as it represents a big loss for consumer rights.   
</p>

<h2>What are "technological necessities" against Router Freedom?</h2>

<p>
Routers and modems are terminal equipment. They are located in the division where the ISP's and end-user's  networks meet. In order to determine whether which network should the router be part of, the reform  of the telecom law has focus on the  localization of the network termination point (the NTP). The European regulator BEREC has identified three positions, called points A,B,C (see picture below) where routers and modems could be considered as part of the end-user domain or part of the public network. The standard position should be point A. This means that the router and modem are under the control of the user, who can decide which device to use - either the one recommended and provided by the ISP or one from a third party. That would result in Router Freedom.

<p>
However, in case the national regulators spot any justifiable technological necessity, the NTP could be defined in positions B or C, which would limit Router Freedom. According to BEREC, the <a href="https://berec.europa.eu/eng/document_register/subject_matter/berec/download/0/9033-berec-guidelines-on-common-approaches-to_0.pdf">assessment criteria</a> for such necessities include:      
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Interoperability between the public network and the terminal equipment;</li>
	<li>Simplicity of operation;</li>
	<li>Network security;</li>
	<li>Data protection;</li>
	<li>Local traffic;</li>
	<li>Fixed-line services based on wireless technology.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The FSFE <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-router-freedom-activity-summary.pdf">has been advocating</a> that only Router Freedom could meet these criteria. Besides, the European experience has demonstrated that no such necessities were identified by the regulators. In fact, the allowance of discretionary power to set the NTP at three different positions can impose significant barriers to end-users effectively using their equipment. Such criteria open a dangerous precedent for discretionary and unfair measures against Router Freedom. ISPs'  political and economic influence could easily override the high thresholds for these necessities in order to have the router or modem out of end-user's domain. Moreover, when national regulators provide little information how such necessities were identified, proving them wrong becomes excessively hard.      
</p>


<h2>Latvia allows ISPs to determine technological necessity</h2>

<p>
Our <a href="/news/2021/news-20210505-01.html">latest reports</a> warned national regulators against restricting the usage of personal devices on the grounds of technological necessities that could not be found or determined in the last years of European experience. Nevertheless, Latvia has <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/Projekts%20-%20Priek%c5%a1likumu%20un%20koment%c4%81ru%20apkopojums%20VA%20un%20Reg_not.pdf">allowed</a> (Latvian) ISPs to determine by themselves technological necessities to justify considering retail routers and modems part of their network, clearly against Router Freedom. 
</p>

<p>
The FSFE <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe%20latvia%20ntp%20consulation.pdf">stressed to the regulator</a> how this decision could not be compliant with EU law and could seriously hamper end-users' rights. In response, the regulator affirmed that in last instance they will check  whether such necessities identified by the ISPs would be compliant with BEREC guidelines. We at FSFE understand that such workflow would create a layer of oppacity and difficulty for consumers which could have their rights upheld until a decision by the regulator would be taken on specifics of the necessity criteria. In the end, ISPs would have much greater liberty in creating situations where such necessities would be easy to prove and hard to counterpoint, although other EU countries have not found any evidence in favour of it.

<h2>What Latvian consumers can do?</h2>

<p>
The new regulations make it very hard for consumers to counteract when their ISP allegates against Router Freedom on the grounds of a technological necessity. However, the regulation impose to the ISPs the duty to publish on their website information about this. Consumers are encouraged to report their experience in our <a href="https://survey.fsfe.org/index.php/628449?lang=en">Router Freedom survey</a>. It will help us to understand the practices better and escalate the issue to decision makers.

<h3>The Router Freedom initiative</h3>

<p>
<a href="/activities/routers/routers.html">Router Freedom</a> is the right that consumers of any Internet Service Provider (ISP) have to choose and use a private modem and router instead of equipment that the ISP provides. Since 2013, the Free Software Foundation Europe has been successfully engaged with Router Freedom, promoting end-users' freedom to choose and use their own terminal equipment - first in Germany as a precedent, and now in many European countries. Join us and learn more about the several ways to <a href="/news/2021/news-20210330-01.html">get involved</a>. In addition, by becoming a <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">FSFE donor</a>, you help make possible our long-term engagement and professional commitment in defending people's rights to control technology.
