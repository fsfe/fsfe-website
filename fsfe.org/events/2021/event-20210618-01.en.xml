        <title> "Public Money? Public Code!": A campaign framework to promote software freedom (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>On Friday, 18th June at 14:00 pm (CEST), Bonnie Mehring, FSFE's junior project manager, will present "Public Money? Public Code!: A campaign framework to promote software freedom" at the openSUSE Conference. The campaign framework of "Public Money? Public Code!" enables people all over Europe to promote software freedom in their local public administration. More than 200 organisations, and more than 29,000 individuals demand that publicly financed software should be made publicly available under Free Software licenses. Together we contacted politicians, decision makers, and civil servants on all levels -- from the European Union and national governments, to city mayors and the heads of public libraries about this demand. This did not just lead to important discussions about software freedom with decision makers, but also already to specific policy changes. Already, we have administrations from Spain, Sweden and Germany supporting "Public Money? Public Code!". In the talk, Bonnie Mehring will explain how the campaign framework can be used to push for the adoption of Free Software friendly policies in your area; be it your public administration, your library, your university, your city, your region, or your country. Registration for the event is needed, but it is free of charge.</p>
