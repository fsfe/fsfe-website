<h1>Congratulations to the FSF on its thirty-fifth anniversary</h1>

<p>
  The FSFE's sister organisation, the FSF, celebrates its thirty-fifth
  anniversary this week. Thirty-five years of working for software
  freedom and inspiring many people and organisations to take a stand
  for user freedoms deserve big congratulations. Watch and read the
  congratulatory speech by FSFE President Matthias Kirschner.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    35 years ago the Free Software Foundation was founded to work for
    users' software freedom to use, study, share, and improve software.
    In hindsight this seems to be an obvious step; in the 1980ies it was
    visionary.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the years more and more people, organisations, companies, and public
    administrations learnt why Free Software is
    important for a free society.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile there are many different people and organisations out
    there contributing to software freedom every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together we can ensure that all humans can understand how software
    works, use the software for any purpose without discrimination, share
    it with others, and adapt it to their own specific needs. Together
    we can ensure the continued growth and success of the Free Software
    movement, which the FSF started.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you to the FSF, for preparing the ground for the Free Software
    movement, and for inspiring many organisations and people out there,
    including the FSFE and myself, to work for users' software freedom in
    the next decades to come.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you and happy anniversary!
  </p>

  guest speakers from the FSFE.
