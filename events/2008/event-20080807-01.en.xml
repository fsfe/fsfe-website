    <title>August Fellowship meeting in Brussels</title>
    <body>
      A Belgian Fellowship meeting will take place on Thursday August
      7th in Brussels. We will meet at 20:00
      in <a href="http://openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.85295&amp;lon=4.34191&amp;zoom=17&amp;layers=B00FTF">Caf√©
      Walvis, 209 rue Antoine Dansaert</a>, Brussels.  It's an
      informal meeting, like the last meeting, so we'll mostly chat
      about whatever Free Software topics the attendees are interested
      in.  We'll also continue the discussion of how to launch
      quarterly meetings, and Ciaran O'Riordan will give an update on
      OpenStreetMap.  This meeting can be discussed
      on <a href="https://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/fsfe-bnl">FSFE's
      Benelux mailinglist</a>.
