    <h1>Rules for the Legal Network</h1>

    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
        The Legal Network fosters a productive, cooperative discourse
        in a private setting, enabling the members to discuss legal
        questions away from contentious public debate. To be true to
        this objective, participants should be free to express bold,
        innovative ideas while feeling safe from judgment and personal
        attacks.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Since the inception of the Legal Network, a set of rules and
      practices has emerged and is always evolving to account for its
      increasing size, as well as the complexities of the interactions
      that take place within it. Some of these rules have became
      crucial to allow the discussions to be productive, others are
      simply good practices that facilitate our work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respect for the Code of Conduct and the Chatham House Rule is
      ensured by the FSFE. Please report breaches as soon as they
      happen to the Legal Coordinator as soon as they happen, so that
      appropriate measures can be taken in accordance with our <a
      href="#substantial-rules">substantial regulation</a> and <a
      href="#procedures">procedures</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- substantial regulations -->
    <h2 id="substantial-rules">Behaviour on the Legal Network</h2>

    <p>
      To ensure that freedom of expression and peace of mind are
      available to all those engaging in the discussions, the Legal
      Network requires their members to abide to its <a
      href="#coc">Code of Conduct</a>, which extends to the Legal
      Network mailing list and all Legal Network events. To allow
      participants a greater degree of independence and encourage them
      to propose bold ideas, any communication on the Legal Network
      mailing list and at Legal Network events is also <a
      href="#chr">protected</a> by the <a
      href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chathamhouserule">Chatham
      House Rule</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to keep discussion flowing and to maintain community and
      focus, all public facing contributions on the Legal Network
      mailing list are moderated by the FSFE, in accordance with
      our <a href="/activities/ln/modpolicy.html">Etiquette and
      Moderation guidelines</a>. Procedures on how to deal with breaches of the Legal Network's Code of Conduct can be found <a href="/activities/ln/ln-procedures.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="coc">The Legal Network Code of Conduct</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The Legal Network and its associated events are intended for
        professional non-partisan networking and collaboration in the
        Free Software community. Participants are expected to behave
        with courtesy and according to professional standards suitable
        for the widest international audience. Participants should at
        all times feel at ease expressing their own opinions on any
        relevant subject they feel is worth being considered by other
        members, without fearing any form of attack, reprisal or
        harassment.
      </p>

      <p>
        While on the FSFE IT infrastructure made available for the
        Legal Network (e.g. mailing lists, wiki) and at its events or
        related professional or social networking opportunities,
        participants shall not engage in discriminatory, disparaging or
        offensive speech or actions, including as to gender, sexuality,
        race, nationality, religion or profession, and in particular
        regarding any other member of the Network. Speakers should be
        especially aware of these concerns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neither the FSFE nor the Legal Network tolerate or condone any
        statements or actions by participants contrary to these
        standards. The FSFE’s Legal Team reserves the right to deny
        entrance and/or eject from an event (without refund) or its IT
        infrastructure (e.g. mailing lists, wiki) any individual whom
        it considers to be in breach of this code of conduct, even in
        private settings or non-Legal Network media such as blogs or
        public forums, when related to discussions that happened on the
        Legal Network or at its events, or in relation to its members
        as such.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please bring any concerns to the immediate attention of the <a
        href="/about/team.html">Legal Coordinator</a>, detailing the
        events and possibly providing a reference to any recording<a
        class="fn" id="ref-1" href="#fn-1">1</a> of the facts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unless explicitly otherwise stated for specific communication
        or where the relevant parties agree to being identified, the
        Legal Network and its associated events are held under the
        Chatham House Rule<a class="fn" id="ref-2" href="#fn-2">2</a>.
        Participants are free to use the information received, but
        neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor
        that of any other participant, may be revealed.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3 id="chr">The Chatham House Rule</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham
        House Rule, participants are free to use the information
        received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the
        speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.

    <!-- procedural regulations -->
    <h2 id="procedures">Procedures for the Legal Network</h2>

    <!-- Joining the Legal Network-->
    <h3 id="join">Joining the Legal Network</h3>

    <!-- Requirements -->
    <p>
      Given the high level of confidentiality of some discussions,
      admission to (and continued membership in) the Legal Network is
      subject to the approval of the F and depends on the respect of
      the <a href="#substantial-rules">Legal Network regulations</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Successful applicants will have profound expertise in legal
      matters pertaining to Free Software, and will join the Network in
      order to share their knowledge with their peers from around the
      world. While some members are indeed affiliated with prominent
      companies or organisations, this does not constitute a factor in
      assessing membership, which is awarded on a personal basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Legal Network thrives in the diversity of its members. As
      such, there is a particular interest in welcoming new experts
      from the geographical areas that are currently under-represented
      (i.e. Eastern European countries, the Baltic states, Asia, South
      America and Africa).
    </p>

    <!-- Procedure -->
    <p>
      If you would like to join or to propose someone as a Legal
      Network member, please <a
      href="/activities/ln/application.html">use our application
      form</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="creating-sigs">Creating a Special Interest Group</h3>

    <p>
      Any member of the Legal Network can propose the creation of a
      Special Interest Group on a new topic by simply contacting the <a

      declaring such interest directly on the Legal Network
    </p>

    <h3 id="breaches">Breaches of regulation</h3>

    <p>
      The respect of the Code of Conduct and the Chatham House Rule is
      ensured by the FSFE. In the event of a breach of these rules,
      depending on the gravity of the breach and its circumstances, the
      FSFE will decide what actions should be taken, with the advice of
      the Legal Network Council.
