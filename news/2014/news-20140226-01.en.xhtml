        <h1>FSFE comments on UK proposal on document formats</h1>
            <p>FSFE has
submitted <a href="http://standards.data.gov.uk/comment/865#comment-865">comments</a>
on a proposal by the UK government to use only document formats based
on <a href="/freesoftware/standards/def.en.html">Open Standards</a>
in future.
</p>
<p>
"We applaud the UK government for its focus on competition and
openness", says Karsten Gerloff, FSFE's President. "This proposal is
an example to other governments on how to do it right." 
</p>
<p>
The UK government has proposed to rely exclusively on open document
formats for newly created documents. Each of the proposed standards
(HTML, ODF, TXT, CSV) addresses a different technical need. These
recommendations are based on an extensive study of user needs among
the government's staff. 
</p>
<p>
"We are delighted that the UK government is using Free Software and
Open Standards in a strategic fashion. Their approach will likely
increase competition among suppliers, make public sector IT more
efficient, and reduce costs," says Gerloff.
