		<p><a href="/about/basics/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> is not only about computer programs but also about economic policies, democracy, fundamental freedoms or again equality in cultural and digital participations. To spread the knowledge about Free Software in the political sphere is therefore an important step to achieve. By participating in Ask Your Candidate campaign, you take part in this process and contribute to give our struggle for a Free Society a broader audience. With this campaign, either local, national or European politicians and political parties take engagements for or <a href="/campaigns/askyourcandidates/ask-parties.html">give statements about</a> Free Software and Open Standards. It enables every European citizen to vote in full knowledge and also provides FSFE with useful politicians' statements. Having a hand in this campaign, it is sowing Free Software and its values in the political debate!</p>

	<h2>Use our Software Freedom Pact</h2>

	</div>

	<p>Every candidate in an election who signs the Software Freedom Pact takes the engagement to defend and promote Free Software and Open Standards in all areas of public life. The Pact is available on our website and can be freely used by any citizen who wants to make a candidate being a signatory.</p>

	<p>The Software Freedom Pact is a good mean to promote and give a broader place for Free Software in the political sphere. By informing the press about a signature, it also enables the diffusion of this knowledge to a more global audience. The Pact is not only about politicians, it is a tool who brings information to all society.</p>

	<p>For politicians, signing the Software Freedom Pact is a good way to take position and affirm sharing our values. Besides, they can use it as a tool to find allies in order to promote and defend them efficiently in the political debate. For them, it is not only an engagement but also a useful electoral and political partner.</p>
	
	<p>The FSFE itself can not contact every political candidate in Europe. Hence, we encourage you to use the Software Freedom Pact in all elections where you are concerned. Please visit our dedicated page to find useful tips and download the Pact.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Ask Political Parties About Free Software</h2>
	  
	<div class="right">

	</div>

	<p>When a politician doesn't want to produce a signature, it remains still possible to ask him or her about Free Software: if it is impossible to have an engagement, let's <a href="/campaigns/askyourcandidates/ask-parties.html">ask for a statement</a>!</p>
	
	<p>A political statement is useful in several manners. First of all, it obliges the candidate to think about his position, to weigh the pros and cons and so, at the minimum, to hear our arguments. By providing an answer, the candidate takes position on a subject and, for FSFE, it become later a useful tool when it comes to remind a previous stance to an elected representative.</p>
	
	<p>However, this kind of statement is much more effective when it comes from a political group. That is why Ask Your Candidate campaign is also about <a href="/campaigns/askyourcandidates/ask-parties.html">providing a support</a> for local organizations or individuals who want to obtain a clear position from a political party about Free Software.</p>
	
	<p>For important elections, the FSFE will summarize in a visual and simple form the answers given by the different parties. In this way, we will help every citizen to make his choice and vote in full knowledge.</p>
