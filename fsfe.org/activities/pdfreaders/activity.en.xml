      The PDFreaders initiative aims to shine a spotlight on government 
      organisations that promote proprietary PDF readers. With the help of 
      activists across Europe, we have contacted these organisations and told 
      them how they can improve their websites to respect our freedom. On 
      <a href="https://pdfreaders.org">pdfreaders.org</a> 
      we present Free Software PDF readers for all major operating systems.
