    <title>Fellowship Meeting for the GNU Year in Paris</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        To begin the GNU year, FSFE fellows and free software activists will gather for a meeting in Paris to discuss topics such as how to promote freedom and privacy-respecting Android mobile systems, and engage a debate on how to deal with social networks in the internet age with the GNU Consensus initiative. But it is also a nice opportunity for a relaxed and informal moment together, open to everybody. [<a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/groups/Paris">See you at La Mutinerie.org, 19:00!</a>]
