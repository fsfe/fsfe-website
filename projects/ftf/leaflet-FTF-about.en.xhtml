    <p class="background">
      The Freedom Task Force (FTF) helps individuals, projects and businesses
      understand Free Software licensing and the opportunities that it
      presents.  We have a physical office in Zurich, Switzerland and our
      responsibilities are education, training, consultancy, fiduciary services
      and licence enforcement.  The FTF coordinates FSFE's legal activities and
      manages the Foundation's interaction with issues like the European
      Commission versus Microsoft anti-trust case.
