<h1>DMA &amp; Free Software: what Free Software organisations need to know</h1>

<p>
On 24 March the FSFE will conduct an online Q&amp;A session about the 
Digital Markets Act and its importance for representatives of Free 
Software organisations. The DMA was designed to limit the power of the 
"gatekeepers" and boost fairer digital markets. But what does its 
enforcement mean for Free Software? Join us for this strategic 
discussion.

<h2> Understanding the DMA’s impact on Free Software</h2>

<p>The <a href="/activities/dma/dma">Digital
Markets Act (DMA)</a> is the European Union’s regulation to promote fair
competition in the digital markets. The law applies to large tech
companies exercising “gatekeeper control” in the EU. The DMA imposes on
such companies several obligations, like allowing the right to install
and uninstall software in devices, prohibition of non-removable
pre-installed software, enabling third-party app stores, and access
rights via interoperability with software and hardware functions.</p>
<p>This event is specifically designed for members and representatives
of Free Software organizations to discuss the opportunities the DMA
creates for Free Software, such as enabling alternative app stores,
side-loading of applications, and improved interoperability
policies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the event will serve as a platform for discussing
FSFE’s legal efforts, specifically regarding its <a
href="/activities/apple-litigation/">litigation against
Apple at the Court of Justice of the European Union</a>. Attendees will
have the opportunity to engage directly with FSFE experts, ask
questions, and explore how their organizations can support and benefit
from the DMA’s implementation.</p>

<h3>Device Neutrality</h3>
<p>Although digital devices are ubiquitous today, the number of devices
on which users cannot run Free Software is exponentially increasing. The
consequence is a growing loss of control over users' technology. Device
Neutrality aims to enable end-users to bypass gatekeepers to have a
non-discriminatory use of Free Software on their devices.</p>
<p>In 2022, several components, part of the Device Neutrality concept,
were included in the <a href="/activities/dma/dma">Digital Markets Act
(DMA)</a>, the European Union's largest initiative to regulate
gatekeepers in digital markets. Although the law contains the principles
for making Device Neutrality a reality, its regulations concern only
very large platforms. The DMA establishes obligations for gatekeepers -
“dos” and “don'ts” they must comply with - and prescribes fines and
penalties for infringements. The DMA encompasses several rules
concerning Device Neutrality, including safeguarding the right to
uninstall pre-installed software and several measures for preventing
lock-in, as well as fostering interoperability and end-user control over
personal data. </p>
