	  <h2>The Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop 2015</h2>
    
	  <p>
		In 2015 the workshop took place, once again, in Barcelona on
		16-17 April, receiving more than 90 experts from all around the world.
		Instead of rehashing familiar topics, we looked at what problems
		we will likely encounter in the next five to ten years. Each day
		we had two topics to spur interesting debate in the room as well
		as the hallway. As always, the workshop was held under Chatham
		House Rule, to encourage an open and unencumbered debate.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Topics</h3>

	  <p>
		In 2015 we held a pre-event on 15 April, called the Open* Day,

			impact on public administrations and public procurement.

		During the workshop (16-17 April), we discussed some activities more stricltly
		linked to software:
