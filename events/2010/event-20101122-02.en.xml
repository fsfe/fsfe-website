	  <title>Conference: Tension between patents and the ICT
		  standardisation process</title>
	  <body>
	Technology standards are a powerful tool to promote or
	stifle software innovation. For Free Software, it is
	critical that even patented technologies which are
	included in standards can be implemented without
	restrictions. At a conference in Brussels organised by the
	European Commission, FSFE's President Karsten Gerloff will
	participate in a panel on Free Software and
	standardisation.
