		<h1>UK Open Standards experts publish joint statement on Government consultation</h1>

		<p>At a meeting yesterday, hosted by the British Computer Society's Open Source Specialists Group, We the Undersigned called upon the Government to do the following:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Not do anything which will result in the imposition in a stealth tax upon citizens, for example by requiring them to purchase specific products for interacting with online public services</li>
			<li>Ensure that anybody and everybody be able to participate in public sector procurement, regardless of their businesses model</li>
			<li>Leverage truly open innovative technologies to achieve long term savings</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Commitment to these points is critical if The Government is to achieve
		its stated aims of a more competitive and diverse market for public
		contracts, reduction of barriers to participation in public sector IT
		affecting small and medium size enterprises, and realisation of the
		potential benefits of its existing Open Data strategy.</p>

		<p>We believe that it is important that The Government moves quickly from
		setting Open Standards policy to practically implementing it, and we
		look forward to participating in the next steps of this process.</p>

		<p>Sincerely,</p>

		<p><strong>Howard Thomson, Martin Houston, Free and Libre Open Source Software UK,<br />
		Sam Tuke, Free Software Foundation Europe,<br />
		Graham Taylor, Open Forum Europe,<br />
		Gerry Gavigan, Open Source Consortium</strong></p>
