<p>
  In this issue, we discuss the rising awareness for Free Software in 
  France. We share our plans for monitoring the implementation of 
  Device Neutrality principles. A hackerspace in Albania shares the 
  ‘Public Money! Public Code’ demand. We are looking for a working 
  student to be our next system administrator assistant.

<p>
  What is the status of Free Software in France? According to Hugo Roy, 
  there is rising awareness in the last decade, but France still needs 
  a bold political stance supporting Free Software. Public procurement 
  should require the right to produce unlimited amounts of a copy of 
  the software. This requirement does not favour any company or 
  business model, and can be a part of a public procurement. Hugo Roy 
  is a lawyer and a Free Software supporter. Hugo appreciates the 
  welcoming environment of the FSFE for volunteers and likes CalyxOS 
  because it offers a ready-to-use environment on a phone and it is 
  reliable. <a href="/news/podcast/episode-16.html">Listen to his 
  interview in our new Software Freedom Podcast episode</a>.

<p>
  On a sidenote we think it is worth noting that we received more 
  signatures in our <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/openletter.html">open 
  letter for the right to install any software on any device</a> from 
  organisations throughout France than from any other country. This 
  might support Hugo’s observation of increased awareness towards 
  software freedom in France.

<h2 id="fsfe-monitors-the-implementation-of-device-neutrality">FSFE monitors the implementation of Device Neutrality</h2>

<p>
  Imagine unboxing your new tablet and finding out you can install new 
  apps only via the manufacturer’s own apps store. On top of that, your 
  device boots only a specific operating system, fully or partly 
  proprietary. In other words, you cannot install a different OS to 
  overcome such limitations. Your tablet deserves better.
</p>

<p>
  Device Neutrality is a policy concept to enable end-users to bypass 
  gatekeepers in order to run Free Software and use services 
  independently of the control exercised by hardware manufacturers, 
  vendors, and platforms. To help understand this policy concept, <a href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index#device-neutrality-free-software">we 
  published an article clarifying the requirements</a> of Device 
  Neutrality. So far we engaged in the field of device neutrality 
  during the adoption of the <a href="/activities/dma/dma.html">Digital Markets Act 
  (DMA)</a>, the European Union’s largest initiative to regulate 
  gatekeepers in digital markets. We saw a major win in 2022, as 
  several components of Device Neutrality were included in the DMA.

</figure>

<p>
  Our efforts are not over: now we have to make sure that the 
  regulation is enforced in practice. Monitoring the implementation and 
  enforcement of the DMA, conducting device-related activities, and 
  promoting software freedom require a lot of resources. <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">Please consider donating to the 
  FSFE so we can continue to work for device neutrality</a>.

<h2 id="hackerspace-in-albania-explains-why-privacy-matters">Hackerspace in Albania explains why privacy matters</h2>

<p>
  Massive leaks of personal data in Albania revealed personal 
  information of citizens last year. Hackerspace OpenLabs, an 
  associated organisation of the FSFE, raises awareness on privacy in 
  workshops and offers trainings on the safe use of technology. As 
  members of OpenLabs point out in an interview with Le Courrier de 
  Balkans, OpenLabs supports the use of Free Software in public 
  administrations and <a href="https://www.courrierdesbalkans.fr/Albanie-OpenLabs-un-hackerspace-pour-proteger-et-emanciper-le-numerique">spread 
  the message of the ‘Public Money? Public Code!’ campaign in 
  Albania</a>. Tirana City Hall was the first capital city in the 
  Western Balkans to switch to larger remote Free Software solutions. 
  Still, the country has to close the digital gap among citizens.

  they can contribute.

<h2 id="in-memory-of-damiano">In memory of Damiano</h2>

<p>
  The FSFE honours the memory of Damiano Conte, an important member of 
  the Free Software movement in Italy, and shares condolences to his 
  family. Damiano was a teacher of thousands of students in Bassano del 
  Grappa (VI) Italy during the last 20 years, and encouraged the use of 
  GNU/Linux and Free Software and hardware. In 2008 Damiano co-founded 
  the Bassano del Grappa Linux User Group (GrappaLUG). Since 2006 he 
  had been organising the Linux Day and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PcPAbs1Y5Y">giving talks</a>. 
  GrappaLUG sent a symbolic donation to the FSFE in memory of Damiano. 
  We thank Damiano for his long-term contribution to software freedom.
