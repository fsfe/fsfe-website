<h1>Upcycling Android: anchoring software freedom into European ecodesign</h1>

<p>
  At the Free Software Foundation Europe, we advocate for the universal right to
  install and de-install any operating system and software on any device. The update
  of the European ecodesign gives a historical chance to make this right part of
  European legislation. Our Upcycling Android campaign marks the beginning of our
  activities.
</p>

<p>
  More and more often we see pretty good hardware going to waste simply because
  the software or operating system running on it stops being supported. This is
  bizarre, considering the environmental footprint each of these electronic devices
  comes with. And it would be avoidable to a serious extent if users would have the
  legal right and technical liberty to install any fitting Free Software operating
  system on their own devices, as well as any software.

<h2>Reusing General Purpose Computers</h2>

<p>
  2022 is a decisive year for this demand: the European Union is about to reformulate
  their ecodesign criteria of products with several directives, from the 'Sustainable
  Product Initiative' to the 'Circular Electronics Initiative' to the 'Right to
  Repair'. We started to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12798-Energy-labelling-of-mobile-phones-and-tablets-informing-consumers-about-environmental-impact/F1465695_en">
  consult the European Commission</a> as early as possible on this. But since a
  multi-billion Euro industry of continuously selling newly manufactured devices
  with short-term supports is at stake, counter-lobbyism has also already started.
  A positive outcome is far from certain; and another update to the European ecodesign
  is not to be expected in this decade. If the role of software freedom is not considered
  as essential to the longevity and re-usability of our devices this time, the throw-away
  culture will continue.
</p>

<p>
  The solution is obvious: At the FSFE we want to empower people using general purpose
  computers with <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html#general-purpose-computers">
  the right to install any operating system on any device</a>. Manufacturers must not
  be allowed to create artificial restrictions preventing users from installing Free
  Software operating systems. We advocate for the necessary changes in the upcoming
  legislations, and you can empower us seizing the opportunity and bring a long-lasting
  change for European consumers and into the European markets.

<h2>Upcycling Android workshops</h2>

<p>
  Meanwhile, we already start making a difference. With our <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/">Upcycling Android</a>
  campaign, we show how we can use Free Software operating systems on our phones
  to fix software obsolescence, and keep using them longer. To help with this procedure,
  we are cooperating with local groups and give workshops together, showing people how to
  flash their phones. Your support will allow us to offer Upcycling Android workshops
  throughout Europe, and let people enjoy an ongoing usage of their phone!
</p>

<p>
  From legislation to workshops, let's maximise our efforts for software freedom and
  environmental protection. We demand true device neutrality to make technology long-lasting
  and repairable. Meanwhile, we extend our hardware lifespan and spare the planet
  the environmental impact of producing unnecessary new phones.
