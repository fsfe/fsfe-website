    Under the motto ’Unlocked’, the 37th edition of the Chaos Communication Congress is back as an in-person event and at its usual venue in Hamburg. Being one of the largest events of its kind, the annual congress opens its doors to around 16.000 hackers to meet, network, and discuss their favourite topics in talks, workshops and meet-ups. There is something for everybody at the 37C3. So come on in and be part of this years Congress!</p>
    
    <p>
    This year, the Free Software Foundation Europe is an active part of the 37C3 as part of the Bits &amp; Bäume cluster. Together, we will create a room for Free Software enthusiasts, Chaos-people, and everybody who wants to come together, connect and talk about Free Software.

    If you care about sustainability, drop by and let us explain how <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/">Free Software contributes to a “greener” society</a>. This year we are also happy to announce the new track “Sustainability &amp; Climate Justice”. Together with Freifunk, Fiff and many more, the FSFE is part of this years content-team behind the track. We are looking forward to your submissions about Free Software and sustainability at the 37C3!
