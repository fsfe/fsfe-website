    <h1>Unlocking education, for growth without limits</h1>

    <div id="introduction">

      <p>We want to enable all citizens to have free access to education and
      all other publicly-funded institutions, both online and offline, by
      pushing for a mandatory use of <a href="/projects/os/os.html">Open
        Standards</a> and a guaranteed platform-independent access to all
      online environments. This allows
      students and parents to use Free Software, and in that way being able to
      tap into their potential for growth and personal development.</p>
      
    </div>

    <h2>What we want</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>to strengthen the Dutch action plan "Netherlands Open in Connection"
      by making the use of Open Standards truly mandatory for all
      publicly-funded institutions,</li>

      <li>to  make vendor-independent access to all online services and
      information mandatory for all publicly-funded institutions, in this case,
      educational institutions;</li>

      <li>to promote innovative education in IT-skills by broadening the
      educational program with vendor-independent skill-sets.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>In the Netherlands, some students are locked out of online school
    environments due to use of proprietary web technology. They are forced to
    purchase proprietary software just to perform such basic tasks as handing
    in their homework, receiving assignments, cooperating on projects and
    passing exams. The Dutch Secretary of Education, in response to Parliament,
    states she considers multiyear vendor-lock acceptable, thus rejects the
    Dutch ambitious Open Standards policy framework, ignoring the short-term
    and long-term consequences:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>the enforced purchase of proprietary computer technology just to be
      able to participate in education is illegal and unconstitutional;</li>

      <li>it allows educational institutions offer the large majority of
      students only limited, vendor-specific skillsets, with the support of
      very few vendors of proprietary solutions;</li>

      <li>it reduces the innovative strength of the Dutch economy as the
      educational systems don't provide it with a sufficiently trained labour
      force;</li>

      <li>it forces Dutch companies, organizations and governments to spend
      billions of euro's each year on re-training, unnecessary and enforced
      upgrades on hardware, and license fees.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Background</h3>

    <p>Free Software users  have been encountering the problems with the use of
    proprietary technology and proprietary standards in education for quite
    some time now. This is an urgent problem that needs to be dealt with. Using
    proprietary technologies for public webbased services without giving good
    reasons for this is a deliberate choice for long-term vendor lock-in. This
    should always be prevented, especially in education and the public sector
    at large. FSFE wants to push the mandatory use of Open Standards in the
    public sector, not just in Dutch legislation, but throughout Europe.</p>

    <p>The Dutch parliament has been advocating the mandatory use of Open Standards for more than a decade, resulting in an ambitious and internationally acclaimed policy framework in 2007. This proud achievement is obstacled  by the Secretary of Education. She is not implementing the framework, so schools continue to use proprietary technology. As a consequence educational institutions are forcing students to use software from specific vendors. The situation is worse than in 2007 and needs to change now! This campaign aims at passing new and stronger legislation to ensure the  mandatory use of Open Standards, not just in education, but in the entire public sector.</p>
