    <title>DefensiveCon v02 in Berlin, Germany</title>

    <body>
      <p>The digital services offered and used by our public administrations are the critical infrastructure of democratic states in the 21st century. To establish trustworthy systems, public authorities must ensure that they have full control over the software and computer systems at the core of our government digital infrastructure. But at the moment this is rarely the case due to restrictive software licenses.</p>
      <p>In his presentation our Policy Manager Alexander Sander explain the status quo and how it can be changed. From the EU Commission's Bug Bounty Program to the CDU's party conference resolution on the use of Free Software. He will explain what we can expect in the coming years and what we have to keep in mind when using Free Software.</p>
