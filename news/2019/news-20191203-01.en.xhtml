<p newsteaser="yes">From Friday 15 November through Saturday 16 November 2019, the FSFE Community Meeting took place this year as part of SFSCon - a great Free Software event in the beautiful town of Bolzano in South Tyrol, Italy.  As usual, embedding an FSFE event in another event gave us the opportunity to meet different parts of the community as well as people we regularly see at other Free Software meetings.</p>
<p>On Friday, SFScon started officially and the NOI Techpark transformed into the interim capital of Free Software with talks and booths.  Of course, the FSFE booth was also part of it and the booth team commandeered the whole area by installing a balloon chain and putting up posters.  The rumours that the booth team gave away free pizza (not as in freedom) to gain more attention, are highly exaggerated, though.</p>

<p>There were many talks about software freedom, some of them were recorded by the SFScon team and are available to watch online. For instance, the <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/presentations/20191116-po-community-meeting-Free-Software-and-Open-Standards-in-Tourism.pdf">"Free Software and Open Standards in Tourism"</a> by Patrick Ohnewein available on <a href="https://vimeo.com/376168257">video</a>, the <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/presentations/20191116-bs-SFScon-FS-business-models.pdf">"Challenges with Free Software Business Models"</a> by Björn Schiessle, and <a href="https://vimeo.com/376168921">"Putting AI back into people's hands"</a>, and many more you can follow up with via the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/FSFECommunityMeeting2019#Agenda">event's page</a> </p>

<p>On Saturday, when the FSFE track and the Community Meeting started, the FSFE added another facet to the event with various of other talks, like the one on what <a href="https://vimeo.com/376166844">MicroG</a> is and what's its future by Marvin W . In his talk Marvin gave an overview of what Free Software replacements for Google services on Android are available. In his session on <a href="https://vimeo.com/376165649">sustainability of software</a>, Erik Albers talked why it is important to preserve software heritage and how communities and Free Software licensing help achieving that. In his talk <a href="https://vimeo.com/376164778">"Free Software legal licenses 101"</a>, Carlo Piana introduced to the attendees, why it is important for them to have a license when developing Free Software and what could be the consequences of improper licensing. The FSFE's current intern, Bonnie Mehring called out for support and actions from the citizens to <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/presentations/20191117-bm-community-meeting-public-administration-campaign-pmpc.pdf">write letters to local administrations</a> as part of our "Public Money? Public Code!" <a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/ContactingAdministrationsForPMPC">campaign</a>.  </p>

<p>At noon, the SFScon officially ended, but the FSFE Community Meeting continued throughout with talks about FSFE's involvedment with the <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/presentations/20191116-GK-community-meeting-NGI0.pdf">Next Generation Internet</a> projects where Gabriel Ku and Lucas Lasota presented the Open Calls the initiative launches and the licensing consultation they do for the winning solutions. The FSFE's coordinator for Zurich, Gian-Maria Daffré aka Giammi shared how the Swiss team was running the <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/presentations/20191116-Giammi-community-meeting-freedomvote.pdf">Freedomvote campaign for the Swiss elections</a>. The aim of the tool is to increase not only citizens participation, but to also get the political candidates more involved and in touch with their constituencies. The FSFE <a href="/news/2019/news-20191007-01.html">dedicated</a> an article on it back in October giving extra insights. </p>
<p>A nice part of the event were the more spontaneous activity sessions.  One major part there were the lightning talks, of course, where the spotlight was taken by Christian Busse's input about <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/presentations/20191116-cb-SFScon-European-Science.pdf">European science and research</a> benefitting from Free Software. A great energising session was the one where we encouraged all audience members to take the mic and briefly talk about their favourite Free Software. If you are curious to deploy more useful Free Software applications on your devices, some of the mentioned were the <a href="https://supertuxkart.net/Main_Page">tuxkart</a>, <a href="https://www.android.com/versions/kit-kat-4-4/">kitkat</a>, <a href="https://antennapod.org/">antennapod</a>, and the Metronom-App. 
It is great to think of how far our movement has come over the past 35 years, especially as we are facing new challenges on a regular basis.  Another productive session was when the audience split up and chose topics for breakout sessions such as what kind of events the FSFE should organize or be a part of, Freedomvote in France, further steps about REUSE, and an on-the-fly system hackers meeting to improve the jabber server to handle images in multi-user chats in future. </p>
<p>As always, at these community events, there was plenty of time for exchanging ideas outside of the official sessions and for socialising.  Our booth team was busy answering questions about the FSFE's position on certain issues, about our work, and more general Free Software questions. Of course, they were also busy selling <a href="https://fsfe.org/order/order.html">merchandise</a> and distributing information materials.  </p>

<p>The evenings we spent dining together and debating important issues, and sometimes late into the night, powered by amazing food (and desserts), delicious fresh mountain spring water with a hint of sun, and Hops smoothies from Bolzano.  </p>

<p>On Sunday, part of the community explored the town of Bolzano and its historical sites together, and put a relaxing ending to a great event. A big THANK YOU goes to everyone who helped organise the event and to everyone who participated! We are very much looking forward to seeing even more of you in the 2020. </p>
