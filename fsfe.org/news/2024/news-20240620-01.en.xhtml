<h1>Save time and minimise licensing headaches with REUSE</h1>

<p>  
REUSE helps make a project's licensing and copyright status more 
transparent, ensure that third-party code is properly attributed, and 
make the project's code easily reusable. This tool is currently used 
worldwide and its specification has been adopted by several corporate 
and institutional projects. We spoke to Matija Šuklje of Liferay 
International, one of the companies that has adopted REUSE.

<p><a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> is a set of best practices 
to simplify Free Software licensing, making licensing easy for humans 
and machines alike. It helps developers with simple guidelines for 
declaring their copyright and the conditions for reusing code, and 
provides help documents and low-threshold tools to get the job done.
</p> 

<p>
Led by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), this initiative seeks 
to solve a fundamental issue that Free Software licensing has at the 
very source: what license is a file licensed under, and who owns the 
copyright? A set of best practices and the helper tool make the task of 
adding this legal information in every single file of the project a 
simple practice.
</p>

<p>
Since its first release in 2017, the number of projects implementing 
REUSE in their workflows is steadily increasing. Liferay is one of the 
companies that use and sponsor REUSE so we talked with its Legal 
Director and Associate General Counsel (FOSS &amp; Community), Matija 
Šuklje.

<blockquote>
“When we switched to REUSE that kind of snowballed a lot of the internal 
processes to streamline our licensing documents, and to streamline some 
technical development, which caused us in turn to save a lot of 
engineering time and even shortened negotiations and sales cycles 
because things were much clearer”, <cite>explains Mr. Šuklje</cite>.
</blockquote>


<h3>REUSE  Software new version</h3>
<p><a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> is constantly evolving and 
improving. The  alpha version v3.1.0a1 of the REUSE tool was released a 
couple of weeks ago containing the new REUSE.toml 
functionality, and soon REUSE Specification v3.2 will be released.
</p>

<blockquote>
“The version 3.2 of the REUSE specification adds a long-awaited 
improvement in the form of REUSE.toml that helps projects declare their 
licensing with heightened flexibility and reduced ambiguity. Furthermore, the 
new TOML format is much easier to parse for third parties, allowing them 
to read and modify this file with their own tooling”, <cite>explains 
Carmen Bianca Bakker, coordinator of this initiative</cite>.
</blockquote>

<p>
More and more organisations, companies, and individuals are using REUSE 
and benefiting from the growing ecosystem of its specification, its helper 
tool, its API and all the documentation. As using REUSE does not require 
registration, there are not precise numbers about its users but we know 
that it is being adopted by:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>All 2000+ <a href="https://api.reuse.software/projects">compliant projects</a> of the REUSE API</li> 
	<li>
	Many projects of the <a href="/activities/ngi/">EU-funded Next 
	Generation Internet project</a> we help to become REUSE compliant from 
	the start.
	</li> 
	<li>
	<a href="https://www.dlr.de/de/medien/publikationen/broschueren/opensource-software_dlr_2022.pdf">DLR</a>, the <a href="https://community.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy#License_Statements">KDE community</a>, and <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/howto-archive-and-reference-your-code/">Software Heritage</a> made REUSE the standard for their licensing policy.
	</li> 
	<li>Corporate licensing policies of Siemens, SAP, Huawei, Liferay, and many more.</li> 
	<li>Large parts of the Linux Kernel with ~70% by now.</li> 
</ul>
<p>
The REUSE project is based on its community and the people who support 
and adopt it! The contribution of all our FSFE supporters also allows 
our continuing work on REUSE as well as on our other activities. You can 
join them by <a href="/donate/donate.html">becoming an FSFE 
	supporter</a> (and enabling our long-term work), you can spread the word 
	among your friends and convince them to <a href="/donate/donate.html">support our work with a small donation</a>, 
	and you can <a href="/contribute/contribute.html">contribute to Software 
	Freedom</a> in many other ways. Your support enables our work!
