        FSFE is one of four Free Software organizations in the world.
      </p>

    <p>
      The following organisations are sister organisations of the FSFE
      in the global FSF network.  We are working together on Free
      Software issues, each one with its own cultural background.  The FSFs
      are legally, financially and personally independent from each other,
      and like every network, the FSF* network is formed of interconnected
      components.
