        <title>FSFE Legal Education Workshop at NGI0 Webinars (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>Lina Ceballos and Gabriel Ku Wei Bin from the FSFE will talk about legal topics relating to Free Software. They will explain basic legal concepts such as licenses, copyright law, and other legal topics important for developers and the Free Software community in general.</p>
      <p>The 40-minute talk will be followed by a 20-minute demonstration of how to make licensing your free software projects easier with FSFE's REUSE initiative. Copyright and licensing are difficult, especially when reusing software from different projects that are released under various different licenses. REUSE provides a set of recommendations to make declaring licenses easier. After the talk and the demonstration, there will be time for questions and answers.</p>
