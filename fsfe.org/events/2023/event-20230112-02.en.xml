        <title>Documentation and translation - FSFE Greece country team meeting (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>
        The first meeting of the year for the FSFE Greece country team. The main topic, as chosen in our last meeting, will be &quot;Documentation in Greek and Free Software Greek translations&quot;, discussing challenges we face but also potential collaborations and solutions to common problems. After a break, we will discuss any recent updates from Free Software Foundation Europe activities. Also we will prepare an &quot;I Love Free Software&quot; meeting in Thessaloniki on February 14. The meeting will be in Greek, but we can interpret if someone wants to speak in English. We are meeting at 19:00 local time. Everybody interested in Free Software is welcome!
