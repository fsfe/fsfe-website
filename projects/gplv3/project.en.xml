    <title>GPLv3</title>
    <description>
  During 2006, there is a year-long public consultation process for
  the purpose of drafting version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
  This license, commonly called &quot;the GPL&quot;, is by far the
  most used license for <a href="/documents/freesoftware.html">Free
  Software</a>.  Free Software Foundation Europe is assisting that
  consultation process by building awareness about the GPL, helping
  people to participate in the process, spreading information to
  enable others to build awareness, and organising conferences.
