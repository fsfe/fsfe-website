<h1>The FSFE supports Dutch call to adopt social media platforms
that respect public values</h1>

<p>Last week six Dutch civic organisations launched the campaign <strong>
‘<a href="https://makesocialssocialagain.nl/">Make
Socials Social Again</a>’</strong>. They call upon public
organisations to adopt social media platforms that respect public values
and thus are the real ‘social’ platforms.</p>

<p>The campaign expresses the need for social media based on public
values like transparency, privacy and sustainability.</p>

<p>The FSFE joins this campaign to encourage a public debate on this. As
stressed in the <a href="https://fedigov.eu/">FediGov campaign</a> by
the Swiss FSFE local team. It is important that platforms used by public
bodies enable independent and self-determined use of technology. </p>

<p>The possibilities of using open and transparent systems, Free
Software and open standards to enable truly social media, contributing
positively to the public debate are legion. Good examples of this are,
the Mastodon pilots by <a 
href="https://fediversereport.com/dutch-government-officially-launches-mastodon-server/">the
Dutch government</a> and <a href="https://www.surf.nl/en/mastodon-pilot-for-research-and-education">SURF
and Universities of the Netherlands</a>. This encourages flexibility,
security, the possibilities to innovate, societal debate and our digital
</p>

<p>A series of events are lined up in the following weeks to support
interested parties in adopting alternative social media.</p>
<p>Join this Dutch campaign by using the hashtag #MakeSocialsSocialAgain
and use the campaign images.</p>
