    <h1>Newsletters</h1>

    <p>
      From time to time, the FSF Europe issues a newsletter that summarises its
      most important activities.
    </p>

    <p>
      The newsletters are published via our
      <a href="/press/index.html">press release mailing lists</a> which you can
      subscribe to if you want to receive the newsletters per mail.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page lists the newsletters that have been published in the past.
      There is another page containing an archive of
      <a href="news.html">regular news items</a>.
