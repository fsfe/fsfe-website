<h1>Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA)</h1>

<!-- <h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>A Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA) is an agreement between the owner of
a copyright and a fiduciary. The FLA a transfers some of the right of use
from the copyright owner to the fiduciary. Other than a collecting society the
FLA is about <i>grouping</i> the interests of the copyright owners at the
fiduciary (and not the distribution of the product).</p>

<p>The usage of a software is governed by a license agreement.
Free-software-projects usually have more than one copyright owner who work
collaboratively on that project. In case there happens a violation of the 
license agreement this distributed copyright might cause problems because in 
case of a lawsuit all the copyright owners may need to be present.</p>

<p>The FLA bundles all the rights of the copyright owners at the fiduciary. He 
can then effectively push the interests of the copyright holders in court.</p> -->

<h3>Why would I need FLA?</h3>

<p>Development of Free Software can follow many patterns. In some cases whole development is handled by sole programmer or a small group of people. But more often, creation and maintenance of software is a complex process encompassing many individuals. This also reflects on who owns the rights in software. In the latter case, rights in software are owned jointly by a great number of individuals.</p>

<p>To tackle this issue some projects require a full copyright assignment to be 
signed by all contributors. The problem with such assignments is often that 
they lack check and balances that would protect the contributors from 
potential abuse of power from the new copyright holder.</p>

<p>The Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA) was created just with that in mind – to 
concentrate all deciding power within one entity and prevent fragmentation of 
rights on one hand, while on the other preventing that single entity from 
abusing its power.</p>

<p>Solution is so-called <i>Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA)</i>. This technique makes it possible to concentrate all the deciding power within one entity and prevent fragmentation of rights.</p>

<p>This process only serves for transfer of economic rights. So-called moral rights (e.g. authors right to be identified as author) remain with original author and are inalienable.</p>

<h3>How does FLA function?</h3>

<p>FLA is an agreement between two parties - on the one side is an individual who contributed to software and therefore is co-author (<i>Beneficiary</i>), the other party is entity - it might be natural person but also company or organization - who will be the new holder of rights (<i>Fiduciary</i>). This way the fragmentation of rights among many contributors can be prevented. Instead all the rights will be concentrated in one entity. It ensures, that copyright-relevant modifications (aforementioned re-licensing) can be done easier, without need to pin down all contributors.</p>

<p>Beneficiary does not lose all his rights. While he transfers his exclusive rights to Fiduciary, Fiduciary reciprocally grants him a non-exclusive worldwide, perpetual and unrestricted license to same extent as it was original transferred from Beneficiary.</p>

<h3>What if fiduciary misuses the rights I gave him, e.g. he re-licenses free software as a proprietary one?</h3>

<p>FLA offers a special clause for this kind of situation to protect the Free Software project against potentially malicious intentions of Fiduciary. According to this provision, if Fiduciary acts against the principles of Free Software, all granted rights and licenses return to their original owners. That means he will be effectively prevented from continuing any activity which is contrary to principles of Free Software.</p>

<h3>Who can be Fiduciary?</h3>
<p>As was mentioned above, Fiduciary can be basically anyone, whether a natural person, company or organization. But before becoming a Fiduciary, it is always important to assess all the risks connected with becoming one. Being a Fiduciary is a responsibility that should not be underestimated.</p>

<h3>What is the FLA?</h3>

<p>The Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA) is a copyright assignment that allows
one entity to safeguard all of the code created for a project by consolidating
copyright (or exclusive exploitation rights) to counteract copyright
fragmentation.</p>

<p>This enables projects to protect their legal maintainability by preserving
the ability to relicense code and ensuring sufficient rights to enforce
licences in court. The person assigning does not lose their rights to the
code either, as the FLA gives back unlimited usage/single exploitation rights
to the author. The FLA also applies a set of principles for the fiduciary.
If they breach these principles, all grants and licenses made to them
automatically expire.</p>

<p>Benefeciaries of the FLA assign the copyright in their work, and in 
countries where assignments of the copyright in a work are impossible, 
they grant the fiduciary an exclusive license (see §1(1) for details). 
Therefore, the FLA is designed to work in both civil and common law countries.</p>
