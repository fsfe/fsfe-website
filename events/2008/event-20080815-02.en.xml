    <title>Fellowship meeting in Vienna</title>
    <body>
      On 15 August 2008, a Fellowship meeting takes place in Vienna.
      We meet around 18:00 in the Library Room at the Metalab, Rathausstra√üe 6,
      first district. The discussions will start at 19:00.<br/>
      Items on the agenda include preparations for Shane Coughlan's visit to
      Vienna, the Software Freedom Concert on Software Freedom Day, and the
      "Linuxwochenende" event in Vienna in September. As always,
      the meeting is ended with a nice chat over a beer.<br/>
      As usual, this invitation addresses to all people interested in FSFE or
      Free Software. We are looking forward to many attendants!
