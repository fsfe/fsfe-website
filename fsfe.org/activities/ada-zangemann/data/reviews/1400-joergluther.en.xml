    "Even as a non-child, I was captivated by the story from the first 
    page to the last. Kudos to the author for packaging difficult 
    topics such as monopolies, lobbyism, digital divide, software 
    freedom, digital autonomy, IoT, consumer control, e-waste and much 
    more in a child-friendly form in an easily understandable and 
    exciting storyline."
