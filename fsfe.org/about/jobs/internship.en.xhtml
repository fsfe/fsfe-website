      The FSFE is a charity dedicated to empowering users to control technology. We
      are working to build freedom in digital society. We operate in a lively
      environment of numerous volunteers from many countries and several
      full-time employees.

          My eleven months as trainee and part of the FSFE's international team,
          have been full with new things to learn, great people to meet,
          challenges to overcome and opportunities to grasp. There was never a
          boring day. I was involved in high-level legal and policy work as well
          as community building and awareness-raising activities. I was in the
          core preparation team of short and long-term campaigns.

          Being part of the FSFE team has not only contributed to my professional development,
          but also to my personal development. Professionally, I have improved my research,
          communication, writing, planning, and digital skills through the various tasks I have
          completed during my internship. On a personal level, I have enjoyed working and interacting
          with the diverse and international nature of the staff, improving my knowledge of politics,
          culture, food, to name a few. I am glad that I got to share the day with such an amazing staff.

    <li>Compensation: Interns receive a compensation corresponding to the currently
      applicable statutory minimum wage for a full-time job (~1880 â‚¬ gross as of

        <p>
          With my internship at the Free Software Foundation Europe, I was given
          the opportunity to work together with amazing and highly motivated
          people. I could bring in my existing skills in a meaningful way, as
          well as learn a whole lot of new technical methods and ways to enthuse
          people. In my usual field of statistics and data analysis, Free
          Software and Open Data becomes increasingly important and is a key to
          privacy-friendly and ethical Data Science, which is why I am so
          delighted to be able to contribute to the work the FSFE is doing.

  <h2>Who we're looking for</h2>
  <p>
    The FSFE interns come from a variety of backgrounds, all sharing a passion 
    for technology, policy, and the legal issues surrounding them. If you're 
    interested in diving into these topics, you've come to the right place. 
    You're fired up about a free information society, and you've already done something to tell others
    why freedom matters? Then this internship is for you. Your academic
    background and qualifications matter less than your experience,
    willingness to learn, and ability to get things done. We expect:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Solid basic knowledge of and strong interest in Free
      Software (required).
    </li>
    <li>
      Fluent in English (written and spoken) is required;
      a working knowledge of other languages is an asset.
    </li>
    <li>
      Basic acquaintance with working on GNU/Linux systems (desirable)
    </li>
    <li>
      Ability to be creative, responsible, and to multitask.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ability to integrate into a young, motivated, and professional team.
    </li>
    <li>
      No programming skills required. Programming is one of the
      few things you probably <i>won't</i> be doing during your
      internship, unless you're applying for a technical
      internship.
    </li>
    <li>At the FSFE we value diversity and acknoeledge the difficulties women*, BPoC, Trans*, people with disabilities, people with a history of migration, and people from other underrepresented groups face in the IT world. Therefore we want to emphasise, that we particularly welcome applications from people who are underrepresented in the Free Software movement and the IT environment.</li>
  </ul>

      <div>
        <p>
          I am passionate about Free Software and I always wanted to help with
          its promotion. That's why an offer to help the FSFE was a perfect fit
          for me. During my internship, I worked mostly on developing the FSFE's
          infrastructure and helped by adding documentation for specific tasks
          involving different services. Interns at FSFE are really useful, as
          they bring their experience and knowledge to the FSFE and, given the
          structure and openness of the organisation, are able to do meaningful
          work that has a real value.
