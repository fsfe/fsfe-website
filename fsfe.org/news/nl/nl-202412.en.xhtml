<h1>Hearing at the Bundestag +++ Ada Premiere in German +++ REUSE and NGI updates4</h1>

<p>
As the last month of the year rolls in, thoughts of 2025 are already 
taking shape. But before we dive into the new year, December is packed 
with news! We are participating in a hearing at the German Parliament, 
we keep pushing for long-term funding for Free Software, new versions of 
REUSE Specification and REUSE tools were released, and more!</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Bram was not just VIM's lead maintainer but a true champion of open source values,
		collaboration, and innovation of VIM. He showed so much passion and 
		dedication over more than 30 years to build and improve the original 
		VI, making it a highly configurable and popular editor in the UNIX, 
		hacker, and node culture. But he wasn't only a developer and 
		benevolent dictator for life, he built up a community that continues 
		to grow, and support each other, and strive for excellence. We know 
		that none of this would be possible without the great work that Bram 
		created.”</p>

<h3 id="policy">German Bundestag hearing on “Open Source”</h3> 
<p>On Wednesday, 4 December  at 14:15, Alexander Sander will participate in 
the hearing on "Open Source" at the German parliament in Berlin. Alex 
will present the position of the FSFE, answering the questions of the 
Members of the German Bundestag.</p> 
<p><a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/cMMF6DCiLB9RncdL46KCNb">Follow the hearing live 
(in German)</a></p>

<h3 id="ngi">Policy and EU: the need of long-term funding </h3> 

<p>Last September, the FSFE called on the community to participate in a 
consultation on the European Union’s Digital Europe Programme and 
demanded long-term sustainable funding for Free Software after recent 
budget cuts. Results show the success of the call: they show that <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20241113-01.html">the FSFE’s call 
to action, based on our answers, was heard</a>. Nearly 800 answers were 
received, an unusually high number for such consultations.</p>

<p>This is also the topic of <a href="/news/podcast/episode-26.html">our latest Software Freedom podcast 
episode</a>. On SFP 26, we focus on the 27 million euros cut from funding of 
the Next Generation Internet initiative (known as NGI). Alexander 
Sander and Bonnie Mehring shed some light on the history of this 
European project and share the newest developments in this case.</p>

<h3 id="reuse">REUSE makes software licensing as easy as one-two-three</h3> 

<p><a href="/news/2024/news-20241114-01.html">REUSE Specification 3.3 and 
REUSE tool 5.0.0</a> were released in 
November, making it even easier to license your code as Free Software. 
REUSE provides all the tools and documentation that developers need to 
apply standards-compliant and comprehensive licensing information to 
their projects, without needing to be legal experts.</p> 

<h3 id="ada">Ada &amp; Zangemann German premiere and more!</h3> 

<p>On 27 November,  800 guests, most of them children, enjoyed the 
German premiere of our animated film “Ada &amp; Zangemann - A fairy tale 
about software, skateboards and raspberry ice cream”, screened in the 
biggest cinema in Germany. Check out some <a 
href="https://pics.fsfe.org/gallery/5Tcc_rbuFkkT5FWB9xd3jSAK">pictures 
from the premiere</a>.</p>

<p>
The movie is now available, together with the English version, in <a 
href="https://ada.fsfe.org/movie">ada.fsfe.org/movie</a>.
</p>

<p>This month we have also released, thanks to our Italian volunteers, 
this story as an <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/3gkJp3EENfs1WkbXfPrvCt">audio book in 
Italian</a>. And we have continued with the readings, in Italy, <a 
href="https://grundschuleoberweier.de/detail/nachricht/id/19720-vorlesetag-in-oberweier/?cb-id=22679">rural 
Germany</a>, and even <a 
href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7260969487418470400/">in 
Sri Lanka</a>!</p>

<p>More great news! And Ada made it into the <a 
href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Motd/2024-11">Wikimedia 
Commons media of the day</a> on 10 November! The story of Ada also was 
promoted in the <a href="">Autumn edition (number 23)</a> [DE] of the 
Evangelical parents' magazine "Zehn14".</p>

<h3 id="sfscon">SFSCON ‘24</h3> <p>At the beginning of November, the 
 FSFE team travelled to Bolzano to take part in SFSCON. It was a really 
 nice few days full of interesting talks and discussions. We also had 
 the chance to go on a sunny hike with our volunteers the day after 
 SFSCON!</p>

<p>During SFSCON, the FSFE and Linux User Group Bolzano-Bozen 
(LUGBZ) <a href="/news/2024/news-20241108-01.html">posthumously honored 
Bram Moolenaar</a>, creator of the widely used 
Vim text editor, with the European SFS Award.</p>

<p>Besides our booth there, with really nice and cool merchandise such as our new Ada cookie 
cutters or our temporary FSFE tattoos, our team was also involved 
giving talks and organizing workshops.</p>

<p>We prepared a <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/p/aEecP2aE1zRrVYN7ERw9ZS">playlist with 
our talks</a> for you to learn first hand 
about topics such as openwashing, CRA and PLD liability rules, the EU 
NGI initiatives and the need of long-term funding, our experience with 
the Italian community, and introduction to the fediverse ... and more.</p>

<h3 id="prize">Humboldt Prize for a Free Software Master’s Thesis</h3> 
<p>The Humboldt University of Berlin has granted the <a 
href="https://www.hu-berlin.de/de/ueberblick/menschen/ehrungen/humboldtpreis/archiv/humboldt-preis-2024/humboldt-preis-2024">Humboldt 
Prize - Research for Innovation 2024"</a> to Linda Novobilska for her 
master's thesis on <a 
href="https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/items/761ad9ba-a865-4635-8e93-e7ce60e950a9">"Free 
and Open Source Software Licensing Requirements 
and Copyright Infringement Involving Artificial Intelligence 
Technologies"</a>. The thesis was co-advised by Dr Lucas Lasota, FSFE’s 
Legal Programme Manager.</p> 

<p>This master’s thesis represents a successful 
attempt to systematically analyse the licensing requirements of open 
source software in relation to AI technologies. The thesis has shed 
light on the latest developments in copyright law and provides deep 
insights into recent litigation in the USA.</p>

<p>The Humboldt Innovation Prize is a prestigious award for outstanding academic work by students 
and junior researchers. The winners are granted 1000 EUR and coaching 
sessions from the Humboldt Start-Up Innovation Management.</p>
