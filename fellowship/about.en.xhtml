    <h3>Local meetings</h3>

    <p>
      <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/FellowshipGroup">Active Fellowship
        groups</a> are emerging in more and more European cities.  These
      groups allow Fellows from an area to meet and get to know one
      another.  Groups undertake activities ranging from a comfortable
      beer to running public awareness <a
        href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/FellowshipEvents">events</a>.
    </p>
