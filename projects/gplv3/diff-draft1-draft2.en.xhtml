  Below is a side-by-side comparison of discussion draft 1 and
  discussion draft 2 of GNU GPL version 3.  Text that was in the first
  draft but which is not in the second draft is in <span
  style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">bold red</span> in the left
  column, and text which is new in the second draft is in <span
  style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">bold blue</span> in the right
  column.  The section numbers used in version 2 of the GNU GPL are
  shown in square brackets.
