		<body> 
			<p>Les Rencontres Mondiales du Logiciel Libre (Libre Software Meeting) are a series of freely accessible conferences, workshops, and round tables on Libre Software and its uses. This event takes place in a different city each year since 2000. Gathering a crowd of thousands, the 17th Libre Software Meeting will take place for the first time in the city of Saint-Etienne, located in the region of Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes (France) from the 1st to the 7th July, 2017. As a global event, speakers from all over the world come to present and discuss their projects with an attentive and large audience. Beyond free software, other domains sharing the same concept of freedom will be present, such as free hardware (Hackerspace, Fablab,...) and artistic creation under free licences (graphism, music, cinema...). </p>
