    <h1>No Cloud</h1>

    <div id="introduction">
		<p>
			Because it enables a constant availability of the ressources, an easy backup solution and a simple way to share our data, we put everything in the "cloud": music, videos, documents, private emails,... All our data is available from everywhere we want and that is really useful. But, who is really able to say where is this data now? "On the cloud". Yes, but where is this cloud? Where is **your** data? Who owns it now?
		</p>
		<p>
			The goal of FSFE's no cloud campaign is to give people awareness on this problematic. A real cloud is nice, a real cloud is poetic, but, in computing, "cloud" is nothing more than a commercial name: there is no cloud, just other's people computers, and your data is surely stored somewhere on them.

    </div>
    
    <h2>About other's people data</h2>
    
    <p>Businesses and public administrations have to process other's people data. To store this data related to consumers and/or citizens in the "cloud" is potentially the same than giving it to another company that does no respect the same legislation. To be sure to respect data protection standard, FSFE encourages public bodies, businesses and also individuals to use its own cloud solution -- based on <a href="/about/basics/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> and <a href="/activities/os/def.en.html">Open Standards</a> -- on its own servers. It would enable security, transparency, interoperability and privacy protection.</p>
