    <title>GNU/LinuxTag in Karlsruhe, Germany</title>
    <body>
      GNU/LinuxTag is one of the major Free Software events. Like every year,
      the FSF Europe will man a booth. Several of our team members will be
      there to answer questions about our activities, and we will sell
      merchandise like t-shirts and pins for the benefit of our work for Free
      Software.
