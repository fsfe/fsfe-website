    <title>No software patents in Europe, FSFE requests EPO review instrument</title>
    <body>
After years of struggle, the European Parliament finally rejected the
software patent directive with 648 of 680 votes: A strong signal

European Union and a clear request for the European Patent Office
(EPO) to change its policy: the EPO must stop issuing software patents
today.
