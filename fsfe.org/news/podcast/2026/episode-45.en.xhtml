<h1>SFP#45: The final chapter of the EU Radio Equipment Directive</h1>

<p>
What can be better while travelling to FOSDEM than to listen to the (hopefully) final chapter of the EU Radio Equipment Directive (RED)? In this 45th SFP episode Alexander Sander and Bonnie Mehring are discussing the RED with their former colleague Max Mehl.

<p>
Together, Alex, Bonnie, and Max, unfold the history of the Radio Equipment Directive and the latest developments in regard to this regulation. The FSFE's involvement started when Max, back then in 2015 a working student for the FSFE, printed all the pages of this directive on the university printer and sat down to read through them word by word. In the document he marked the Article 3(3)i as problematic as it threatens the installation of Free Software on radio devices, like routers or smart home technologies. Since then, he continued to work towards safeguarding Free Software on radio devices.
</p>

<p>When Max took the next step in his career in 2022, Alex took over the work and continued, together with the help and insights of Max, to keep working towards software freedom and device neutrality, allowing users to install Free Software on radio devices. Now in 2025 the Radio Equipment Directive and the drafting of the delegated act for the Article 3(3)i have reached their final stage. Listen to our 45th episode to find out more!
