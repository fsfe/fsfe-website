    FSFE publishes expert brochure about “Public Money? Public Code!"
  </h1>

  <p newsteaser="yes">Why should governments develop Free Software? Where is Free Software already generating benefits in the public sector? What are Free Software business models? Answers to these questions and practical guidelines are given in the new expert policy brochure published today by the Free Software Foundation Europe. With decision-takers in mind, the brochure is produced to address candidates for the upcoming European Parliaments elections.

  <p>Today, and in preparation for the upcoming European election campaigns, the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) releases its policy brochure, <strong>"Public Money Public Code - Modernising public infrastructure with Free Software"</strong>.  This brochure aims to answer decision-takers' questions about the benefits of using and developing Free Software for public administrations. To help understand the important role that public procurement plays in this, the brochure presents an overview of EU Free Software projects and policies, uncovering legislation on software procurement. </p>

  <p>The brochure evaluates the modernisation of public infrastructure with using Free Software from the perspectives of academia, law, business, and government. Expert articles, reports, and interviews help readers to understand the opportunities for Free Software in public administration. For decision-takers, practical guidance is provided to move forward and start modernising public infrastructure with Free Software.</p>
  
	<blockquote>FSFE President Matthias Kirschner states: <em>"Free Software licences have proven to generate tremendous benefits for the public sector. This is not a trend that will pass, but rather a long-term development that is based on very positive experiences, and strategic considerations resulting from serious vendor lock-in cases in the past. In a few years, Free Software licences could become the default setting for publicly financed IT projects. The Free Software Foundation Europe watches these developments very carefully and we want to contribute our knowledge to support the public sector in this transition."</em></blockquote>


  <p>First steps for making Free Software licenses the default in publicly financed IT projects are outlined in the brochure. Other topics cover competition and potential vendor lock-in, security, democracy, "smart cities", and other important contemporary debates. The language and examples used have been specifically chosen for readers interested in politics and public administrations.
