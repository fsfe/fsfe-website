<h1>TUX&amp;GNU@school - 7th edition</h1>
<p><i>More or less regularly the column <a href=
"http://www.unormal.org/alis/tagatschool7.en.html">TUX&amp;GNU@school
[2]</a> reports about free software, a homepage on topic and an
easy to implement idea. This month I talk about <a href=
"http://www.kalzium.org/">Kalzium [3]</a>, a free chemistry
education program, about the homepage of <a href=
"http://www.schoolforge.net">OFSET (Organisation for Free Software
in Education and Teaching) [4]</a>, and about the idea "An
extension for Kalzium" ;-).</i></p>
<p>Welcome to the seventh edition of TUX&amp;GNU@school.
Unfortunately it's still not possible to receive the column as a
newsletter. Though I will try to make it possible till the next
edition. Furthermore I want to devote this edition to a very
valuable member of the Swiss (and international) Free Software
community, Mathias 'turrican' Gygax, who left us far to early.</p>
<h3>Kalzium - The Periodic Table of the Elements (PTE)</h3>
<p><a href="http://edu.kde.org/kalzium">Kalzium [3]</a> is a piece
of free education software (GNU GPL) from the <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org">KDE Edutainment project [5]</a> and shall
first and foremost offer a simple access to the Periodic Table of
the Elements (PTE). I tested the version 0.5 (KDE 3.1.5) on the
'testing' version of <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian
GNU/Linux [6]</a>.</p>
<p>After the first invocation of the program you see the beloved
(or hated) Periodic Table (see screenshot 1). Some of you will feel
reminded of their chemistry lessons in school days. All the
presently known (state 2002) chemical elements are listed simply
and clearly. A simple mouse click on one of these over 100 buttons
further information about the selected element appear. Then a new
window is opened which is devided in three sections containing
information in a general way (as name, symbol, atomic weight or
density), about the state of matter (melting and boiling point) and
about energies (ionisation energy and electronegativity).</p>
<p>As you see in screenshot 2, which shows this information for the
element Iron, there is a button labelled with "Web Lookup" too.
Through this you can reach the website of the University of Split
which displays further information about the corresponding element
in a new window. This information is displayed in one of the
following five languages: <a href=
"http://www.ktf-split.hr/periodni">Croatian [7]</a>, <a href=
"http://www.ktf-split.hr/periodni/de">German [8]</a>, <a href=
"http://www.ktf-split.hr/periodni/fr">French [9]</a>, <a href=
"http://www.ktf-split.hr/periodni/en">English [10]</a> and <a href=
"http://www.ktf-split.hr/periodni/it">Italian [11]</a>.
Incidentally you change this setting through the menu bar
<i>Settings -&gt; Configure Kalzium...</i> and there in the item
<i>Web Lookup</i>.</p>
<p><img src="./img/kalzium.en.png" alt=
"Screenshot 1: Kalzium after the frist start" width="889" height=
"573" border="0" /></p>
<h5>Screenshot 1: Kalzium after the first start</h5>
<p>In this settings dialog you can change the <i>Colors</i> too.
But for what? For this we go again back to the main window (see
screenshot 1). The Periodic Table of the Elements, as perhaps still
some of you know, is divided in different groups which are
emphasized in different colors. In the tool bar you can choose
among the international usable groupings <a href=
"http://www.iupac.org">IUPAC (International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry) [12]</a> and <a href="http://www.cas.org">CAS
(Chemical Abstracts Service) [13]</a> or, for whom this is as
meaningless as for me, you can completely deactivate them. Further
on the PTE can be displayed by characteristics as <i>Acid
Behavior</i> or <i>State of Matter</i> or simply in <i>Blocks</i>
or <i>Groups</i> too. Now all these highlighting modes and their
different colors can be set to your preference in the above called
setting entry. This allows the teaching person to precisely
highlight what he or she is talking about right now.</p>
<p>In this tool bar a selecting menu is located too with the two
items <i>Complete</i> and <i>Mendeleev</i> which show two
"different" PTEs. And before we finally leave the tool bar of
Kalzium I want to say something about the time bar (rightmost).
After clicking on this button at the bottom of the Periodic Table
of the Elements a sliding controller appears which stands on 2002.
With this you can now go back in the history and see which elements
were already known at which point in time (whereas some elements
aren't discovered yet but only predicted). And as we are talking
about the sliders, in the tool bar you can select the display
according to the <i>State of Matter</i> and explore which element
are vapor, liquid or solid at which temperatures ;-).</p>

<h5>Screenshot 2: Information about the chemical element Iron</h5>
<p>Some of you perhaps already noticed the menu item <i>Quiz</i>.
Chosen this item you can decide how many questions are asked to you
and then you can enjoy a little quiz. From my school days I
remembered at least that much that I mostly reach above 50 percent
of correct answers ,although, as regular readers of this column
know, my love to chemistry isn't that far reaching. Left of this
quiz through the menu item <i>Calculations</i> you reach a simple
calculation window (KMol) where simple formulas for calculations of
the molecular weight (Mw in u) can be entered. By the way this tool
can handle all the elements.</p>
<p>According to Carsten Niehaus, the author of this program,
Kalzium is suitable for all ages and students. A colleague of mine,
who studies <a href="http://www.mat.ethz.ch">materials [14]</a> at
the <a href="http://www.ethz.ch">ETHZ (Swiss Federal Institut of
Technology Zurich) [15]</a>, uses this program relatively often.
According to the handbook of Kalzium Carsten is interested in bug
reports, new data and improvement proposals as well. You can write
and send them relatively easy through the menu item <i>Help -&gt;
Report bug...</i> (well preferentially in English). And because I
haven't got a good idea for this edition of TUX&amp;GNU@school till
now and I heard about a good one at a <a href=
"http://www.lots.ch">Free Software event [16]</a> last week, I want
to explain it right here (and sending it to Carsten as well of
course). If I remember correctly last week somebody asked me the
following: "Is it possible to simulate chemical reactions with
Kalzium?" I think the person meant what happens if e.g. you take a
carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms or more generally how does
oxygen and iron react together. As a non-chemist and a
not-often-programmer I don't know now how simple or impossible it's
to implement this but Carsten, this as a food for thought ;-). But
of course at this place a large thank you to you and your helpers
for this wonderful piece of free education software.</p>
<p>But now continues to the homepage or project of this edition
respectively.</p>
<h3>OFSET.org - Organisation for Free Software in Education and
Teaching</h3>
<p>This is the first time that the information this section is
based on is not entirely collected on the corresponding homepage.
But I asked some questions (borrowed of the <a href=
"http://www.brave-gnu-world.org">Brave GNU World [17]</a>) to a
person of this homepage/project too. For that reason thanks a lot
to Hilaire Fernandes of the OFSET for the detailed replies to the
questions. Some of you might know him as an important person in the
development of <a href="http://www.ofset.org/freeduc-cd">Freeduc
[18]</a>, the GNU/Linux-LIVE-CD for schools and education.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ofset.org">OFSET - Organisation for Free
Software in Education and Teaching [4]</a> was founded at the end
of 1999 as an organisation according to the French law. The aim of
the OFSET is it to support and further the development of free
education software for education and teaching. Thereby it's
important that the whole thing happens as international as possible
therewith the work isn't made double and triple. Currently the
OFSET counts more than 40 members with a hard core of approx. ten
people. On the one hand the <a href=
"http://www.ofset.org/members/members.html">members [19]</a> are
developers programming busily themselves, in the other hand they
are e.g. secondary school teachers with whom they practise active
exchange of ideas concerning education software. The activities of
the organisation are supposed to speak to not only students and
programmers but also parents, teachers and whole schools.</p>
<p>For the concrete development of free education software the
OFSET gives some guidelines concerning the deployed tools which you
can read at their <a href=
"http://www.ofset.org/information/legal/charter.html">charta
[20]</a>. They always start programming from the user interface
which clearly is supposed to stand in the centre of their software
development. Internationalization is aspired where it seems useful,
translation and documentation at the places where it's feasible and
people are available. The scriptability is another point where the
members of the OFSET attach importance to. Therein they see a good
possibility to give the prospective users a tool for the adaptation
which seems to be central for free software. Currently they use C,
C++, Python and Scheme as programming languages, but they does not
have to limit oneself to these. They always use the <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#TOCGPL">GNU GPL [21]</a>
and the <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#TOCFDL">GNU FDL [22]</a>
as licenses.</p>

<h5>Screenshot 3: Front page of the homepage of the OFSET</h5>
<p>The current status of some <a href=
"http://www.ofset.org/projects/supported/supported.html">projects
of the OFSET: [23]</a> <a href=
"http://www.ofset.org/gcompris/">GCompris [24]</a>, which hopefully
is already know by some readers and whose author is a member of the
OFSET too, reached version 5.2 (at the moment of the interview with
Hilaire, the 16th October 2003, it stands at version 4.0). <a href=
"http://www.ofset.org/drgeo/">DrGeo [25]</a>, a free geometry
education program which exists since the foundation of the
organisation stands with version 0.9.9 at the barrier to the famous
and notorious 1.0. Further out of the countless education software
productions a new subproject has arosen which is supposed to make
contents (e.g. sounds and pictures) for education software
exchangeable among the projects. To the best of my belief <a href=
"http://www.ofset.org/assetml/">AssetML [26]</a> is currently
inserted by GCompris and <a href=
"http://childsplay.sourceforge.net">Childsplay [27]</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the solid legal basis of the OFSET the collaboration
with the <a href="http://www.unesco.org">UNESCO [28]</a> in the
last version of <a href="http://www.ofset.org/freeduc-cd">Freeduc
[18]</a> (Freeduc 1.4.1 in November 2003) was much easier. Not to
be ignored is the collaboration with other projects in this
environment as for instance <a href=
"http://www.skolelinux.org">Skolelinux [29]</a> or <a href=
"http://wims.unice.fr">WIMS [30]</a>. But of course the OFSET has
got "other projects in preparation but it is to soon to talk about
these ones".</p>
<p>As an answer to my question, what they have for special
problems, Hilaire answered shortly: "No, only solutions ;-)."
Nonetheless the OFSET can need helpers of course. Besides
developers they also search translators, documentaion writer and
people who represent the OFSET at Free Software events. Currently
they miss e.g. a primary school teacher who could take over the
documentation of GCompris. Automatically generated <a href=
"http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org [31]</a> documents are
already there, they only have to be filled. Interested people can
simply send an email to <a href="mailto:ofset@ofset.org">ofset at
ofset dot org [32]</a>. As a project for the somehow more distant
future the OFSET strives to receive the RIP label for their
software which is franchised by the French Education Office and
serves as a quality label and increase.</p>
<p>If you want to get more information about the OFSET, the best
place to go is the <a href="http://www.ofset.org">homepage of the
OFSET [4]</a> (English and French). Interesting pieces are the
<a href=
"http://www.ofset.org/information/legal/statutes.html">statutes
[33]</a>, the already called <a href=
"http://www.ofset.org/information/legal/charter.html">charta
(guidelines) [20]</a> or the <a href=
"http://www.ofset.org/information/legal/manifesto.html">manifesto
[34]</a> of the OFSET. At this place and at the end of the
presentation of the OFSET I want to wish you good luck for your
further work.</p>
<p>But now let's go to the today's idea - rubbish, I presented it
already above - then to the news.</p>
<h3>News and up to date program versions</h3>
<p>As an improvement I want to incorporate here news from other
internet pages. For the moment these are news from <a href=
"http://edu.kde.org">edu.kde.org [5]</a> and <a href=
"http://www.osfet.org">ofset.org [4]</a>. Because this is the first
time I'll include all news from the beginning of 2003. The messages
from these pages are taken here one to one or translated
respectively. The "I" in the edu.kde.org-news is refers to
Anne-Marie Mahfouf by the way. If you have further proposals send
<a href="mailto:foxman@lugo.ch">me [1]</a> an email please. Of
course there will still be other news.</p>
<h4>QtForum contest includes KDE programs <i>(<a href=

<p>The QtForum announced today that its <a href=
"http://contest.qtforum.org/rules.php">contest [35]</a> is now open
to KDE applications. The changes is as follow: "This folder must
contain the source code to the program and, in source form, any
code upon which it depends. As an exception, kdelibs version 3.2 or
later stable releases are allowed as external depency." I was meant
to be judge in that contest but I resigned from this position in
order to allow entries of programs in which I helped. I will not
present any of my own applications though, having had prior
knowledge of the contest. I wish you all good luck if you enter the
contest and I hope that new applications will soon join our
module!</p>

<p><a href="http://edu.kde.org/kard">Kard [49]</a> is a Memory-like
game for young children. You have some cards on a grid and you must
match the cards by pairs. The number of cards varies from 4 to 24
(multiples of 4). Kard is currently in the kdenonbeta module. At
the moment, there are only 2 themes which are colors and objects
related to a house. It would be nice to get more pictures for Kard.
For example, I have in mind pictures of musical instruments that
would be associated with the corresponding instrument sound.
Another level would be the sounds without any pictures. If you are
an artist or a would-be-artist, here is the way to be known! Please

more than 500'000 articles in most different world languages.
Wikipedia is a project of the <a href=
"http://www.wikimedia.org">Wikimedia Foundation [60]</a> which
contains several other projects too I want to talk about another
time. For the readers of TUX&amp;GNU@school the following numbers
will be the most interesting: <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">English Wikipedia [61]</a>
- 221'275 articles, <a href=
"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptseite">German Wikipedia [62]</a>

"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accueil">French Wikipedia [63]</a> -
29'009 articles and <a href=
"http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huvudsida">Swedisch Wikipedia
[64]</a> - 22'487 articles (State: 07.03.2004).</p>
<h4>Duden software for GNU/Linux too</h4>
<p>All software of the Duden publishing house (the Duden is the
standard work of the German language) is now also available for
GNU/Linux. First of all schools which want to change their IT will
be happy about this.</p>
<h4>QCad in version II released</h4>
<p>QCad, a free 2D CAD program, which I reported about in the
<a href="http://www.unormal.org/alis/tagatschool6.de.html">6th
edition of TUX&amp;GNU@school [65]</a> is being released in version
II. Although you don't see it instantly on the <a href=
"http://www.qcad.org">homepage [66]</a> QCad is still propagated
under the GNU GPL which the author reassured explicitly. Certainly
if you want a packaged and for your favorite distribution perpared
version you are allowed to spend some money to the project team.
Already packaged demo versions are available at the <a href=
"http://www.ribbonsoft.com/qcad_downloads.html">download page
[67]</a>.</p>
<h4>SelfLinux 0.10.0 published</h4>
<p>And right now the version 0.10.0 of the German project <a href=
"http://www.selflinux.org">Selflinux [68]</a> was published. It's
the aim of this project to simplify for novices the entrance to
this new world with numerous articles.</p>
<h4>Skolelinux is now an official subproject of Debian</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.skolelinux.org">Skolelinux [29]</a>, a
school distribution from Norway based on Debian, was joined with
the Debian subproject <a href=
"http://wiki.debian.net/DebianEdu">DebianEDU [44]</a>. Furthermore
the project goes slowly but safely to the version number 1.0 and
these is also the reason why the last prerelease pr46 is that
stable. All up to date versions are ready for downloading on the
<a href="ftp://developer.skolelinux.no/skolelinux-cd/">Skolelinux
FTP server [69]</a>.</p>
<h4>Oralux - Knoppix for blind people</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.oralux.org">Oralux [70]</a> is a LIVE-CD
distribution based on Knoppix for blind and visually impaired
people. At the startup firstly the hardware is automagically
detected and configured. After that the user is lead, controlled by
voice, through an entrance menu and thereafter to a working
environment with voice output. Currently they use <a href=
"http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net">Emacspeak [71]</a> for this. But
for the future they plan also to better integrate <a href=
"http://www.baum.ro/gnopernicus.html">Gnopernicus [72]</a>. Oralux
is available in the current version 0.05 at the <a href=
"http://www.oralux.org/download.php">download page [73]</a>. By the
way on Oralux 0.05 you'll find TUX&amp;GNU@school 6 in German as a
text for listing.</p>
<h4>Kalzium is getting rewritten</h4>
<p>As I saw just now at <a href=
"http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=11224">KDE-Apps.org
[74]</a> Kalzium shall be completely reworked and rewritten for the
version 1.0 (not yet released). It looks as we can be thrilled.</p>

<h4>About the author:</h4>
<p>Mario Fux finished 1999 the PrimarlehrerInnenseminar in Brig,
after which he then caught up on the mathematical and natural
scientifical matura. Currently he studies at the <a href=
"http://www.unizh.ch">university of Zurich</a> in the main subject
<a href="http://www.paed.unizh.ch">education (pedagogy)</a> and
<a href="http://www.ifi.unizh.ch/">computer sciences</a> as the
subsidiary subject. Together with two colleagues he founded the
<a href="http://www.edux.ch">"ALIS - Arbeitsgruppe Linux an
Schulen"</a> (Swiss work group for linux at school). And if he is
not spending his time in front of the PC, he sits at his nature
pond in the <a href="http://www.randa.ch">mountains</a>.</p>
