   <title>DFD @ EP: Open Standards in the Field of Encryption</title>
   <body>
<p>
Free speech is a human right, and a cornerstone of any democratic
society. To enable communication, it is important that documents can
be opened and read by the people who are meant to receive them. In
today's world, it is equally important that we have the ability to
ensure that documents are read only by the people meant to receive
them, to prevent a scenario where both censorship and self-censorship
degrade the ability of citizens to speak freely to each other, develop
new ideas, and drive the progress of our society.

<p>
For the fourth time, FSFE and the Greens/EFA group in the European
Parliament will celebrate Document Freedom Day together. The event,
which includes a presentation of the DebianParl project, will run from
13:30 to 16:00. Attendance is free of charge. Pre-registration is
required in order to enter the Parliament.
