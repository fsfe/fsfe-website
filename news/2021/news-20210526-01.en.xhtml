<h1>Call to apply for FSFE support for your local project</h1>
		
<p>It is no secret that the FSFE's activities are only possible with 
the priceless help of our contributors and supporters around Europe. In 
return we support local engagement financially, with our expertise, 
information material and networks. To help formalize this process, we 
run our next call for FSFE community projects.</p>
	
		
<p>From international campaigns to local information booths, our 
successful spreading of software freedom is based on many shoulders 
from active members within our community. This is why ever since the 
FSFE e.V. has been keen on supporting initiatives and activities from 
local FSFE groups to single supporters. If you currently look for 
financial funding for your FSFE activity, we are happy to support you.
