    <title>Open Platforms for Open Data? in Vienna, Austria</title>

    <body>
      <p>FSFE has launched the campaign “Public Money, Public code”, which promotes legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector is made publicly available under a Free and Open Source Software licence. The demand to support Free Software is also important for the open data debate. More and more administrations make open data available, which is used by different actors in different ways. However, these actors often resort to closed source solutions, which contradicts the idea of openness.</p>
      <p>At this event the FSFE Policy Manager, Alexander Sander will discuss challenges and contradictions with this model as well as provide ways forward on how to shape the open data debate in a way that systematically promotes the public interest.</p>
