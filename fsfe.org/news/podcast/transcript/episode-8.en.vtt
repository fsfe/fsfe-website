00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Dear listeners, I regularly talk to my mother about software freedom and general misunderstandings

00:06.000 --> 00:11.080
in this area, and this is why we had the idea for this podcast.

00:11.080 --> 00:16.200
We thought about the title and the implications it might have long and hard.

00:16.200 --> 00:22.700
To be clear, we do not believe that mothers or women need an explanation on technical

00:22.700 --> 00:27.280
topics more than fathers or men in general.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.160
For people who do not want to identify with any of those changes.

00:32.160 --> 00:39.000
But we wanted to talk about something real and not something invented just for the podcast.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.240
That's why we decided to do the podcast this way for all of you out there who sometimes

00:44.240 --> 00:49.240
struggle to explain their parents who are not that deep into technology what software

00:49.240 --> 00:50.760
freedom is.

00:50.760 --> 01:10.120
Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

01:10.120 --> 01:14.320
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe, where a charity

01:14.320 --> 01:17.560
that empowers users to control technology.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.760
I'm Matthias Kirschner, the president of the Free Software Foundation Europe, and I'm

01:20.760 --> 01:23.720
doing this podcast together with my colleague, Bernie Merring.

01:23.720 --> 01:24.720
Hello, Bernie.

01:24.720 --> 01:25.720
Hello, Matthias.

01:25.720 --> 01:29.120
Today, we are doing a special episode.

01:29.120 --> 01:34.280
We are doing an episode about how to tell my mother that free software can cost money.

01:34.280 --> 01:41.160
This idea came through our conversation because I regularly explain my mother, my passion

01:41.160 --> 01:45.760
about free software, and also talk to her about some calm misunderstandings.

01:45.760 --> 01:51.160
So we decided to do a special podcast episode for everyone out there explaining their parents

01:51.160 --> 01:53.000
how free software works.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.760
And that's what we will do.

01:54.760 --> 01:58.040
The first question was can free software cost money?

01:58.040 --> 02:02.480
How would you explain that free software can cost money?

02:02.480 --> 02:07.840
Hmm, difficult because I mean for myself, the situation was a little bit different.

02:07.840 --> 02:14.240
As when I started with free software was in the late 1990s and early 2000s then, I had

02:14.240 --> 02:17.520
to pay money to get free software.

02:17.520 --> 02:25.160
Like I paid money to get some KnolLinux CDs or DVDs and floppies and I pulled some money

02:25.160 --> 02:31.640
with friends and we bought them and then we either gave them around so that one of us can

02:31.640 --> 02:36.920
do the update, the other one can then do the update or when I had then a CD burner, I

02:36.920 --> 02:41.280
could then use that to duplicate the CD images.

02:41.280 --> 02:46.520
So we didn't have to wait till one of us was finished with it or if someone had to reinstall

02:46.520 --> 02:48.040
it again.

02:48.040 --> 02:57.480
So I think my mother, she saw very early that I had the need for money to get those CDs

02:57.480 --> 03:03.720
as we didn't have like fast internet connection at the time and so yeah, but if we go back

03:03.720 --> 03:09.000
and think about like how would I explain the topic now, I always first explain like

03:09.000 --> 03:10.880
what is free software.

03:10.880 --> 03:18.840
So yes, free software costs money and second, what is it that defines free software and

03:18.840 --> 03:24.920
then I always, I would explain like that free software gives you the right to use, study,

03:24.920 --> 03:30.840
share and improve the software and all of that has nothing to do with the costs.

03:30.840 --> 03:37.120
So it's just, it's important that the software enables you to use the software for any purpose

03:37.120 --> 03:44.360
that everybody, your mother, your father, other friends, colleagues and so on that they

03:44.360 --> 03:50.280
can use it for whatever they want to, second, that they can study how the software works.

03:50.280 --> 03:56.800
So if they want to, they could understand that a lot of people from you talk, they might

03:56.800 --> 04:01.600
not be interested in that, but they also benefit from other people looking into this.

04:01.600 --> 04:07.000
So friends of them who are more into technology, they would like to find out something they

04:07.000 --> 04:12.120
can better help others and explain them how technology works.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.800
Then that the, that you can share the software with others.

04:15.800 --> 04:24.880
So if, for example, you got some Knolynux city that you can pass it on to your mother without

04:24.880 --> 04:29.000
having to consider anything else about that.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.880
So you can just do that and that you can also make changes to the software and improve

04:34.880 --> 04:39.360
the software and adopt it to the need of whoever wants to use the software.

04:39.360 --> 04:44.320
So if your mother would like to have something different, you might be able to help her and

04:44.320 --> 04:48.320
make some small modifications to the software so she's able to do that.

04:48.320 --> 04:56.200
If it's a company, that's a bit more you have to do to make, to Feed to their needs maybe.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.840
So yeah, but, but that's something which is always possible for the software.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.600
So it's use, study, share and improve.

05:02.600 --> 05:10.440
And none of that is restricting if you can or if you should pay for the software.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.200
This was a really good answer.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.520
I did it a bit different.

05:14.520 --> 05:20.120
I just explained that you could also donate money for a free software and there are loads

05:20.120 --> 05:27.600
of projects out there which do need to help from people using the software and then I also

05:27.600 --> 05:29.080
went to the improved part.

05:29.080 --> 05:32.560
I explained to her, do you want to have a special feature?

05:32.600 --> 05:34.880
And this would be only for you.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.720
You could also pay somebody else to implement it.

05:38.720 --> 05:47.360
Yeah, so yeah, I mean, I, I rather preferred when I, when I explained it to others to talk

05:47.360 --> 05:50.000
about voluntary payment.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.440
If, if you don't have to pay for it, because you, you get quite a lot in return for it.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.200
You, you get, you get a software for it.

05:58.200 --> 06:02.760
It's not just that you donate money and they do something for someone else with it, but

06:02.760 --> 06:04.840
you benefit from it.

06:04.840 --> 06:11.640
And so, so I, I mean, the FSFE from the beginning, when we were founded in 2001, we encouraged

06:11.640 --> 06:15.600
people to pay for free software.

06:15.600 --> 06:21.240
Because we believe that it's important for the further development of free software and

06:21.240 --> 06:25.680
we think it's also for, for each individual out there, it's important that they give money

06:25.760 --> 06:32.680
to those who value their freedom and less money to those programmers who write software

06:32.680 --> 06:35.080
which restricts their freedom.

06:35.080 --> 06:40.480
So it's, whenever you have the possibility to pay for free software and you have the

06:40.480 --> 06:46.080
money to do so, we encourage people to actually pay.

06:46.080 --> 06:52.360
There are some, some other possibilities, like I mean, sometimes we get, we get questions

06:52.400 --> 06:58.560
like, oh, here in this, for example, in, in this app market, you have to pay for the

06:58.560 --> 06:59.560
software.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.280
So this cannot be free software.

07:01.280 --> 07:04.760
Well, that's, that's not the case.

07:04.760 --> 07:10.560
There is free software in app stores and you, you have to pay to download it.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.920
There are also other ways to somehow get the software, compile it yourself, put it on,

07:14.920 --> 07:16.480
on your, on your mobile.

07:16.480 --> 07:21.080
But actually, it's a very easy way for you to support the further development that you

07:21.080 --> 07:24.080
can also benefit from free software in the future.

07:24.080 --> 07:30.920
So I would always encourage people to, to pay for free software if it's somehow possible.

07:30.920 --> 07:39.440
Also for, like, my, for, for parents, it's, it's important to, to understand that, I mean,

07:39.440 --> 07:44.120
when, when I talk about that with my parents or with friends and relatives, I don't want

07:44.120 --> 07:48.120
them to have the impression that I am, I am working for software which everybody can

07:48.120 --> 07:52.640
just use free, of course, that's not, that's not what, what, what I'm working for.

07:52.640 --> 07:57.800
I'm working for software which, which respects the user's freedom, which is important for

07:57.800 --> 08:03.560
our society, which helps us to, to have a more just society in which I want to live

08:03.560 --> 08:09.240
in and not society where everybody gets everything for, yeah, great is.

08:09.240 --> 08:16.000
So that's why I make this point very often in conversations.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.400
As we now have talked about paying for free software, how do I pay the money for free software?

08:22.400 --> 08:24.920
So I mean, there, there are different ways.

08:24.920 --> 08:31.840
So in general, it's, it's not different than, uh, than with proprietary software.

08:31.840 --> 08:36.800
The only difference is that with free software, you don't pay for a license.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.680
But all the other means are the same.

08:38.680 --> 08:45.000
So for example, uh, you can pay for, for the medium, like, I did, uh, when, when I was,

08:45.000 --> 08:49.800
when, when I started with a software that you, yeah, that you, you buy the CDs, you go,

08:49.800 --> 08:55.640
uh, you either buy them online, uh, order them somewhere or, uh, you go to a book shop.

08:55.640 --> 09:00.800
That was also possible and you buy a box with, uh, with a book with the documentation and

09:00.800 --> 09:03.440
then some kind of Linux CDs and floppies.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.600
So, uh, that's something you can do.

09:05.600 --> 09:10.880
Like you could also go out and do the same with proprietary software, just that the software

09:10.880 --> 09:16.440
is then not respecting, uh, your freedom, uh, and with free software, you get the whole

09:16.440 --> 09:21.520
package and you are able to, you study, share and improve everything which is in this box.

09:21.520 --> 09:28.360
So the, the other possibility is that, for example, when you are using a mobile phone, uh,

09:28.360 --> 09:34.760
and you, you go to the, to the, uh, to the software where you install your, your apps, several

09:34.760 --> 09:39.200
of them, they have the possibility to also pay for the software there.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.360
So you pay before installation.

09:41.360 --> 09:47.840
That's, uh, that's true for, for proprietary app, um, app stores where you then can, can

09:47.840 --> 09:53.360
just pay two euros, something or five euros, something and then you can easily install

09:53.360 --> 09:59.840
the software on your, on your mobile and that's also, um, more and more possible with, uh,

09:59.840 --> 10:05.480
free software, app markets, for example, eftroid, uh, they, they had some option in there

10:05.560 --> 10:10.680
which enables you to donate and then now they are at the moment also improving this more

10:10.680 --> 10:16.600
and more that you can have certain payment options to, uh, give back money to, to those

10:16.600 --> 10:23.080
developing those apps. So that's one other part you, you pay before installation because I mean,

10:23.080 --> 10:28.920
you could also somehow, uh, install the software on your mobile phone in another way where you

10:28.920 --> 10:33.800
wouldn't have to pay for it, but you can do it more easily by, by paying for it and thereby

10:33.800 --> 10:40.280
also supporting the software developers in the long run. Then there's the possibility that you

10:40.280 --> 10:47.080
could give money, uh, to someone explaining the software to you like, uh, doing an educational

10:47.080 --> 10:52.920
course, uh, so that you better understand the software, uh, they developed, raise your questions

10:52.920 --> 10:57.720
there. I mean, you, you could go to seminar or an online seminar or an in-person seminar

10:57.800 --> 11:04.280
and pay for this. That they explain you, for example, how to use game and in-scape, uh, for, uh,

11:04.280 --> 11:10.120
improving your, your pictures or creating some graphics. That's something you can, you can do.

11:10.760 --> 11:16.680
There is, uh, of course, and also in the commercial area, you can also, uh, send your employees to

11:16.680 --> 11:24.200
one of those trainings. Then there are, uh, possibilities like that that you pay for, for the hardware,

11:24.200 --> 11:29.080
which is then combined with the software and thereby you also support, uh, the development of

11:29.080 --> 11:36.520
free software. For example, in the past, uh, I, I bought, uh, network attached storage. So one of

11:36.520 --> 11:42.840
those boxes, which you can have at home and then make sure that, uh, the music is shared with your,

11:42.840 --> 11:49.160
with your family again or the pictures you took from, from, uh, from family members is stored

11:49.240 --> 11:55.080
there in a more secure way than if it's just on some USB drive. And, uh, you, you can buy some

11:55.080 --> 11:59.800
out there, which are pre-installed with free software. And by doing that, you also support the

11:59.800 --> 12:06.200
for the development there. Another one is that, uh, when you buy, uh, laptop, which is pre-installed

12:06.200 --> 12:12.520
with, uh, with Linux or another free operating system, you're also supporting this. Or, uh, in the

12:12.520 --> 12:19.400
past, I also bought, uh, like, and it was called the OpenMocco, which was one of the, uh, the first,

12:19.400 --> 12:24.600
uh, free, free software phone out there. And thereby also supporting developers who are working in

12:24.600 --> 12:30.200
this area. So when, when you buy a hard, uh, certain hardware, people might also benefit from that.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.960
The, the other possibility then is that you, you buy certain services, which, uh, are run by the

12:37.960 --> 12:44.920
developers of the software. So, uh, for example, you could also set up your own backup, backup

12:44.920 --> 12:51.560
storage somewhere, install your own server and so on. But that's very complicated. And most likely,

12:51.560 --> 12:56.920
I mean, my parents wouldn't do that. But I could encourage them to, to pay for a backup service,

12:57.800 --> 13:02.440
from, from companies whom I know that they are also involved in free software development. And

13:02.440 --> 13:08.600
they are then providers out there who are also heavily, uh, developing the tools you, you would

13:08.600 --> 13:16.040
also else use to make your backups and encrypt that fashion. So that's one, one thing I, I always

13:16.040 --> 13:24.600
encourage people to do. Um, you could also like, uh, now if, uh, if people want to, to use, uh, like

13:24.600 --> 13:31.960
remote, um, video or audio solutions, uh, you could encourage them to buy this as a service from

13:31.960 --> 13:37.400
someone who, who, who runs this for you and you can, and you can thereby support, uh, the

13:37.400 --> 13:45.720
development of like Chitzi or a big blue button or, uh, or mumble as audio conference or, or

13:45.720 --> 13:51.240
something like for, for remote meetings, you, you could get that from, from, uh, like open slides.

13:51.240 --> 13:56.200
All of this, you, you can also install it on your own and you, you don't pay anyone for it.

13:56.200 --> 14:02.440
But if, if you do and you, you pay someone for it, then they can, uh, they can also make a living

14:02.440 --> 14:08.120
and further continue to, to develop a software which can then be used by everyone and under certain

14:08.120 --> 14:13.080
circumstances, you don't want to buy this service from them and run it on their server, but you,

14:13.080 --> 14:19.880
you would just like to run it in your own company and maybe also do that yourself. But still,

14:19.880 --> 14:25.400
it might be good for you to, to give, uh, money to that, uh, to that company that they can further

14:25.400 --> 14:31.720
develop it, which also brings us to the next, uh, to the next part. I mean, it's often something

14:31.720 --> 14:38.360
which for, for private people is not so easy to do, but for companies, you can also buy, like, uh,

14:38.360 --> 14:44.280
you can pay for support. Um, you, you just say, you give a certain amount of money to a company

14:44.280 --> 14:50.920
and they make sure that the software runs at 24 hours a day, seven, seven days a week. Or, I mean,

14:51.080 --> 14:58.200
in the case of, of your mother that she can, she can pay someone like you. And, uh, and whenever

14:58.200 --> 15:03.880
she has a problem, she knows that, uh, you can come, you can help her and, uh, and by this, she's

15:03.880 --> 15:09.960
then also supporting, uh, free software because you, you do some other work in this area and,

15:09.960 --> 15:14.680
and can further help to improve the software and there. So there are, there are lots of possibilities.

15:15.640 --> 15:25.400
Oh, yes. We conclude there are loads of ways to pay for free software. And what I also did is,

15:25.400 --> 15:33.800
I encouraged my mother to look at the project website and check out which way they would like to get

15:33.800 --> 15:40.520
some money. Yeah. So I mean, often, uh, for, for some smaller software, you often find that under,

15:40.600 --> 15:46.600
like, uh, to make a donation that you, that you can do it that way. But yeah, if, if you have some

15:46.600 --> 15:52.520
way of doing like subscriptions, uh, some, some of them offer subscriptions, um, some others, uh,

15:52.520 --> 15:58.280
as I said, uh, when they are apps, you can, you can pay on the, in the app market for it. So,

15:58.840 --> 16:05.880
also, if you, if you use, like, uh, if you use certain distributions, uh, where you then don't

16:05.880 --> 16:11.960
have to pay in while you install, as you said, it's good to, to then, uh, encourage people to

16:11.960 --> 16:18.040
think about, like, what is it worth? What I am getting here and how can I continue to support it?

16:18.040 --> 16:24.280
And actually, one, one good way is nowadays also that a lot of Linux distributions, when you,

16:24.280 --> 16:31.000
when you download them, you also have a way to, to pay for it. Like you often very voluntarily

16:31.080 --> 16:36.440
payment that we have some slider where you can decide how much you want to, to give to, to them.

16:36.440 --> 16:41.560
And for some of them, also, you can do a decided a little bit where the money should go, uh,

16:41.560 --> 16:48.120
and how much of the money you give them should be distributed. So in the past,

16:48.120 --> 16:53.240
I've also some community next distribution where you could join some, some club and have a membership

16:53.240 --> 16:59.160
fee there. And by that supporting the further development. I think that's very important because

16:59.160 --> 17:03.800
it's, it's, it's difficult to get good software for you as a private person.

17:04.440 --> 17:10.040
If developers don't make money with private people and they share with private users and they

17:10.040 --> 17:16.200
just make money with the, with the companies, then a lot of the software you as a private user

17:16.200 --> 17:21.880
will get is more like, yeah, we developed that for, for companies. And yeah, you can also use it

17:22.600 --> 17:29.000
as on your, on your private computer. As you know, I've mentioned the companies.

17:30.520 --> 17:36.280
How would you explain that are actually companies out there that earn their money with free software?

17:36.280 --> 17:43.400
I mean, very similar to what I just described. So, I mean, you, you have to, to develop software.

17:43.400 --> 17:50.520
And then there are certain ways on how they are paid for that. So either with, with the services,

17:51.480 --> 17:57.560
with, with education about the software, with making changes to the software because others want

17:57.560 --> 18:03.240
to have something a little bit different than what they have or I mean, also the other part that

18:03.240 --> 18:08.840
there isn't any software out there yet solving the problem for others. So someone asked the

18:08.840 --> 18:15.080
company if they could do that. So, and those are always what, how, how companies can then make

18:15.080 --> 18:21.400
money like with all the proprietary software out there as well. And then some companies they

18:21.400 --> 18:27.000
decided that they want to follow an ethical model or that some of their offerings are following an

18:27.000 --> 18:33.800
ethical model and that they do them as, as free software. I mean, that, that's probably also one,

18:33.800 --> 18:39.160
one, one part you should, you should consider there that it's often very difficult to say that one

18:39.240 --> 18:46.040
company is earning their money with free software because you should rather look at certain offerings

18:46.040 --> 18:49.880
the companies are doing and there are some offerings where they make money with free software.

18:49.880 --> 18:56.120
There are others where then they earn money with proprietary software and proprietary offerings.

18:56.120 --> 19:03.240
So there are a few companies out there who are really 100% just making free software offers.

19:04.120 --> 19:10.440
So that's that's something which which you always, which is it's better to to think about

19:10.440 --> 19:14.680
what of those offerings that the companies are doing offering software instead of thinking like

19:14.680 --> 19:22.440
which of the companies earn money just with free software. Do you have some examples of companies

19:23.240 --> 19:31.800
that do have free software products? For the FSV we always try to to be neutral and not make

19:31.800 --> 19:38.120
advertisement for for certain companies but the the things I mentioned at the beginning for

19:38.120 --> 19:43.640
example from from the different from different software out there. There are companies who provide

19:43.640 --> 19:49.480
services for that and with the backup solutions I said there are companies who develop those tools

19:49.480 --> 19:56.200
and when you and who make money who make money with then providing services on the free software

19:56.360 --> 20:07.320
they develop. So you say we should rather focus on the activity and not so much on our company itself

20:07.320 --> 20:13.000
because there are loads of companies out there. Yes exactly. The important part is more the activity

20:13.000 --> 20:18.680
and not the name of a company. Yes. So for example I would not like now to mention like there is

20:18.680 --> 20:24.040
this company and this is a free software company but I would rather say there are companies which

20:24.040 --> 20:29.960
are offering like take an example which is now very very interesting for a lot of people.

20:30.680 --> 20:37.640
There are companies out there who offer you to to run the free software cheatsy on their servers

20:37.640 --> 20:43.000
and when you when you buy this you're also contributing to developers and maintainers

20:43.000 --> 20:49.800
of the software and thereby helping free software offering to continue to exist and to improve

20:50.360 --> 20:55.800
and the same is then true for like if you stay with video conferences like big blue button then

20:55.800 --> 21:04.520
or audio you have then mumble or there is then other software out there for doing other

21:04.520 --> 21:13.720
remote activities. So basically there are many companies out there earning money with free software

21:13.800 --> 21:19.640
sending services for free software or supporting free software in any other way but

21:20.440 --> 21:25.800
there are also ways for individuals as we covered before but are there any other ways

21:26.600 --> 21:31.080
of earning money with free software or to get funding for free software.

21:33.560 --> 21:41.400
So yeah I mean there are there are some some public funds for this. So for example

21:42.200 --> 21:48.920
the FSFE is also involved in some funds there where governments or other institutions

21:49.480 --> 21:57.480
set up funds to pay or to support the development of free software. For example on the European level

21:57.480 --> 22:04.280
there is the NGI zero and so next generation internet research and innovation actions where

22:04.280 --> 22:11.080
there are two different programs where we as the FSFE are involved and you can you can apply there

22:11.400 --> 22:16.920
and you can get funding and then we as FSFE also help you to make sure that your licenses are

22:16.920 --> 22:21.800
compliant and that everything which comes out there is then really free software. So that's

22:21.800 --> 22:27.640
something that you you can apply for funding like this. There's also another program where we are

22:27.640 --> 22:34.200
in the advisory committee which is the NGI zero pointer program. So that's that's programs where

22:34.200 --> 22:41.000
the European institutions set up money to support free software development and on national

22:41.000 --> 22:47.960
basis for example in Germany I was several years in the in the jury of the prototype fund in

22:47.960 --> 22:54.120
Germany where you can apply as an individual or team and then develop a free software prototypes

22:55.560 --> 23:03.640
different areas and now this this program is also set up in in Switzerland and beside that

23:03.640 --> 23:09.640
there are also other grants out there where you can get funding to develop free software but

23:09.720 --> 23:17.640
that the ones I just mentioned they they have a strong focus on either it's it's mandatory that

23:17.640 --> 23:24.120
you publish your outcome as free software afterwards or that's a very very strong criteria.

23:26.840 --> 23:31.160
So do you think this would cover all the questions your parents would ever have about

23:32.840 --> 23:38.920
the cost for free software and how to pay for it and how to earn money with it or do you think

23:38.920 --> 23:42.920
there would be another question what would be a question that you parents would ask you.

23:46.520 --> 23:52.920
Difficult I'm pretty sure there were there were other questions maybe our listeners can can help

23:52.920 --> 23:58.760
us a little bit to remind us about some questions they received there. I think that a lot of the

23:58.760 --> 24:06.280
questions I which which I talked about with with friends and family that that they were mainly covered

24:06.360 --> 24:13.960
there then of course also some some other questions out there like how can you do very large

24:13.960 --> 24:19.480
innovative steps when you would like to do it with free software how does that work and

24:20.840 --> 24:27.800
some some other question about like competition with proprietary software and so on but I think that

24:27.800 --> 24:34.600
that's all that's awesome questions which which would then merit more like to have to talk about

24:34.680 --> 24:44.920
them in more depth so I think on the main level of friends and family conversations I think we

24:44.920 --> 24:52.840
covered most of the things I encounter now. Some people have some questions they often encounter

24:52.840 --> 25:00.040
yeah just send us an email to podcast at fsfe.org and we'll see if we can see that we we can talk

25:00.120 --> 25:08.040
about that another time. Perfect so we will do another episode and talk about some deeper questions.

25:10.920 --> 25:16.040
Thank you Matthias for giving me another perspective on how to answer those questions.

25:46.760 --> 25:51.560
and as we covered in this episode I would like to encourage you to also make payments to free

25:51.560 --> 25:56.520
software contributors out there to make sure that they can continue to develop free software

25:56.520 --> 26:01.400
which enables you to use study share and improve it for any purpose and thereby respecting your

26:01.400 --> 26:19.000
freedom. Thank you very much. Bye. Bye.
