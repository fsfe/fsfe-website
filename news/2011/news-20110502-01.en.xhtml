	<h1>FSFE provides input to EC on collective redress</h1>

	<p>On Friday, Free Software Foundation
	Europe asked the European Commission to create a legal
	avenue for citizens seeking collective redress against
	companies. In its <a
		href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/letters/20110429.CollectiveRedress.Response.FSFE.pdf">
		contribution</a> to a <a
		href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/redress_cons/collective_redress_en.htm#cr">public
		consultation</a> by the
Commision, FSFE argues that consumers should be able to join
forces in order to defend their rights against harmful business
practices.  </p>

	<p>"Collective redress" is a legal concept which allows
	citizens and businesses that are individually harmed by
	illegal behaviour of a given company to bundle their
	claims in a single procedure. Not only does this simplify
	the process and reduce costs. Since starting a lawsuit on
	a personal basis carries great financial risks, for most
	citizens collective redress is also the only realistic
	path to take legal action against bad business practices.
	</p>
	
	<p>
Being concerned with numerous complaints over pre-installed
Microsoft Windows operating system, FSFE has provided the EC with
its vision of the main principles for a collective redress
procedure which would make it easier and more effective for
consumers to act against monopolistic marketing practices. 
</p>

<p>
In March, FSFE <a href="/news/2011/news-20110321-01.en.html">announced its support</a> for the class action sought by Italian consumers association ADUC against Microsoft's persistent failure to reimburse unwanted operating system licenses which consumers had acquired together with computers.
