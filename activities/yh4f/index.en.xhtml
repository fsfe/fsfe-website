  <h1>Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</h1>

  <div id="introduction">
    <p><strong>
      If you like coding, tinkering, and having fun with software and if you
      are up for a challenge, we have something exciting for you: "Youth
      Hacking 4 Freedom" (YH4F), the FSFE's hacking competition for young
      people from Europe! 
    </strong></p>

  <h3>Who can participate?</h3>

  <p> 
    You are <em>born between 01.01.2002 and 31.12.2008</em>? You are up
    to hack on a software project of your choice? You want to get the chance to
    meet like-minded people, get one of our cash awards and be invited to
    Brussels to meet the other winners and great people from the Free Software
    movement? Then register <em>until 10 October 2021</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
	  We are dedicated to offering an inclusive environment in the 
	  YH4F, and we would like to encourage teenagers of all genders to 
	  join! We will make sure everyone will enjoy the process and will 
	  leave this competition with added knowledge and a smile. 
  </p>

  <h3>Decide yourself what you code</h3>

  <p> 
    The possibilities are endless! The only condition for the competition is
    that the program should be <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free
    Software</a>. We will show you how to label your program as Free Software
    at the beginning of the competition.
  </p>

  <h3>How much time do I have?</h3>

  <p>
    Register until 10 October 2021. After the kick-off event in October the
    coding phase begins at 15 October 2021 and ends at 30 April 2022. Then, our
    jury members will evaluate all submission. You are not expected to devote
    all this time into your project; you have seven months so that you can be
    flexible in your schedule. The Award Ceremony will take place in June 2022
    in Brussels (Belgium).
  </p>

  <h3>Who will evaluate the projects?</h3>

  <p> 
    From May on the evaluation phase is carried out by Free Software experts.
    <em><a href="/activities/yh4f/evaluation.html">Our jury
    members</a></em> excel in software development and are deeply involved
    in the Free Software movement.  Based on the jury’s grades, the winners are
    determined and announced.
  </p>

  <h3>What is the award?</h3>

  <p> 
    All of you should have fun during the competition, have the chance to
    briefly follow each other’s work, to exchange ideas, and to share
    problem-solving tips. Everyone who in the end submits a Free Software
    program will get a participation certificate. The first six places will be
    awarded with <em>cash between 1.024€ and 4.096€ each </em> and all winners
    will be invited to Brussels for the award ceremony to meet like-minded
    people in June 2022.
