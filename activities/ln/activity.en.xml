    <title>Legal Network</title>
    <description>
      The Legal Network is a neutral, non-partisan, group of experts in
      different fields involved in Free Software legal issues.
      Currently the Legal Network has several hundreds of participants
      from different legal systems, academic backgrounds and
      affiliations. The aim of the Legal Network is to promote
      discussion and foster better knowledge of the legal constructs
      that back Free Software. The conversations on the Legal Network
      are intended to be dynamic, thought-provoking and up to speed
      with the most recent developments. Since 2007, we have been
      conducting the annual Legal and Licencing Workshop (LLW) which
      has become the world’s foremost gathering of lawyers,
      technologists, and thought leaders on Free Software legal and
      licensing topics in an informal and confidential atmosphere.
