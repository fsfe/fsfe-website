  <h1>Protect your privacy - Help GnuPG hire a second developer!</h1>
  <p newsteaser="yes">
    GnuPG is the world's leading privacy tool, with an estimated user
    base of more than four million people world-wide, and a thousand
    new users each day. It guards emails, files, and programs from
    snooping and spying on Windows, Mac, and GNU/Linux. This crucial
    program needs your help to keep going in 2015 and beyond.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ongoing government spying revelations have shown how little of our
    information is really safe. GnuPG is one of the few tools that can
    offer real protection. Edward Snowden used it to encrypt his
    communications with journalists. All companies and individuals
    running Free Software systems use it to protect their software
    against manipulation - sometimes without even knowing about it.
    Credit card data and backups are routinely encrypted through
    GnuPG, and the program will be needed for many years in the future
    to restore that data.
  </p>
  <p>
    GnuPG this is free of charge for all those people around the
    world, but it costs money to develop and maintain.  For more than
    a decade, g10<sup>code</sup> GmbH, the company owned and
    headed by GnuPG's principal author Werner Koch, has been bearing
    the majority of these costs. The company is seeking EUR 120,000 to
    carry on its work on GnuPG in 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
    With this money, the company will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>hire a second developer to work on GnuPG</li>
    <li>maintain the GnuPG software and documentation</li>
    <li>put this vital bit of our privacy infrastructure on a more
        solid organisational footing, so that it will remain viable in
        the long term.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There are no fancy fundraising videos or goodies. Every cent of
    your donation will directly support the future development of
    GnuPG.  Donors will be listed on the GnuPG website and in the next
    GnuPG release, unless they choose to remain anonymous.
