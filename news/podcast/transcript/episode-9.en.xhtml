00:00.000 --> 00:18.480
Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:18.480 --> 00:21.880
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.240
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:25.240 --> 00:28.920
I'm Matthias Kushner, the President of the Free Software Foundation Europe, and I'm doing

00:28.920 --> 00:32.000
this podcast together with my colleague, Bonnie Merring.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.320
In this podcast episode, we will talk about the I Love Free Software Day, and we will

00:38.320 --> 00:41.280
discover how it came into existence.

00:41.280 --> 00:46.600
And I also talked with several people from our community and asked them why they think

00:46.600 --> 00:50.920
it's important to say thank you and celebrate the I Love Free Software Day and share our

00:50.920 --> 00:53.160
love for free software together.

00:53.160 --> 01:00.240
So Matthias, how did the I Love Free Software Day came into existence nearly 11 years ago?

01:00.240 --> 01:11.160
So yeah, that was in the end of 2009, beginning of 2010, where I was not a big fan of the

01:11.160 --> 01:17.960
Valentine's Day and I didn't like this commercial aspects of it, connecting this with saying

01:17.960 --> 01:22.800
others that you like them or love them.

01:22.800 --> 01:31.600
And so I just had this idea that when now on the Valentine's Day on 14th of February,

01:31.600 --> 01:33.960
the flower industry is always benefiting.

01:33.960 --> 01:40.280
Can't we use this day to benefit some of the groups?

01:40.280 --> 01:41.680
I appreciate a lot.

01:41.680 --> 01:47.760
So I thought it might be nice to use this day as a day to encourage people to say thank

01:47.760 --> 01:51.520
you in the free software community.

01:51.520 --> 01:56.400
And yeah, from this idea, it then started that we thought, okay, others agreed, let's

01:56.400 --> 02:03.480
use this day to encourage people to say thank you to other free software contributors.

02:03.480 --> 02:08.760
And we started to announce this day then and encourage people to do this.

02:08.760 --> 02:11.000
And from there on, then it started.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.040
So it was mainly a bit annoyance on the day as it is in several countries with a lot

02:19.040 --> 02:21.600
of commercial part of it.

02:21.600 --> 02:26.480
And then how can we translate that to our free software community and not just the

02:26.480 --> 02:29.200
romantic part of it?

02:29.200 --> 02:35.360
Okay, so you decided to share some love for free software.

02:35.360 --> 02:45.400
And what would you say was the most memorable activity or, yeah, let's say activity that

02:45.400 --> 02:50.200
happened during the last 11 years for the I love free software day?

02:50.200 --> 02:57.840
I think it's really difficult to point that to nail it down on one or a few activities.

02:57.840 --> 03:06.840
So for me, there are a few things, of course, which I remember, I directly remember, like

03:06.840 --> 03:13.960
as someone who loves comics myself, there are some really nice comics there, which people

03:13.960 --> 03:20.320
created for the I love free software day, there was also a very nice activity by some

03:20.320 --> 03:27.160
FSFE volunteers in Berlin and Frankfurt, where they use so-called gobo-pro-checktours.

03:27.160 --> 03:33.160
So light pro-checktours and during the night, pro-checkt it free software messages on

03:33.160 --> 03:35.600
public buildings.

03:35.600 --> 03:44.400
And one other part was also very, very nice to see that after a few years, there were other

03:44.400 --> 03:51.240
people joining, more people joining, then also some political parties or politicians joining

03:51.240 --> 03:58.360
like in one year, there was the whole parliamentary group of the Green Party in Germany, which

03:58.360 --> 04:02.720
shared an article by the I love free software with a picture of themselves.

04:02.720 --> 04:12.960
Or I remember a short video by Julia Reda throwing down some balloons with VLC colors.

04:12.960 --> 04:20.800
It was a video online color there and I think she was wearing a hat of VLC there.

04:20.800 --> 04:29.440
And we also, I remember that we were sitting in the FSFE office folding letters and adding

04:29.440 --> 04:35.240
roses to them, sending it to all members in the German parliament.

04:35.240 --> 04:39.840
And yeah, there were some other highlights, like at the first year or the second year,

04:39.840 --> 04:46.680
I was preparing some chocolate hearts with the message I love free software, but I love

04:46.680 --> 04:47.680
you more.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.400
And I was selling them at Fostem at the booth.

04:51.400 --> 05:01.680
Yeah, that was also nice or also other smaller things like decorating the office with balloons

05:01.680 --> 05:05.080
and baking muffins for my colleagues.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.840
That's something which I remember of course.

05:07.840 --> 05:14.920
And yeah, then also some, I think in general, it's really, it's a sum of all those small

05:14.920 --> 05:15.920
activities.

05:15.920 --> 05:21.560
It's it's some people or organizations who participated every year, like, I mean, definitely

05:21.560 --> 05:28.400
like wiki data or the document foundation day every year from what I remember they participated

05:28.400 --> 05:29.400
there.

05:29.400 --> 05:35.840
And people were sending messages every year, some had some really good ideas in one year.

05:35.840 --> 05:42.920
And so there were so many cool pictures and things I heard from others that they received

05:42.920 --> 05:45.760
the thank you by someone else and we're very happy about that.

05:45.760 --> 05:50.040
And so it's, it's really the sum of all those small things, not so much that the big ones

05:50.040 --> 05:51.040
I just mentioned.

05:51.040 --> 05:55.920
Yeah, I also remember them, but it's more this general feeling about all those small messages

05:55.920 --> 05:57.400
which I heard about.

05:57.400 --> 06:07.000
Okay, so it's more the coming together and sharing our love and our support for free software.

06:07.000 --> 06:16.560
Now, I mean, for me, the main aspect is still that people say thank you to someone else.

06:16.560 --> 06:22.920
And I mean, the activities there, they, a few of them, which I mentioned, they were there

06:22.920 --> 06:26.400
so that we can remind people to say thank you.

06:26.400 --> 06:30.480
But it's not so much about those activities or this part of it.

06:30.480 --> 06:35.200
The most important thing for me is the, the part that people actually do this.

06:35.200 --> 06:40.560
And they, they lead by, they don't so much talk about saying thank you, but they actually

06:40.560 --> 06:41.560
say thank you.

06:41.560 --> 06:47.520
Okay, this is a really good answer.

06:47.520 --> 06:51.640
What would you say, how did the I love free software they change over the years?

06:51.640 --> 06:55.320
Was there a difference in celebrating the I love free software, the early stages of

06:55.320 --> 07:01.000
the campaign to compare, for example, this year or the last year?

07:02.000 --> 07:08.760
I mean, I think in general, you, you see a little bit how, how it became a bit more professional.

07:08.760 --> 07:15.560
How we do it as a beginning when I, when I read the, the all the announcements, I think

07:15.560 --> 07:20.840
you can explain it well better nowadays with some more experience.

07:20.840 --> 07:27.160
Then we also, of course, over the time we had some, some more graphics.

07:27.160 --> 07:32.720
We had some t-shirts you can wear to promote it or to show your, your love for the work

07:32.720 --> 07:33.720
of others.

07:33.720 --> 07:38.720
There are some balloons, leaflets, or in one year we had some stress balls.

07:38.720 --> 07:44.560
So in case when, when you, when you want to write an angry buck report during the year or

07:44.560 --> 07:49.080
so you remember, oh, yeah, I should be thankful to others.

07:49.080 --> 07:54.720
Let's press this a hundred times and then write this, this email again.

07:54.720 --> 08:00.520
And any general, I mean, one of the things that, that you see is that more and more people

08:00.520 --> 08:07.000
participated and, and that it became and quite established tradition meanwhile that you

08:07.000 --> 08:12.560
don't have to remind people about it again, but they already have it in their calendars.

08:12.560 --> 08:17.160
There are even some, some programs where there are pop-up notices about the I love free software.

08:17.160 --> 08:23.240
They, so, yeah, it's from, from the message itself, it didn't change much.

08:23.240 --> 08:28.280
People had a lot of great ideas, what, what you can do there and that's inspiring others

08:28.280 --> 08:29.680
again then.

08:29.680 --> 08:36.720
But in general, it, it stayed the same over all those years that it's a day to thank

08:36.720 --> 08:42.560
other free software contributors about their, for their work and encourage others to do

08:42.560 --> 08:44.520
the same by doing this.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.520
So.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.000
Okay.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.040
And why do you think it is important to say thank you?

08:52.040 --> 09:00.000
Well, I think for, if you appreciate something others do, then why not say it to them?

09:00.000 --> 09:07.120
So I think it's motivating to receive feedback from others that you are doing something important.

09:07.120 --> 09:13.200
It's, it's something that, yeah, don't, don't just think about someone else is doing

09:13.200 --> 09:14.200
something great.

09:14.200 --> 09:21.520
Oh, I like their work, but actually say it, say it out loud, tell them either, I mean,

09:21.520 --> 09:26.080
say it to them in an email where you write in there in your own name, if you feel the

09:26.080 --> 09:31.920
child whatsoever, then you can also like with Valentine's Day, original day, also send

09:31.920 --> 09:35.480
an anonymous message thanking them for their work.

09:35.480 --> 09:41.640
And I think if you, if there's one day where you remember to say thank you, it's then

09:41.640 --> 09:45.240
also way easier to remember saying thank you over the rest of the year.

09:45.240 --> 09:50.920
So I mean, that's, that's one of the things that the goal when we started that was not

09:50.920 --> 09:57.080
so much that just say thank you on this one day and the rest of the year, you can be,

09:57.080 --> 10:03.600
you can say bad things to others and behave inappropriate and so on, that's not the idea.

10:03.600 --> 10:10.240
The idea is remember to be thankful to others, thank them for their work, either if they

10:10.240 --> 10:16.200
do their work in their volunteer time or if they even also do their free software work

10:16.200 --> 10:17.960
being paid for it.

10:17.960 --> 10:22.680
If you benefit from that and you appreciate other people's work there, use this day

10:22.680 --> 10:24.920
to say thank you.

10:24.920 --> 10:29.280
And while doing that, then afterwards remember to also do that over the rest of the year

10:29.280 --> 10:33.080
because you don't have to wait for the 14th of February.

10:33.080 --> 10:38.520
You can tell them also during summer or in the end of the year that you, you like what

10:38.520 --> 10:39.520
they are doing.

10:39.520 --> 10:45.120
And I mean, I'm, I'm just convinced that when you did it once, it's easier to do it the

10:45.120 --> 10:50.120
next time and when you did it twice, it's easier to do it the third time.

10:50.120 --> 10:57.760
So I hope that it helps people to say thank you several times during the year and say thank

10:57.760 --> 11:05.880
you to other people there who are also working for software freedom.

11:05.880 --> 11:10.520
So I was also wondering what others from the free software community think about the

11:10.520 --> 11:16.680
free software day and why they think it's important to share our love for free software.

11:16.680 --> 11:22.000
I talked to several people from the free software community and asked them why they think

11:22.000 --> 11:24.520
it's important to say thank you.

11:24.520 --> 11:29.880
I would like to start with Greg Farrow from the free software foundation with Greg Crower

11:29.880 --> 11:36.400
Hartman, who's one of the Linux kernel developers with Lydia Pincher, who's the vice president

11:36.400 --> 11:44.760
from KDE and the Florian Femberga, who is the executive director of that document foundation.

11:44.760 --> 11:48.400
So Greg, why do you think it's important to say thank you.

11:48.400 --> 11:53.440
Hey, this is Greg Farrow, the campaigns manager at the free software foundation.

11:53.440 --> 11:56.800
You know, all of us in the community depend on free software, but we don't always take

11:56.800 --> 12:01.200
the time to let its developers and development community know how much we appreciate them.

12:01.200 --> 12:06.000
So I'm glad we have something like I love free software day to remind us to do that.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.080
Hey, Greg.

12:09.080 --> 12:12.000
So why do you think it's important to say thank you?

12:12.000 --> 12:18.960
It's important to thank anybody who does something that they don't have to do for your use,

12:18.960 --> 12:19.960
right?

12:19.960 --> 12:20.960
I mean, that's just nice.

12:20.960 --> 12:21.960
That's good manners.

12:21.960 --> 12:26.720
They're giving you something that they don't have to give you, but they are and you can

12:26.720 --> 12:28.240
take advantage of that.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.520
You can use that, not take advantage.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.520
You can use that.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.440
So of course they should be thanked.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.000
Do you think it keeps projects alive?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.440
It's just basic human manners.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.760
So yes, it's always nice to feel appreciated, right?

12:41.760 --> 12:46.560
So if somebody sends me something or if I send a patch out to somebody, I want to at least

12:46.560 --> 12:50.040
have it acknowledged that they received it, whether it's good, whether it's bad or

12:50.040 --> 12:54.640
what not, because if not, then why would you want to continue to contribute?

12:54.640 --> 12:59.920
So yes, I think it's very important for projects to do that.

13:00.920 --> 13:04.880
Why do you think it's important to say thank you?

13:04.880 --> 13:10.440
I think it's really important to say thank you to each other in free software, because

13:10.440 --> 13:18.880
so many people pour in endless hours of work and it can be rare, rare, endless job at

13:18.880 --> 13:19.880
times.

13:19.880 --> 13:28.840
And a simple thank you here and there can really help show some appreciation and show

13:28.840 --> 13:34.280
that the work that people are doing is really valuable and appreciated.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.160
Do you think it keeps people motivated?

13:37.160 --> 13:48.880
Yes, seeing the positive impact that your work has on other people is really motivating

13:48.880 --> 13:54.840
and one way to know that your work is actually having an impact and that your program, for

13:54.840 --> 14:01.200
example, is being used by someone is if someone sent you an email saying thank you for what

14:01.200 --> 14:09.400
you've done and showing some appreciation for that.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.680
Hello, nice to meet you.

14:11.680 --> 14:17.520
So I'm Florian from the Document Foundation, I'm the Executive Director and I've been

14:17.520 --> 14:23.440
involved in the Libre Office project for many, many years since the beginning and in

14:23.440 --> 14:30.800
the area of free software, I think since 2004, so for quite a while.

14:30.800 --> 14:36.800
So I think it's important to remember that free software basically drives our lives every

14:36.800 --> 14:37.800
day.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.520
So when you wake up in the morning, you might have one of those fancy coffee machines

14:40.520 --> 14:46.080
at home that help you start into the day on the road when we're working, we have mobiles

14:46.080 --> 14:52.280
and tablets that help us to be productive, then we use the internet for research, also

14:52.280 --> 14:57.320
streaming music and movies and of course these days staying in touch with our loved ones

14:57.320 --> 15:02.400
while we're conferencing and all of that even if we might not know that is often powered

15:02.400 --> 15:04.480
by free software.

15:04.480 --> 15:10.080
Looking at the future, cars driving, autonomous and whatnot, also that can literally be driven

15:10.080 --> 15:16.040
by free software and free software traditionally is created in communities.

15:16.040 --> 15:22.200
But communities are in the end always made up of human beings, of individuals contributing

15:22.200 --> 15:23.200
for whatever reason.

15:23.200 --> 15:29.960
It wasn't here, it paid, they worked together on the same goal and I think it's important

15:29.960 --> 15:37.080
to thank everyone involved because it helps you to stay motivated, that is an appreciation,

15:37.080 --> 15:41.680
that means we don't take things for granted but we appreciate what you're doing and it

15:41.680 --> 15:47.640
goes from developers to localizers to testers, people marketing, design, infrastructure

15:47.640 --> 15:52.880
and all the dozens of areas that we have in free software that help to make these ideas

15:52.880 --> 15:54.720
come to life.

15:54.720 --> 16:00.000
So it's important to thank everyone who contributes their time, their passion and their skills

16:00.000 --> 16:01.920
into that area.

16:01.920 --> 16:08.160
I also talk with two people from the FSF Eastlinger Network, Miriam Bauhausen who is also part

16:08.160 --> 16:14.000
of the program committee of the legal licensing workshop and Pamela Chastak, who is also part

16:14.000 --> 16:19.560
of the legal network and is also on the board of the open sites initiative.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.480
So let's see what they have to say.

16:21.480 --> 16:29.200
Hi, I'm Miriam Bauhausen and I'm here to say thank you to free software developers because

16:29.200 --> 16:35.800
they have been really involved in a really good idea and really good approach and software

16:35.800 --> 16:43.920
is just everywhere and they have been supporting development of software for such a long time

16:43.920 --> 16:48.600
and engaging in the community and making things better for everyone.

16:48.600 --> 16:53.880
Hi, I'm Pamela.

16:53.880 --> 17:01.160
The free software movement sort of restores my faith in humanity and I know that that's

17:01.160 --> 17:08.760
kind of a big statement to make, but we have this, so I'm a copyright lawyer.

17:08.760 --> 17:14.720
So the things that I say tend to focus on the law and sort of the legal aspects, but I

17:14.720 --> 17:18.240
do know that I have kind of blinders on.

17:18.240 --> 17:26.480
But the reason I say that is that there's this sort of belief that people only create

17:26.480 --> 17:31.000
works if they're compensated for it.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.320
That's actually built into the US Constitution that says, well, we'll protect copyright because

17:35.320 --> 17:42.360
it encourages people to create works in order to financially exploit them.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.720
And I've kind of never believed that.

17:45.720 --> 17:53.280
And so the entire free software world creates these works because they love what they do,

17:53.280 --> 17:55.080
they love to create them.

17:55.080 --> 18:00.920
And they're not, yes, getting paid to do it is a lovely thing, but there's so much more

18:00.920 --> 18:02.160
motive behind that.

18:02.160 --> 18:07.800
And it's a motive of sharing and a motive of caring about other people and about collaboration.

18:07.800 --> 18:14.920
And so it's just a very inspiring environment and movement for me to be involved with because

18:14.920 --> 18:20.080
people are so giving of themselves and I just really am very touched by that.

18:25.760 --> 18:32.800
And last but not least, I talked with Paulina Malaya, who is a volunteer 30 FSF East care

18:32.800 --> 18:35.600
team, for example.

18:35.600 --> 18:42.080
And she also works for a center who is the council of European national top level domain

18:42.080 --> 18:43.800
registry.

18:43.800 --> 18:49.200
And her answer let me reflect on the way I think about free software in a more philosophical

18:49.200 --> 18:50.200
way.

18:50.200 --> 18:56.200
I'm really happy to share her answer with you.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.440
Free software powers our world.

18:58.440 --> 19:03.360
Our phones, the internet of things and pieces of critical digital infrastructure run on

19:03.360 --> 19:04.520
free software.

19:04.520 --> 19:09.920
However, behind these devices and applications are people who build, maintain and improve

19:09.920 --> 19:12.120
this for the benefit of all.

19:12.120 --> 19:17.440
As free software allows everybody to use, study, share and improve it, the individual effort

19:17.440 --> 19:22.800
behind can sometimes be a bit more hidden because it may seem that in a way it belongs

19:22.800 --> 19:25.800
to everybody and nobody at the same time.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.680
But this is misleading.

19:27.680 --> 19:31.680
And I think that it is important to thank free software developers for their continuous

19:31.680 --> 19:37.760
contributions and all the great software out there that helps out communities, researchers,

19:37.760 --> 19:42.160
tinkerers and everyone else to be empowered by technology.

19:42.160 --> 19:47.360
Their continuous efforts are needed to ensure that free software remains the cornerstone

19:47.360 --> 19:53.120
of open culture and free society.

19:53.120 --> 19:58.200
I also ask those people who they would like to say thank you to and I'm grateful that

19:58.200 --> 20:03.320
I now have the opportunity to share their love and their thanks for free software with

20:03.320 --> 20:08.160
you and with the whole free software community and the different projects they say thank

20:08.160 --> 20:10.560
you to.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.080
Just listen to their answers.

20:12.080 --> 20:17.040
For my part, I'd like to thank all the developers and hackers on GNU EMAX and GNU Screen.

20:17.040 --> 20:21.160
Two tools I've been using just about as long as I can remember and thanks to you to all

20:21.160 --> 20:25.320
the free software supporters out there who keep on advocating for freedom in their communities

20:25.320 --> 20:28.800
whether that's the workplace school, wherever they happen to be.

20:28.800 --> 20:35.000
Thanks a lot, see you next year.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.720
I thank everybody who contributes to Linux when they send me a patch.

20:38.720 --> 20:44.480
So I thank them by acknowledging their change and either giving them feedback or saying

20:44.480 --> 20:46.600
that I accept their patch and thanks for that.

20:46.600 --> 20:52.200
So I do that today for Linux, but there's loads of other projects out there that I rely

20:52.200 --> 20:53.200
on every day.

20:53.200 --> 21:00.760
So the tools that I rely on, like the compilers, GCC, Coreytales from GNU Project, MUT,

21:00.760 --> 21:07.240
my email client, browsers, Chrome or Firefox.

21:07.240 --> 21:13.320
I rely on these every day, X windows, the wayland, the basic low-level plumbing of Linux

21:13.320 --> 21:15.840
is what I rely on every day.

21:15.840 --> 21:20.160
So I think I would love to thank those authors and thank them for doing that work because

21:20.160 --> 21:24.440
it enables me to make a kernel that everybody else can build those things on top of.

21:24.440 --> 21:32.840
So thank you.

21:32.840 --> 21:44.280
There are a lot of people I would think starting with every single contributor that puts time

21:44.280 --> 21:55.680
into making KDE software amazing, of course, since that is my home community, so to say.

21:55.680 --> 22:03.360
But there's a ton of other people who make the software that I use every day.

22:03.360 --> 22:09.760
You can go on with the Linux distribution that I use or the video land people who make

22:09.760 --> 22:18.680
an amazing video player just to name a few.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.880
So I feel there's probably too many to remember.

22:20.880 --> 22:25.880
Of course, with my LibreOffice head on, I'd like to thank all the contributors to LibreOffice

22:25.880 --> 22:31.000
and to the documentation project, whether they're in the videos, companies, the end users,

22:31.000 --> 22:37.080
the donors, all of them they make the project fly without them, the project wouldn't be possible.

22:37.080 --> 22:42.480
And then thinking of my use of free software, there are so many projects worldwide, some

22:42.480 --> 22:43.480
of them really visible.

22:43.480 --> 22:49.440
You have a browser, you have a mail client, but then there are many projects that we might

22:49.440 --> 22:54.960
not immediately recognize to provide the infrastructure that we use, that runs somehow

22:54.960 --> 22:59.640
magically in the background or they provide libraries for the tools that we build.

22:59.640 --> 23:05.920
So there are so many projects that I really don't want to just focus on one specific name.

23:05.920 --> 23:11.800
I use a lot of free software each day, I'm productive with that, I get entertainment

23:11.800 --> 23:17.160
with that, I can grow my skills with free software, I can hack around a bit.

23:17.160 --> 23:22.760
So I'd just like to thank everyone who's involved in that, as a coder, being working on open

23:22.760 --> 23:28.320
standards, spreading the word, documenting, localizing, I think each and every contribution

23:28.320 --> 23:33.160
is really important, each and every contribution makes a difference.

23:33.160 --> 23:39.800
And we all need one another, so it's really great to be part of a community, be it as a consumer

23:39.800 --> 23:45.840
or as a creator, so just like to thank everyone dedicating their energy and passion into that.

23:45.840 --> 23:53.800
It really improves our daily lives and for me personally is a big part of what my personal

23:53.800 --> 23:58.240
and professional life is about.

23:58.240 --> 24:05.960
I would thank the fantastic people on the legal network who continuously raised such great

24:05.960 --> 24:12.240
questions and provide input, provide their thoughts on whatever questions they come up with,

24:12.240 --> 24:17.600
whatever questions they have, and interesting material they run across, and it's just great

24:17.600 --> 24:26.280
to be a part of that and great to connect with them, discuss with them, and it's just always

24:26.280 --> 24:33.120
a good time to hear from them.

24:33.120 --> 24:39.200
I certainly would love to thank all of the open source lawyers who have helped me learn

24:39.200 --> 24:41.880
and continue to help me learn.

24:41.880 --> 24:50.640
They are universally generous with their time and knowledge and allow me to get the knowledge

24:50.640 --> 24:55.360
that I have, so certainly I thank them so much.

24:55.360 --> 25:02.480
And I thank those, one person who particularly comes to mind is Karen Sandler, who has, if

25:02.480 --> 25:06.720
you've heard her story, she's a very personal story about why she's involved in open source

25:06.720 --> 25:11.920
software and free software, which is, you know, it sort of exemplifies to me what the

25:11.920 --> 25:17.960
value is of free software and why we need to have it and why it's important.

25:17.960 --> 25:24.560
Just, you know, so many, just so many, everybody that I meet at the conferences when I go to

25:24.560 --> 25:30.360
FASDEM and, you know, have the opportunity to see all the developers and all the energy.

25:30.360 --> 25:33.320
It's just a wonderful, wonderful experience.

25:33.320 --> 25:43.080
So I just so many people, just incredibly grateful to know such wonderful people.

25:43.080 --> 25:49.920
I would like to thank everybody who is behind such great projects and communities like,

25:49.920 --> 25:59.120
first of all, Nupi G, then from a soft, of course, signal and my two favorite Linux distributions

25:59.120 --> 26:01.640
Ubuntu and elementary.

26:01.640 --> 26:09.120
And finally, I just want to say thanks to all other countless, wonderful free software

26:09.120 --> 26:14.600
projects out there as well, that I forgot to mention, but that continue improving my everyday

26:14.600 --> 26:16.800
life.

26:16.800 --> 26:23.200
I would like to say thank you to Greg Farrell, to Greg Karohatman, to Lydia, Florian,

26:23.200 --> 26:27.440
Pavela, Palina and Miriam for their contribution to this podcast.

26:27.440 --> 26:28.440
Thank you, Roomba.

26:28.440 --> 26:32.080
Thanks to you, Bonnie, for making sure that more people know about the other free software

26:32.080 --> 26:34.480
day and hopefully say thank you.

26:34.480 --> 26:40.120
So especially in the times of little direct feedback at events like when you usually meet

26:40.120 --> 26:46.720
people at a conference and send them, give them a short sign of the abbreviation, short

26:46.720 --> 26:47.720
thank you.

26:47.720 --> 26:54.240
It's, it's especially important now to, to thank people who are working towards more software

26:54.240 --> 26:55.480
freedom there.

26:55.480 --> 27:02.400
So my request to you is use this 14th of February, make sure that you say at least one other

27:02.400 --> 27:06.800
person in our movement, thank you about it, about their work.

27:06.800 --> 27:11.800
And yeah, then hopefully we can all soon do that again in person.

27:11.800 --> 27:15.880
But for this year, please remember to do this in a virtual way.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.680
Thank you very much.

27:17.680 --> 27:21.840
Bye.
