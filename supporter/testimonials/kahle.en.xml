	  Free software is about empowerment. When I was a student with little
	  money, Linux enabled me to do interesting things with my cheap and old
	  computer where the pre-installed software failed. Since then, my whole
	  education and many achievements would have been impossible had I not
	  been able to experiment, learn, disassemble, reassemble, modify, tweak,
	  and use software the way I wanted. This kind of empowerment needs a
	  strong lobby - the FSFE.
