    <description>
The June 29th 2007 release of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License (GPL) marked the end of an eighteen month public
consultation process.  During this time, FSFE worked to raise
awareness of the changes proposed for the licence, to help the
community to participate in the public consultation, and to document
the ongoing discussion to make this topic as accessible as possible.
