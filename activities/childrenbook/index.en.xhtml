  <p><strong>This is work in progress.</strong> Here you find additional
  information and resources about the book "Ada and Zangemann" by <a

  <h2>About the book</h2>

  <blockquote><p>The famous inventor Zangemann lives in a huge villa high above
  the city. Adults and children alike love his inventions and are desperate to
  have them. But then something happens: when Zangemann wants to take another
  close-up look at his inventions during a walk through the city, a child hits
  him in the shin with the skateboard. That hurts! Enraged, the inventor makes
  a momentous decision... The clever girl Ada sees through what is going on.
  Together with her friends, she forges a plan.</p>

  <p>This illustrated children's book tells the story of the famous inventor
  Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment with
  hardware and software and in the process realises how crucial it is for her
  and others to control technology.</p>

  <p>A book that arouses children's interest in tinkering and encourages to
  shape technology.</p></blockquote>

  <p>The book is currently available in German and can be <a href="">ordered
  directly from the publisher O'reilly Germany</a> or with your preferred book
  store with the ISBN XXXX.</p>

  <p>We are working on a English version. As soon as the English version is
  done we would be interested in <strong>more translations</strong>. If you
  want to help us with enabling professional published translations, <a
  href="mailto:contact@fsfe.org?subject=Ada and Zangemann">reach out to
  us</a>.</p>

  <h2>How to learn coding?</h2>

  <p>There are many resources out which help young people to learn programming.
  Our community is gathering more information about that topic on our <a
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/action/edit/Activities/ProgrammingForChildren">wiki
  page</a> and we invite you to help us with amending and keeping this
  up-to-date.</p>

  <!-- <h2>Download paint templates</h2> 

  Insert PDF templates to print and children can paint them out.  

  One with skateboard, one with the demonstration so that they can put in own words and sent it in. -->

  <p>We would love to publish pictures of paintings or other things that
  children created about the book. In case your child painted an own version of
  Ada or Zangemann, a modified skateboard, how they imagine software, or how
  computer who print ice cream could look like in future. Please <a
  href="mailto:contact@fsfe.org?subject=Ada and Zangemann">e-mail them to us
  </a> including the permission for us to publish them under either CC-0 or
