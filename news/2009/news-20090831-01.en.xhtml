<h1>Thomas Jensch takes on coordination for FSFE's edu-team</h1>

<p>Thomas Jensch, FSFE's current intern in the Zurich office, took on the
role of coordinator for FSFE's edu-team. During his internship, one of Thomas' tasks is to
reorganise and revive FSFE's activities related to Free Software in education. He already agreed to continue 
coordinating the team after the conclusion of his internship in November.</p>

<p>One of the first objectives of the team will be the update and restyling
of the <a href="/freesoftware/education/education.html">Education project pages</a> and
the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Education">collection of useful information
and links</a> about Free Software in education.</p>

<p>To receive information about the progresses and news of the edu-team, it
is possible to register to the <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/edu-eu/">edu-eu@gnu.org mailing list</a>, to get 
in contact with the core team you can send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:edu-team@lists.fsfe.org">edu-team@lists.fsfe.org</a></p>
