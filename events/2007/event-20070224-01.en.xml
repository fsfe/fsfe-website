      FSFE will attend FOSDEM 2007 which takes place from 24th - 25th
      of February in Brussels, Belgium. FOSDEM is a European Free
	  Software developer conference organized by volunteers.
	  <br />

      The FSFE will be present with a booth where visitors will be
      informed about recent activities, Free Software itself and the
      Fellowship of the FSFE.
      Georg Greve, president of FSFE, will do this year's Closing Keynote, 
      on the topic of "Beyond GPLv3: Free Software today and tomorrow".
      Shane  M. Coughlan will be giving a Lightning talk at FOSDEM about the Free Software
      licensing and the Freedom Task Force.
      As usual, T-Shirts will be sold as well.
	  <br />

      The event promotes the widespread use of Free Software, to
      provide Free Software developers and communities a place to
      meet, to get in touch with other projects, and to promote the
	  development and the benefits of Free Software solutions.
