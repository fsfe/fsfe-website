      Free Software Foundation Europe is ten years old this March. FSFE was
      founded <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20010331035357/http://fsfeurope.org/">in 2001</a>
      as "an organization dedicated to Free Software activities in Europe" and
      "the <a href="http://fsfe.org/about/fsfnetwork.html">official sister
      organization</a> of the Free Software Foundation in the United States"
      in Europe.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Today, FSFE <a href="http://fsfe.org/work.html">works</a>
      across Europe and around the world. The organisation has grown into
      a focal point for the European Free Software community and an
      important voice for Free Software in politics.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      "As we look back on a decade of hard work, we would like to thank
      everyone who has helped to make FSFE what it is today. We have come
      a long way, and we're immensely proud of what we have achieved
      together," says FSFE's president Karsten Gerloff.
    </p>
