<li>Making the rules</li>
<li>Supporting developers with legal expertise</li>
</ul>

<h2>The new frontline: General purpose computing</h2>
<p>The Internet and computers in all their forms have become an essential
part of modern civilisation. They have deeply changed the way we live,
work, create, and dream. The technological progress we have seen over
the past couple of decades was only possible because of general
purpose computers -computers that will perform any task we give them-,
and networks that don't care what kind of data we transmit through
them, as Karsten Gerloff explained in a talk entitled <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/523537/">All watched over by machines
of loving grace?"</a>.</p>

<p>But this freedom to make our computers do anything we can imagine is
under threat. Locked-down devices are everywhere, from the iPhone to
"smart" TVs and game consoles. If we let this trend continue, the only
freedom we will enjoy in a few years will be the freedom to choose our
masters.</p>

<p>So we have made general purpose computing a focus topic for our
work. We want you to be in full control of the technology you use. The
limit for your ideas should be the boundaries of your imagination, not
some marketing department's plan to take more money from of you.</p>

<h3>Take charge of your phone</h3>

<p>We decided to start as close to the people as possible: in their
pockets. Your mobile phone is the most personal of your devices. It
knows who you talk to, where you are, and what your plans are. So it's
important that you have full control over what it does.</p>
<p>That is where our <a href="http://fsfe.org/campaigns/android/android.en.html">Free Your Android</a> campaign comes in. We organise
workshops to help people install operating systems on their phones
that don't tie them to a particular company or service provider, and
respect their privacy. At the end of the day participants don't just
have a better phone, but something even more important: The knowledge
that they can truly control the technology they use.</p>
<p>Torsten Grote, a former Fellowship representative, and new staffer
Erik Albers have run or supported nine workshops since August,
from Spain and Sweden through Germany and Italy to Slovenia and
Kosovo, with over 100 participants. <a href="mailto:android@lists.fsfe.org">Get in touch</a> if you would like to
become a trainer and/or organise a workshop near you.</p>



<h3>Your freedom to install Free Software</h3>
<p>If you can't install whatever software you choose on a computer, you
don't really own it. Many PCs and mobile devices that went on sale
from late 2012 come with a mechanism called "SecureBoot" ("Restricted
Boot" would be a more appropriate name) that would prevent you from
doing exactly that. We <a href="http://fsfe.org/campaigns/generalpurposecomputing/secure-boot-analysis.en.html">accompanied this process,</a> and have made our
demands clear: Device owners must have complete and sole control of
their devices. This and other demands were echoed in a <a href="http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Themen/OED_Verwaltung/Informationsgesellschaft/trusted_computing_eng.html">white paper</a> by Germany's
federal government. We will continue to raise this issue with
politicians, consumer protection groups and anyone else who can help
us defend your freedom.</p>
<p>We also overhauled our <a href="http://drm.info">drm.info</a> website with fresh information about
digital restrictions management (DRM).  [[blogs.fsfe.org/samtuke/%3Fp%3D255][talked to the BBC]] about
teaching kids how to program. Fellow Anna Morris and our campaign
manager Sam Tuke both spoke to the BBC -- [[http://download.fsfe.org/audio/20120320-bbc5-interview-anna-morris.ogg][Anna]] about a conference for
women in Free Software that she organised, and [[blogs.fsfe.org/samtuke/%3Fp%3D255][Sam]] about teaching
kids how to program.</p>

<h3>Get rid of digital handcuffs - use Open Standards</h3>
<p>This year's <a href="http://www.documentfreedom.org/">Document Freedom Day</a> was the most successful yet of our
annual campaigns for <a href="http://fsfe.org/projects/os/os.en.html">Open Standards</a>. Volunteers organised 54 events in
23 countries. Proprietary file formats are like digital handcuffs --
so we sent out 100 info packages to politicians and public figures,
each containing a letter and a set of handcuffs. Among the recipients
were Pope Benedict XVI. and EU Commissioner Neelie Kroes, who liked
the idea so much that she demonstrated the handcuffs in one of her speeches.</p>

<h2>Making the rules</h2>
<p>We give the Free Software movement a voice in politics. We push for
rules that are good for software freedom, and work to get rid of those
that are bad for Free Software.</p>

<p>In May, the <a href="http://fsfe.org/news/2012/news-20120627-01.en.html">European Court of Justice ordered Microsoft</a> to finally pay
a record fine of 860 million euros for using its near-monopoly on the
desktop to keep rivals out of the workgroup server market.  Microsoft
had previously spent over three billion Euro to buy third parties out
of the case. We stayed on the case for almost a decade, and asserted
the rights of Free Software developers to access interoperability
information, especially for the Samba Team. Samba is a Free Software
system for sharing files and printers that is a competitor to Microsoft's
proprietary products. The court eventually agreed with us: Receiving
the interoperability information was a right of the Free Software
community, not a concession by Microsoft.</p>

<p>The European Parliament adopted <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2012/news-20121208-01.en.html">an ill-conceived compromise</a> for a
single European patent system, opening the door for even more patents on software to be granted and enforced. We will work hard to protect the Free
Software community from the negative consequences of this decision.</p> 

<p>After almost two years of wavering, the UK government in November
published a new policy on Open Standards, and introduced some
fundamental changes to the way the government buys software. The
country's government bodies are now required to prefer Open Standards,
and have to figure exit costs into the price of any new solution they
buy. <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2012/news-20120425-02.en.html">We rallied opposition</a> to former government plans for anti-Free 
Software legislation, and worked  with the UK government  for almost two years to help them build a strong Open Standards policy. </p>

<p>The German parliament asked Matthias Kirschner, our German Team
coordinator, to participate in its experts' commission on Free
Software. He did a great job of speaking up for the Free Software
movement. We're expecting the group's recommendations to be published
in early 2013.</p>

<p>Our Finland coordinator Otto Kekäläinen together with lawyer Martin
van Willebrandt <a href="http://fsfe.org/news/2012/news-20120619-01.en.html">monitored calls for tender in Finland</a> to see if they
mentioned brand names, and <a hfref="http://fsfe.org/news/2012/news-20120711-01.en.html">took Helsinki's city government to tas</a> for
a botched OpenOffice pilot project. In November, Otto received the <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2012/news-20121112-01.en.html">Nordic Free Software Award</a> in recognition of the great job he's been
doing. </p>

<p>In other countries, too, government procurement was a hot issue this
year. We helped the <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/gerloff/2012/06/04/common-sense-in-the-basque-country/">Basque Country in Spain to make a rule</a> that
programs developed with public funds should be published as Free
Software [FIXME: link]. The governments of Italy  and France [FIXME: link] told their public bodies
to prefer Free Software.</p>

<p>Our general counsel Carlo Piana and president Karsten Gerloff helped
the European Parliament to [[http://opensource.com/government/12/7/helping-european-parliament-release-its-own-free-software][release some Free Software of its own]], and
answered legal and practical questions from the Parliament's IT
team. The software should become available by mid-2013. At the same
time, we [[http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/it-business/3346719/free-software-foundation-urges-eu-parliament-staff-to-reject-microsoft-bribe/][warned the Parliament's administration]] that they were
compromising staff politically by offering them gratis licenses to
proprietary software.</p>

<h3>Supporting developers with legal expertise</h3>
<p>Our [[https://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/ftf.en.html][legal team]] helped more than 60 Free Software developers and
projects to resolve licensing questions and other legal problems. In
three "Hacking for Compliance" workshops, we trained volunteers to
analyse and report embedded devices for GPL violations, so that
the gpl-violations.org project could pursue them. Our General Counsel Carlo Piana and Legal Coordinator Matija Šuklje supported the Free Your Android campaign by making it clear that [[https://fsfe.org/news/2012/news-20121106-01.en.html][flashing your phone does not void your warranty]].</p>
<p>The international Legal Network which we facilitate continues to be
the premier place for Free Software legal experts to meet and exchange views. The annual Free Software Legal and Licensing workshop, organised
by FSFE's Legal Team, attracted more than 60 lawyers, developers and
engineers. In two days of discussing compliance, governance and
patents, they contributed to a better understanding of how companies
and community groups can use Free Software to their advantage.</p>
