    <h1>FSFE concerned about Novell patent sale</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">Free Software Foundation Europe has written to the
German competition authorities in order to share its concerns about
the sale of Novell's patents to a consortium called CPTN, made up of
Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and EMC.</p>

<p>"If the sale of Novell’s patents to CPTN is allowed to go ahead,
this will significantly increase the legal threat level for Free
Software", says FSFE's President Karsten Gerloff in an <a
href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/gerloff/2011/01/12/why-were-concerned-about-the-sale-of-novells-patents/">article</a>
on the issue.  </p>

<p>On December 22, 2010, FSFE wrote to the German competition
authorities with a <a
href="/campaigns/swpat/letter-20101222.html">detailed
explanation</a> of the negative effect that the acquisition of
Novell's patents by CPTN would have for competition in the software
market.</p>

<p>"This case is yet another demonstration of how software patents make
life difficult for everyone in the software market", Gerloff
says. "And it provides yet another reason to continue <a
href="/campaigns/swpat/">FSFE's long-standing work
against software patents</a>.</p>
