        <title>FSFE General Assembly in Arnhem, Netherlands</title>

    <body>
      <p>The members of the FSFE e.V. (see here for a full list) is the organisation's highest organ and take decisions about (primarily) budgets and the election of the President, Vice President and Financial Officer (see our constitution). Decisions of special importance to the organisation can sometimes be taken by the members as well. The group meets once a year in a different place in Europe where there are members for a strategic weekend in which the long term strategy for Free Software is discussed, and where the formal annual assembly is held. The minutes of the general assembly meetings are public. </p>
