<p>
  Librem 5 runs the fully convergent PureOS, which means you can take 
  your desktop with you within your phone. Its dedicated graphical 
  environment, Phosh, is becoming a popular option for Linux phones. 
  Guido Günther, one of Purism’s main developers, reveals details of 
  Librem’s software development in this interview.

<p>
  Having a Free Software phone gives you control over your device. You 
  can gain a higher level of privacy protection, and you can finally 
  avoid apps you were stuck with before. It also means you can often 
  keep your device for longer, and <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/index.html">protect the 
  environment</a> by reducing e-waste.
</p>

<p>
  When deciding on your switch to a Free Software operating system, your 
  options are installing a new system on your current phone or 
  acquiring a phone with a Free Software operating system 
  pre-installed.
</p>

<p>
  The latter is clearly the easier route, and Purism’s Librem 5 may be 
  the solution for you. By default, it runs PureOS, a Free Software 
  operating system that comes with Phosh, its polished graphical 
  environment. Projects like postmarketOS, Mobian, and Debian have 
  picked up Phosh too, putting it into use on other devices and 
  contributing patches.
</p>

<p>
  Guido Günther is one of the main developers of Phosh (and an <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">FSFE supporter</a>!) and he kindly 
  agreed to tell us about the software, how it fits within the Librem 5 
  ecosystem, and its advantages.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Fani Partsafyllidou</strong>: I would like to start with a basic question, 
  what do you do at Purism?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Guido Günther</strong>: That is not easy to answer, but here goes: I am mostly 
  working on the Librem 5 phone. I was involved with the initial board 
  bringup of making Linux work on the device by writing device drivers 
  and user space components. Since we needed a graphical shell and 
  compositor, I worked with others on the team on that too. That is how 
  Phosh was born.
</p>

<p>
  I also work on improving PureOS, the Debian based Linux distribution 
  that runs on the phones and on the laptops. Our aim is to improve the 
  Free Software ecosystems for mobile devices (like smartphones) in 
  general, and the Librem 5 in particular.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Fani</strong>: Librem 5 runs PureOS, right?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Guido</strong>: Yes. Like all of Purism&#39;s products, the Librem 5 runs 
  PureOS, which is a Debian-based operating system that is customized 
  to fit Purism&#39;s devices so it is convenient for end users. It 
  also has <a href="https://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-adds-pureos-to-list-of-endorsed-gnu-linux-distributions-1">FSF’s 
  endorsement</a>
</p>

<p><strong>Fani</strong>: And what does Phosh do?</p>

<p>
  <strong>Guido</strong>: Phosh is the graphical shell, the environment you interact 
  with on the phone. It is built up from multiple components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    the Wayland compositor, phoc, is responsible for drawing things on the screen, it leverages the wlroots library for that;
  </li>
  <li>
    then there is an on-screen keyboard called squeekboard; 
  </li>
  <li>
    finally there is the shell itself, which is responsible for things like the lock screen, notifications, the GUI elements on the top and bottom bar, quick settings, etc. It is based on the gimp toolkit and other components of the GNOME desktop. Here is an <a href="https://honk.sigxcpu.org/con/phosh_overview.html">overview</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Initially we were only going to call the graphical shell itself 
  “Phosh”, but the community latched on to the name and identified the 
  whole mobile experience that it is based on (phosh + phoc + 
  squeekboard + all the GNOME components) as “Phosh”, so the name 
  stuck.
</p>

<p><strong>Fani</strong>: Which phones run Phosh?</p>

<p>
  <strong>Guido</strong>: While Phosh was initially developed for the Librem 5, it is 
  also being used by all kinds of mobile devices that can run Linux, 
  like the original Pinephones and the Pinephone Pro. It&#39;s also 
  used on devices that formerly ran Android but can now also run Linux, 
  like the OnePlus devices. People are also using it on tablets and 
  laptops running Linux. The main use case is certainly smartphones 
  running Linux, though.
</p>

<p>
  It is worth noting that Phosh is not restricted to PureOS. 
  PostmarketOS, for example, ships it. It is in Debian, and, as far as 
  I know, also in Fedora, Manjaro, and many other Linux distributions.
</p>

<p>
  Very often when you see screenshots of phones running Linux, they will 
  be running Phosh. Here is someone running it on a <a href="https://twitter.com/xmlich02/status/1519966989116133376">cutiepie</a>, 
  and here&#39;s someone running Phosh (using postmarketOS) on a <a href="https://twitter.com/calebccff/status/1510930222757158917">Poco 
  F1</a>, which was an Android phone before.
</p>

<p>
  Phosh is very often used by people who use their Linux-based phones 
  as a &quot;daily driver&quot;, basically as their only smartphone. We 
  are very happy about that.

    You can disassemble Librem 5 using just a screwdriver. An easy to 
    repair phone is a sustainable option. 
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  <strong>Fani</strong>: I have seen references about sustainability in Librem5. At the 
  FSFE we are also dealing with sustainability in software. What do you 
  understand as a sustainable technology? What do you see as its main 
  challenges?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Guido</strong>: For me, technology that has been produced with sustainability 
  in mind allows the user to replace software and parts, as well as 
  repair the device over a long period of time without special 
  equipment.
</p>

<p>
  There are multiple challenges. For example, on the software side, you 
  need to make sure your kernel and userspace do not include any 
  non-free components, which is also worthwhile for privacy reasons. 
  Otherwise you might hit the end of life of your product because you 
  are not able to update to the newer, security-supported versions. 
  This happens every so often to Android devices. Users find they 
  cannot move to a newer kernel as the non-free, binary-only bits that 
  are needed to run the device are only available for older kernels.
</p>

<p>
  Finding or writing Free Software drivers can be very challenging, 
  especially when it comes to complex things like the GPU, as these are 
  very complex devices. Similarly for software components in the camera 
  stack. But having free drivers is a requirement for sustainability.
</p>

<p>
  On the hardware side, you want to make sure parts are easily 
  replaceable, that as little as possible is glued in and parts can be 
  replaced with mostly a screwdriver. <a href="https://docs.puri.sm/Librem_5/Disassembly.html">This is true in 
  Librem 5</a>.
</p>

<p>
  There are limits to sustainability. For example, to decode videos in 
  a power-efficient way your hardware needs to support this, as doing 
  it on the CPU takes way too much battery. When a new video standard 
  emerges on the web, you cannot always decode it in an efficient way. 
  The device will keep working but it might just not be as useful.

<p>
  <strong>Fani</strong>: Moving back to Librem 5 users and software adaptability: What 
  are the best hacks people came up with when using a Librem5 phone?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Guido</strong>: The thing that comes to mind is not something I would call a 
  hack, as it is an intended use case, but one of the most amazing 
  things is that <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/librem-5-laptop-mode/">you can turn it 
  into a &quot;laptop&quot; by using a dock</a>. So basically you carry 
  your phone and can attach it to a projector -- I have given talks at 
  conferences like that. Or you can hook it up to a &quot;dock&quot; 
  and it becomes a laptop-screen+keyboard, then you can add a usb-c 
  monitor and turn it into a &quot;full&quot; PC.
</p>

<p>
  People have used their Librem5 as a mobile hotspot to supply the 
  whole house when there was an outage on their cable line, or as a 
  loudspeaker as their laptops had bad audio quality, and have rerouted 
  the laptop audio to the phone via pulseaudio.
</p>

<p>
  Since you&#39;re not restricted by any means and you can install any 
  software, there are unlimited possibilities. I&#39;m so used to 
  everything being possible that I currently have a hard time thinking 
  of &quot;cool&quot; things as everything feels so natural already.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Fani</strong>: How does convergence, that is, the ability to have almost the 
  same OS in phones and laptops, as in PureOS, benefit software 
  development?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Guido</strong>: Since we are reusing lots of existing components, we benefit 
  from the stability of already existing Free Software solutions, as 
  well as being able to contribute back. For example, the libhandy and 
  libadwaita libraries are now part of GNOME and used by lots of 
  applications.
</p>

<p>
  Using mostly the same components across devices helps avoid developing 
  the same things twice, one for mobile and one for desktop. It allows 
  people with knowledge of desktop Linux to find their way around right 
  away, especially when it comes to configuration. It also allows them 
  to contribute more easily as it is the same technology stack.
</p>

<p>
  Developers, users, and sysadmins can use the very same 
  trouble-shooting tools they know, such as wireshark, perf, and 
  sysprof, across devices. And, if you find a bug and fix it on one 
  side, the &quot;other&quot; side benefits directly. It is really the 
  same software coming from the same source tree. As for users, 
  switching becomes very easy, as they will already be familiar with 
  the software.

<p>
  <strong>Fani</strong>: On a side note I would like to ask you about Bonn. You have 
  been active in the FSFE Bonn local group for many years. Do you 
  recall any fun local activities there?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Guido</strong>: In fact, one of the recent fun things is when we switched to 
  BigBlueButton meetings due to the pandemic. We had old friends from 
  Düsseldorf in the meetings who otherwise would not have made it to 
  the local meetings due to the distance.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE booth in FrosCon, a social event often staffed with people 
  from the Bonn group, is usually a highlight. I am glad this FrosCon 
  is on site again. However, I am not super active in the local group 
  at the moment, mostly due to time constraints.
</p>

<p>
  The local FSFE meetings often had a short talk about different topics 
  which is usually the best part since it pulls in more people, and 
  very often brings in new people. I hope we resume these when the 
  pandemic situation has settled down. Many people, including myself, 
  feel less inclined to prepare talks when it&#39;s &quot;only&quot; 
  online.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Fani</strong>: You work in Free Software development, and you are involved 
  with the FSFE. What keeps you motivated when it comes to supporting 
  software freedom and the FSFE?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Guido</strong>: It is really motivating for me that we can get to a point 
  where people can use a Free-Software-only device as their main phone 
  or laptop. Improving that keeps me motivated on the development side. 
  We cannot have free democracies without Free Software, hence doing 
  anything else is not time well-spent. It is also a reason why the 
  FSFE is important, as telling people about it and nudging decision 
  makers to embrace it is key.
