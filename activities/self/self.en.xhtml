    <p>
      SELF, an acronym for Science, Education and Learning in Freedom, was a
      research project formed by seven international partners and sponsored for
      a two year period by the European Commission.  The funded period ended
      in july 2008 and the project is now carried forward by the remaining
      partners of the project, where the FSFE continues to monitor and support
      the legal activities.
    </p>

    <p>
      The SELF project created the embryo for an online environment for the collaborative
      creation and sharing of educational materials and
      demonstrated its use by collecting and putting educational materials on
      Free Software and Open Standards into use on the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the platform is completed, it aims to support common operations such as the merging of
      learning materials, reuse, adaptation, editing as well as collecting
      learning materials into forms useful for specific courses. It will also
      provide the necessary tools for the translation of materials into other
      languages, and the use of materials in many different forms, such as
      course texts, presentations, e-learning programmes, e-books, educational
      audio and video, manuals and reference materials.

    <h3>FSFE Contributions</h3>

    <p>
      One seminal role of the FSFE inside the SELF project is to take care of
      all legal issues that may arise, as well as to form the Legal Expert
      Group to handle such regularly arising issues such as new licenses and
      legal maintainability of the platform. The legal work of the FSFE in the
      SELF project is done by our
      <a href="/activities/ftf/">Freedom Task Force</a>.
