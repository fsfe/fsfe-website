      <center><h1>Software Patents in Europe</h1></center>
      <p>
      Software patents for Europe are currently being pushed forward
      actively by a lobby gathering around the European patent office and
      the Business Software Alliance (BSA), which represents the interests
      of the large U.S. companies. Software patents are a menace to society
      and economy and the FSF Europe is actively involved in the resistance
      against such plans.</p>

    <h2>But why would anyone want them?</h2>

    <p>Software patents were seen as a convenient tool by large companies in
        the United States to defend themselves against competition:</p>

    <p class="quote">"If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of
    today's ideas were invented and had taken out patents, the industry
    would be at a complete stand-still today. [...]  A future start-up
    with no patents of its own will be forced to pay whatever price the
    giants choose to impose. That price might be high: Established
    companies have an interest in excluding future competitors."<br />William H. Gates, Internal Microsoft Memo (1991), [Fred Warshofsky, The Patent Wars (1994)]</p>

    <p>It should be understood that while the price of software patents is paid
        by all companies, big and small, the big ones can afford paying the
        price a little longer as they have deeper pockets. Also, they believe
        that it is worth the price to rid themselves of competition.</p>

    <p>Paying the price for the system, they obviously want their return on
        investment, which is why it is in particular the Business Software
        Alliance (BSA), a lobbying organisation for huge U.S. companies without
        European involvement, that has been pushing strongly for the adoption
        of software patents in Europe.</p>

    <p>Europe as a region is still gaining on the U.S. in terms of IT industry
        as it is free from the burden of software patents that the United
        States imposed on themselves.</p>

    <p>The small and medium software companies have made Europe a central
        player in innovation, while in the U.S., innovative software
        development is limited to a few monopolists.</p>
