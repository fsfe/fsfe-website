<h1>Revisiting Sony Rootkit 10 years later</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Imagine you buy a music CD in a store. You go home and put it into your
computer to listen to it. Without your knowledge a program is installed.
This program secretly checks whether you start programs to copy CDs, and if so forces
them to stop. It also slows down your computer and open security holes
which can be used by others to attack you. That is what happened 10 years
ago if you bought one of 25 million music CDs from Sony. This attack by
Sony on people's computers was discovered on 31 October 2005 and was later
referred as the "Sony rootkit" program. It affected more than 550,000 networks in
more than one hundred countries, including thousands of US military and
defense networks.</p>

<p>Sony's rootkit provides a very clear example what harm can occur when
companies try to control users' behaviour. Not only do these  restrictions
invade user's privacy, limit their property rights, and  open up their
computers to malicious attacks; these restrictions do not even achieve
their intended purpose of stopping piracy.</p>

<p>Even though the Sony rootkit is now 10 years old, hurtful digital restrictions are everywhere.
In recent news, the VW scandal provides another example of how restrictions
allow manufacturers manipulate software for their own benefit.</p>

<h2 id="facts-and-context">Facts and Contexts</h2>

<ul>
<li>The strongest characteristic of modern computing is that they are
universal machines; you can program them to do numerous tasks according
to the user's wishes. The diversity of their functions allows users to
discover new purposes and improve existing ones. However, companies who
produce digital products feel threatened by this. They want to limit what
we as a society can do with those machines in order to better fit their
old business model. </li>

<li>One way for content providers to control how users use their computers
is to implement technical restrictions on software, otherwise called
Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) or "Technological Protection Measures"
(TPM). These restrictions take away users' control over their own devices
and their rights to manipulate legally purchased content any way they want
to, in the name of protecting against unauthorised copying, or users' own security.</li>

<li>Restrictions remain an omnipresent characteristic of the modern age,
and October 31st commemorates a historic day in the rise (and temporary fall)
of digital restrictions. It marks the 10 year anniversary of the Sony BMG
rootkit fiasco.</li>

<li>On this day back in 2005, tech security expert Mark Russinovich
published his discovery on his blog <a class="fn" id="fnref1" href="#fn1">1</a>
about a piece of spyware, known as a rootkit, that secretly installed
itself on his computer when he added a recent Sony CD album to his computer.</li>

<li>When a Sony BMG CD was played on a computer, users would have to download
Sony's proprietary music player, in order to listen to the CD. Then Sony
installed a hidden rootkit program and used it to spy on users, their
listening habits, and share that information with Sony, as well as prevent
other third party audio programs from reading the disc.<a class="fn" id="fnref2" href="#fn2">2</a></li>

<li>The rootkit was secretively installed on user's computer operating
systems, and in the process created additional security flaws which opened
the doors for other, more malicious attacks. Even if user detected the
rootkit, safely uninstalling it without damaging your computer was another problem.<a href="#fn3" class="fn" id="fnref3">3</a></li>

<li>Sony BMG's president, Thomas Hesse, dismissed the issue completely,
and was quoted saying " Most people, I think, don't even know what a Rootkit
is, so why should they care about it?"<a href="fn4" class="fn" id="fnref4">4</a></li>

<li>Sony later had to reveal that the rootkit was loaded onto roughly 25
million CDs and infected more than 550,000 networks in more than one hundred
countries, including thousands of US military and defense networks.<a href="fn5" class="fn" id="fnref5">5</a></li>

<li>Naturally the public was outraged to learn what companies were
secretly doing to their personal property and Sony was forced to settle
numerous lawsuits and repair customers' trust as soon as possible. <a href="fn6" class="fn" id="fnref6">6</a></li>

<li>Despite the fallout of Sony's DRM experiment, 10 years later,
    restrictions on users' personal property are more prevalent than ever.
    But not just music or video downloads are restricted, restrictions are
    commonly found in legitimately purchased ebooks, video game hardware,
    and all manner of proprietary software. It has even found ways into
    our cars,<a href="fn7" class="fn" id="fnref7">7</a> and coffee machines.<a href="fn8" class="fn" id="fnref8">8</a>
    DRM is everywhere because software is everywhere. </li>

<li>Technological restrictions on the legitimate use of devices are
dangerous because they are slowly transforming our computers from being
general purpose machines with diverse capabilities, to being a singular
device with limited scope of power. Private companies limit computers'
functionality because it is better for business when users are locked in
to a particular service provider.</li>

<li>When  users are locked in by restrictions from content providers
and oppressive copyright legislation, society suffers because people
lose out on the possibilites of innovating and experimenting with new
products or services, as well as  their ability to fix and improve their
own devices. By trying to restrict the use of device or content for one
specific case (i.e. unauthorised copying or to prevent outsiders from
accessing the device), companies prevent to use computer for all other
legitimate purposes that users may be entitled to. This is a major
obstacle for future innovations and destroys the computer as a general
purpose machine. Furthermore, these restrictions do not differentiate
between legitimate or illegal manipulations performed on the computer
by its users, imposing blanket constraints on everyone. As a consequence,
no one beside the manufacturer has control over machines that control
our lives.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fsfe-demands">FSFE Demands</h2>

<blockquote>"We can't trust companies to always do what is best for society;
consumers, companies, organisations and governments need to be in control
of their own devices. We need to voice our opinions and support
legislation that empowers users with the right to tinker with their
own property" said FSFE's President Matthias Kirschner.

<p>He continues "As we commented on the EU Parliament's copyright reform
(Reda report), some progress is being made towards harmonising restrictions
exceptions in EU legislation that would make it harder for companies to
use digital restrictions on whatever technology they want. But there are
definitely improvements that can be made. Now we ask the Commission
to go even further along this path and make it clear that no exception
to copyright should ever be limited by DRM."</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>FSFE is calling on lawmakers to safeguard the right to tinker for
everyone The right to tinker makes sure that the owner of every device
is allowed to replace or supplement the software in that device if they
so choose, thereby empowering  owners to control their own property.
To ensure this protection, FSFE asks the Commission to propose legislation
strengthening computer owner's rights, by requiring that computer
owners must be enabled to modify and exchange the software and hardware
on any computing device they buy or otherwise have permanent possession
of, and afterwards have the right to sell it again.</li>

<li>Many manufacturers today add technological restrictions that
prevent device  owners from changing their devices, or having
someone do so for them.  This can be in breach of the licences on
the devices (as with Free Software/Open Source Software licences,
which grant the rights to use,  study, share, and improve the
software for any purpose). The right to tinker must also be coupled
with a legal provision  that prevents technological restrictions of
the same right. For this reason the FSFE asks the Commission to
propose legislation to ensure that consumers can make use of digital
goods which they have acquired within the full scope  of copyright
exceptions and limitations</li>
