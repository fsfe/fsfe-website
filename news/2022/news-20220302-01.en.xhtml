<h1>Online session: The future of Router Freedom in Austria</h1>

<p>
Austria introduced a reform law for the telecommunications sector which will affect the ability of consumers to choose and use their own routers and modems. Together with the Alliance of Telecommunication Terminal Equipment Manufacturers (VTKE) the FSFE is organising a session on "The Future of Router Freedom in Austria". 
</p>

<p>
The <a  href="https://vtke.eu/">Alliance of Telecommunication Terminal Equipment Manufacturers (VTKE)</a> and the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) are organising an online session over the future of Router Freedom in Austria. In the event, you will have the opportunity to learn more about why Router Freedom is fundamental not only for consumer rights but also for a functional and competitive router and modem market.
</p>

<p>
The event will be moderated by Barbara Wimmer, tech journalist in Austria, and is open for all to attend free of charge. The event language will be German. You can check the agenda <a  href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/Agenda%20RF%20Austria%20EN.pdf">here</a>.

<h2>Router Freedom in Austria</h2>

<p>
In October 2021, the Austrian Parliament passed the reform of the <a  href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXVII/I/I_01043/fname_997821.pdf">Telecommunications Act (TKG 2021)</a> with provisions affecting the ability consumers have to use their own device to connect to the Internet. With the new law, the <a  href="https://www.rtr.at/">Austrian regulatory agency (RTR)</a> can decide on the location of the Network Termination Point (NTP), a technical definition of the point that determines the boundary between the ISPs' public network and consumers' private network. Depending on the position of the NTP adopted, either ISPs will continue to be allowed to impose their own routers/modems on customers or internet users  will be able to choose their preffered router/modem for broadband connection.

<p>
The FSFE <a href="/news/2021/news-20210506-01.html"> urged the Austrian government</a> to include Router Freedom in the reform. Consumers's IT security, privacy and freedom of choice cannot be traded off in favour of ISPs' commercial practices. Besides, Router Freedom is important for market competition, device innovation and sustainability. It is now up to the Austrian regulatory agency to seize the opportunity to establish Router Freedom in Austria. Defining the NTP at point A will safeguard consumer rights.

<h3>The Router Freedom initiative</h3>

<p>
<a href="/activities/routers/routers.html">Router Freedom</a> is the right that consumers of any Internet Service Provider (ISP) have to choose and use a private modem and router instead of equipment that the ISP provides. Since 2013, the Free Software Foundation Europe has been successfully engaged with Router Freedom, promoting end-users' freedom to choose and use their own terminal equipment in many European countries. Join us and learn more about the several ways to <a href="/news/2021/news-20210330-01.html">get involved</a>. Please consider becoming a <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">FSFE donor</a>; you help make possible our long-term engagement and professional commitment in defending people's rights to control technology.
