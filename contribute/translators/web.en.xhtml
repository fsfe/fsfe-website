    <h1>Translating web pages</h1>

    <h2>Short Step by Step Guide</h2>

<p>This little guide should only be used if you already know the background of translations: How our pages are generated, how to find out which translations are missing or outdated and so on.</p>

<p>In this example, we want to translate https://fsfe.org/contribute/spreadtheword.en.html into Spanish.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Scroll down the page which you want to translate and find "Source code" in the footer.</li>

	<li>Download the .xhtml file (in this case https://fsfe.org/source/contribute/spreadtheword.en.xhtml).</li>

	<li>Write a short e-mail to translators@fsfeurope.org (you should already be subscriber of this mailing list) and tell them that you start with the translation.<br />
Please open for each new page a new thread and add your Country Code in the subject.</li>

	<li>Open the downloaded file with a text editor (gedit, Kate, Mousepad etc on Free operating systems, Notepad++ on Windows).</li>

	<li>Translate all english text outside the html tags into your language. For example:
&lt;p&gt;Hi there, please visit &lt;a href="https://fsfe.org"&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; should become<br />
&lt;p&gt;Hallo, bitte besuchen Sie &lt;a href="https://fsfe.org"&gt;unsere Webseite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</li>

	<li>Afterwards, please reply to your thread in translators@fsfeurope.org and ask other people to proofread your file. If everybody agrees, it will be uploaded by others on the mailing list.</li>
</ol>

    <h2>The detailed guide: Understanding how the web pages are built</h2>

    <p>
      The web pages of fsfe.org are maintained as a set of XML files.
      The web server generates the HTML pages from these XML files
      automatically every ten minutes. Consequently, all editing of the pages is
      done in the XML files, and the HTML is never edited directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every page on fsfe.org is named
      <var><em>pagename</em>.<em>language</em>.html</var> (<em>language</em>
      being the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">two-letter
      ISO-639-1 code</a> of the language, like "en" for English or "de" for
      German). The source files are named
      <var><em>pagename</em>.<em>language</em>.xhtml</var>.
	</p>

	<p>
      Some pages have a dynamic part. Apart from the fixed texts taken from the
      XHTML file, they include information from one or several XML files.
      Whenever such a page is built, the build system takes the translated XML
      files where available, and falls back to the English version of those
      XML files that have not yet been translated. This way, such pages
      can end up with parts of the text being translated and other parts still
      showing in English. Examples of such pages include the
      <a href="/index.html">start page</a>, the
      <a href="/news/news.html">news page</a>, and the
      <a href="/events/events.html">events page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Everybody can contribute translations</h2>

    <p>
      All source files (i.e. all XHTML and XML files) are publicly available
      for download, so everybody can spontaneously contribute a translation
      without having to register anywhere. However, whenever you start a
      translation and expect it to take longer, please write a short note to
      the <a href="http://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/translators">Translators
      mailing list</a> to avoid that somebody else starts to work on the same
      text simultaneously.
    </p>

    <h3>Contributing missing translations</h3>

    <p>
      If you have a page open in your web browser that has not yet been
      translated to your language, scroll to the end of the page, click on the
      <strong>Source code</strong> link and save the file you get there.  You will
      get the English XHTML file. Rename the file to carry your language code
      instead of the "en" code, and open it in a text editor. Now, translate
      all text in the file that is outside the "&lt;…&gt;" marks; do not
      change anything inside these marks (the text inside the marks are XHTML
      commands that influence the structure of the resulting web page).
    </p>

	<!--
	     Note to translators for the above sentence:
	     _structure_ not _appearance_.  XHTML = structure, CSS = appearance.
    -->

    <p>
      At the end of the file there will be a line saying <var>&lt;/html&gt;</var>.
      Immediately <em>above</em> this line, add a line saying
      <var>&lt;translator&gt;<em>your name</em>&lt;/translator&gt;</var>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are done, send the translated file to the
      <a href="http://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/translators">Translators
      mailing list</a>. Other members of this list can proofread the
      translation, and somebody on that list will ultimately post it to the
      server.
    </p>

    <h3>Updating outdated translations</h3>

    <p>
      If you have a page open in your web browser of which the translation is
      outdated (indicated by a note at the top of the page), scroll to the end
      of the page, click on the <strong>Source code</strong> link and save the file
      you get there.  This file is the (outdated) translated version. Next, use
      the <strong>English</strong> link at the top of the page to jump to the
      English version of the page and click on the <strong>Source code</strong>
      link there, too. The file you get there is the (up to date) English
      version. Now you can compare both files and update the translation.
      Please notice that everything inside the "&lt;…&gt;" marks may not
      be translated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, you may also use <a
      href="https://trac.fsfe.org/fsfe-web/browser/trunk">the web-based source
      repository</a> on the <a href="https://trac.fsfe.org/fsfe-web">fsfe-web
      trac site</a> to create diffs, and to see the latest updates for all
      source files.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are done, send the translated file to the
      <a href="http://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/translators">Translators
      mailing list</a>. Other members of this list can proofread the
      translation, and somebody on that list will ultimately post it to the
      server.
    </p>

    <h3>Finding out what needs work</h3>

    <p>
      There is an
      <a href="http://status.fsfe.org/web/translations.html">autogenerated
      list of all languages</a> available. On that page, each language code
      is a link to a separate page that lists all outdated and missing
      translations for that language.
    </p>

    <p>
      The list of outdated translations provides an extra feature helpful for
      updating: you can not only downlad the (outdated) translated file and the
      (up to date) English original; you can also view the changelog of both
      files, a protocol of all modifications done to the respective file.
      Comparing the two changelogs usually makes it easy to find out which
      parts of the original were altered since the translation was last
      updated.
    </p>

    <p>
      This translation status page is also the only way to download the XML
      files that are built into the dynamic pages, like files containing news
      items or event entries.
    </p>

    <h3>Downloading the complete source file tree with subversion</h3>

    <p>
      If it is possible for you to use subversion, you can also download the complete
      source file tree at once.  Please see the <a
      href="/contribute/web/web.html">FSFE webmaster information page</a> for
      detailed instructions.
