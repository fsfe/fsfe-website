       <title>7th Free Software Forum, Porto Alegre, Brazil</title>
          <body>
This year the 7th edition of the Free Software Forum will take place in Porto Alegre, Brazil. The event, arranged by the Associação Software Livre (in portuguese Free Software Association), aims to spread and to strengthen awareness and knowledge about Free Software and open standards.
              Georg Greve, President of FSF Europe, will once again participate in the 
              Free Software Forum. He will meet the local
              Free Software community and FSF Latin America, and give a talk about 
              "Free Software - Social Movement or Technological
              Revolution?".  Ciaran O'Riordan, FSFE's Brussels-based
              Free Software campaigner, will also be attending to talk
              on software patents and to help build the international
              Free Software network.
