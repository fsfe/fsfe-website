<p>2020 is not just a new year, it is the dawn of a new decade. With more and more automated systems run by software, a political representation of freedom is more needed than ever. Read in our January Newsletter about why Cory Doctorow supports the FSFE financially and why you should do so too. Read about our upcoming FOSDEM activities including our pre-FOSDEM meeting and reflections on our presence at the Chaos Communication Congress. Also we have a new Software Freedom Podcast with Harald Welte and reports from our community.</p>

		<p>2019 was a year full of successes for the FSFE and for <a href="/news/2019/news-20191022-01.html">Software freedom in Europe</a> accordingly. The Parliament of Asturias has signed our open letter demanding public code, the biggest conservative party in Europe -- the german CDU -- decided to foster Free Software, we managed to get an exclusion for Free Software in the EU copyright reform, and we have many more success stories to tell. But while we spent our time spreading software freedom in such a successful way, we missed one goal to achieve, that is having enough donations for 2020.</p>
		
		<p>Your financial support is crucial for our work! A secure financial basis gives us the ability to solely concentrate on our mission to spread software freedom in Europe - independent, professional and consistent. </p>
		
		<p><a href="https://my.fsfe.org/support">Join the FSFE as a supporter</a> or make a <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">one-time donation</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Every 1 Euro brings us closer to this momentum! Every 15 Euro allow us to send a package full of information material to a Free Software supporter in Europe. Every 50 Euro help us to pay our infrastructure and every 150 euro enable us to support travel and accommodation costs for a volunteer from Europe to participate in one of the FSFE community events like our hack-a-thons.</p>

		<p>By the way: Cory Doctorow, author of many digital rights-related books and co-editor of the blog Boing-Boing put the FSFE on the BoingBoing&#39;s charitable giving guide and explains: </p>

		<blockquote>Software has eaten the world, and software freedom is increasingly synonymous with human freedom. In Europe, far-right parties and authoritarians are inheriting a constellation of gadgets and devices that are "defective by design," built to allow corporations spy on and control their owners -- and those thugs are contemplating how they can use those companies' extraordinary powers to put whole populations under their thumbs. Free software in Europe, free software everywhere!</blockquote>

		<p>Europeans biggest Free Software conference &#39;FOSDEM&#39; is taking place on 1-2 February in Brussels. More then 7.000 participants are expected to come and the FSFE will be present with multiple talks and a booth. </p>
		
		<p>Matthias Kirschner, President of the FSFE, gives a talk about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/software_freedom/">&quot;The core values of software freedom&quot;</a> and a lightning talk about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/free_software_hackers_needed/">&quot;Civil society needs Free Software hackers&quot;</a>. Max Mehl, Programme Manager of the FSFE, talks about <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> in <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/reuse_code_licensing/">&quot;Go REUSE to license your code&quot;</a> and the FSFE&#39;s Deputy Coordinator France, Vincent Lequertier, talks about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/ai_in_peoples_hands/">&quot;Putting Artificial Intelligence back into people&#39;s hands&quot;</a>. </p>
		
		<p>As every year we will have a booth at FOSDEM, but unlike in previous editions, this time you will <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.8147&amp;mlon=4.3819#map=16/50.8147/4.3819">find us on top level of building K</a> - just upstairs from where it was in the past years.</p>

You can enjoy our latest merchandise and promotion material, for example <a href="/order/index.html#tshirt-multilingual-black">our new multilingual I love Free Software T-Shirts</a>.</p>
		
		<p>On Saturday night we invite you to come together after FOSDEM to have a social evening with our community. The location will be announced at the booth the very same day. Pass by and find out. Looking forward meeting you!</p>

		<li>The FSFE was present at the 36th Chaos Communication Camp (36C3) and one of the main organisers of the cluster &quot;about:freedom&quot; - a cluster that brings together civil society organisations with a focus on digital rights and Free Software advocacy at European&#39;s biggest hacking-related conference. In the four days of the event we had 19 self-organized session by the FSFE assembly, counted hundreds of visitors at our booth and we have created a cosy space for freedom activists to come together. On this occasion, Bonnie Mehring and Erik Albers have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhfLazPO7C4">interviewed by Komm:On</a> in their report about the congress.
