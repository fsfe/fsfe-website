          Android is a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html" title="Android and Users' Freedom">partially free</a> operating system
          developed mainly by Google. Unfortunately, the drivers for most
		  devices and most applications from the "market" are not
		  <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html" title="What is Free Software?">free (as in free speech, not as in no cost)</a>.
		  They frequently work against the interest of the users,
		  spy on them, and sometimes cannot even be removed.

          This campaign can help you to <strong>regain control</strong>
          of your Android device and your data. We collect information about
          running an Android system as free as possible and try to coordinate
          the efforts in this area. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Mobile devices are small computers that we carry around all the time.
        They know our current location and contain private pictures. We use
        them to communicate with our friends, our family and maybe our secret
        love. They also provide access to the internet and have built-in
        cameras and microphones. Being such powerful tools, they can bring great
        risks to privacy, but at the same time we can achieve great things
        with them: it depends on who controls them.
        </p>
      
        <h3 id="ReasonFreedom">Freedom and Control</h3>
      
        <p>
          Most mobile devices are not controlled by their users, but by the manufacturer
          and the operator. The software that runs on them is not Free Software.
          Even Android phones ship with non-free software and proprietary add-ons
          that often work against the interest of the user. Software
          updates are only made available as long as the manufacturer still has a
          commercial interest in your device. The applications (apps) available
          from the official market are commonly non-free. Nobody is
          allowed to study how they work and what they really do on your phone.
          Sometimes they just don't work exactly as you want, but oftentimes they
          even contain malicious features.
        </p>

        <p>
        Running exclusively Free Software on your device puts you in full control.
        Even though you may not have the skills to directly exercise all of your freedoms,
        you will benefit from a vibrant community that can do it together.
        </p>
      
        <h3 id="ReasonPrivacy">Privacy</h3>
        
        <p>
            Our mobile devices contain more personal information than most private
            diaries. But proprietary systems, even most Android phones, are designed
            to hand over this data to companies like Google or Apple. Most
            users do not have full control over the personal data on their device.
            Convenient solutions for synchronisation and data backup
            trick more and more people into storing all their data on centralised
            servers run by some profit-driven corporation. These are usually based in the US
            and are required to hand your data over to the US government on mere request.
            Whoever has personal information about us is able to manipulate us.
            Therefore, non-free devices are a threat to democracy and to our society.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Privacy is one of the most important reasons to support Free Software.
            Proprietary add-ons like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_IQ">Carrier IQ</a> spy on
            smartphone users without their knowledge. Many apps from the market
            contain malicious features. They read your private data, such as 
            <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/feb/15/apple-iphone-address-book-privacy" title="Apple faces US inquiry over iPhone address book privacy">your address book,</a>
            and "phone home", or they use
            <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/mobile/android.html#overview">Google Analytics</a>
            to send data to Google. These are just a few examples out of many that have been
            discovered so far. The lack of freedom impedes independent inspection
            and secret spy features only become known by accident.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most smartphones require you to connect and identify yourself to a
            centralised server before you can use them properly. Users have to trust
            the server without knowing what information is stored and how it is
            processed or related to other data. A phone running only Free Software
            does not require you to provide data to an untrustworthy company or
            pressure you to do so â€“ at least this is very unlikely, as the
            software's actions would be obvious and the community would be able to
            develop an alternative version. The convenience of "value-added"
            services that are often coupled with such connections can be provided
            using Free Software as well. This keeps you in control of your personal
            data. Your diary remains in your possession. You can have your cake and
            eat it too.
        </p>
    
        <h3 id="ReasonSustainability">Sustainability</h3>
        
        <p>
            Planned obsolescence is a serious problem that has both financial and environmental drawbacks. Every year,
            manufacturers produce 1.5 billion smartphones worldwide - and unfortunately, probably just as many are
            thrown away after what is usually a far too short hardware lifespan. E-waste increases every year.
            The energy required to produce the devices is extremely high, and the manufacturing and supply chain spans
            the globe several times. With Free Software, we address the problem by extending the hardware lifespan of
            phones and Android devices in particular!
            Learn <a href="/activities/android/sustainability.html">more about software sustainability on phones</a> and
            <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">about sustainability of Free Software</a>.
        </p>

    <h2 class="h3" id="discovering-free-software">Discovering the world of Free Software</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Free Software is what runs most of our digital infrastructure and our devices.</strong> The Internet
        heavily relies on the innovations and accessibility of Free Software. And during the last decade it also
        became of ever growing importance and availability on your phone.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Free Software comes with a lot of benefits.</strong> Free Software is available and can be used,
        studied, shared, and improved by anyone at any time. No restrictions involved. This is one of its core
        characteristics that in practice also helps to extend the usage lifetime of electronic devices - as <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html#hardware-production-and-usage-times">outlined in
        our study</a>. And Free Software is also good for your privacy. It helps you to keep control over your data.
        And, as you can see on this page, it also helps you to reduce e-waste and to upcycle your phone.
    </p>

        <h3 id="liberating-your-devices">Liberating your devices</h3>

        <p>
            Installing a completely different operating system in your original Android phone is liberating and reusing
            your device in one. Repurposing our devices this way is a practice that modern societies should be able to
            practise for all devices, helping us to live more freely in a more sustainable digital society.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember that your phone is a general purpose computer. With the legal right and technical empowerment to
            install any operating system that fits, you can reuse your phone not only as a phone but also for example as
            a connected device in your home environment, just as in any other setting of interconnected devices. And
            repurposing of our devices should not only be true for phones, but for any device with Internet access. That
            is why the FSFE demands the <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html#general-purpose-computers">right to use
            alternative operating systems and software</a> on any device. This would enable us to make full use of our
            hardware and to repurpose and reuse our resources in a sustainable way.
        </p>
      
	  <h2 class="h3">Other related initiatives</h2>

	  <p>
	    Even though this campaign is about Android, there are other
		initiatives that make it possible to use small mobile computers with
		(mostly) Free Software. Due to the driver situation of mobile
		hardware, none of these initiatives really can run such machines in
		freedom. Non-free drivers and firmware are needed for many peripherals
		to work.
