<p newsteaser="yes">Every year on 14th February, the Free Software Foundation Europe 
asks all Free Software users to think about the hard-working 
people in the Free Software community and to show them their 
appreciation individually on this "I love Free Software"-Day.</p>

<p><a href="/news/2014/news-20140221-01.html">Like last year</a> the 
campaign is dedicated to the people behind Free Software because they 
enable us to use, study, share and improve the software which enables 
us to work in freedom. Even more the focus especially lies on the small 
things.</p>

<blockquote><p>"When people think of the Free Software they need and 
admire, many think of large well-known applications. These softwares and 
the organisations behind it are very important indeed. But we should 
also think of the countless developers who spend their free or work 
time to write and improve the smaller bits of software we also rely 
on." says Max Mehl, this year's <a href= 
"http://ilovefs.org">#ilovefs</a> campaign manager. "Coders are no 
machines and their contributions deserve our respect and 
gratitude."</p></blockquote>

<p>For I love Free Software Day 2015 FSFE has several suggestions how 
to show one's love to the people behind Free Software, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pictures</strong> A picture is worth thousand words. The 
  Free Software Foundation Europe already <a 
  href="/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.html">collected some 
  images</a> of people showing how they express their support for Free Software 
  developers in public. That's a very individual way to 
  participate.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Postcards</strong> If you rather prefer to clothe your 
  thoughts in words the brand-new postcards enable you to do so. It's 
  either suitable for your valentine or for developers which software 
  you adore. The postcards <a 
  href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#ilovefs-campaign">can be 
  ordered</a> for free just like FSFE's other promotion material.</li>
  
  <li><strong>#ilovefs</strong> always had great online impact so FSFE 
  is once again looking forward to seeing a lot of messages on 
  microblogs, social networks, mailing lists, and blogs in a variaty of 
  languages.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Donations</strong> to developers and organisations 
  dedicated to Free Software are another way how to declare one's 
  appreciation. Invite them for a drink or donate to their projects, <a 
  href="/donate">to FSFE</a> or to <a 
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/DonateToFreeSoftwareProjects">other 
  supporters of Free Software</a>.</li>

</ul>

<blockquote><p>"Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives. It is
  important that this technology empowers rather than restricts us. 
  Free Software contributors give everybody else the freedom to use, 
  understand, adapt and share the software they have written. This way 
  the help to support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of 
  speech, freedom of press and privacy." says Matthias Kirschner, 
  FSFE's Vice President. "We should not underestimate the power of a 
  simple "thank you" to motivate them in their important work for 
  society. So say thank you on 14th February!"</p></blockquote>
