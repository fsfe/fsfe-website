		<div id="introduction">
		
		  <p>You found your way here, because - like us - you care about Free Software and digital civil rights. We need your help to spread the word about the advantages of Free Software, and to explain others why they should care about Freedom, too. Advocating for Free Software is fun and arguably one of the best ways to help the Free Software movement! On this page you find various material to support and help you in spreading the word: graphics to use, leaflets to print yourself and professional promotion material to order.</p>

		  </ul>
		</div>
		
		<p>All graphics you find on this page can be used to promote Free Software in general and the work of FSFE in particular. Feel free to copy, spread and use them as long as you avoid the appearance that - whatever you use it for - is an official product or the official opinion of the FSFE. Thank you very much for promoting Freedom!</p>

			<p class="right grid-70">This is the logo that represents the <a href="/fellowship/">Fellowship of the FSFE</a>. Its name is 'Plussy' and the symbol illustrates a human who stands strong for his freedom. At the same time, the human figure opens his arms to include everyone who shares common goals. Finally, the symbol draws a 'plus', because our movement gets stronger with every single identity. In other words, every one who is joining the Fellowship is a plus in the fight for freedom. That is why it is called 'Plussy'.</p>
