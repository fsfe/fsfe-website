    <h1>Information for Webmasters</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      The technologies and programs used to maintain the FSFE web page
      should already be familiar to many developers and authors and might be of
      interest to those that have not yet discovered them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Translators and occasional volunteers will most likely only get in touch
      with
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org" target="_blank">Savannah</a> -- for
        CVS (see below) services and access permission management
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/" target="_blank">XHTML</a> -- from
        which the static pages are generated every 5 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.cvshome.org" target="_blank">Concurrent Version
          System (CVS)</a> -- for co-ordination and synchronisation
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Volunteers interested in getting deeper into the maintenance should also
      be familiar with
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.perl.org" target="_blank">Perl</a> -- for the
        maintenance and page creation scripts
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache</a> -- as the
        web server
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Understanding how the web pages are built</h2>

    <p>
      The web pages of www.fsfeurope.org are maintaned as a set of XML files.
      The web server generates the HTML pages from these XML files
      automatically every five minutes. Consequently, all editing of the pages is
      done in the XML files, and the HTML is never edited directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every page on www.fsfeurope.org is named
      "<i>pagename</i>.<i>language</i>.html" (<i>language</i> being the
      2-letter iso-639 code of the language, like "en" for English or "de" for
      German). The source files are named
      "<i>pagename</i>.<i>language</i>.xhtml".<br />
      Some pages have a dynamic part: apart from the fixed texts taken from the
      .xhtml file, they include information from one or several .xml files.
      Whenever such a page is built, the build system takes the translated .xml
      files where available, and falls back to the English version of those
      .xml files that have not yet been translated. This way, such pages
      can end up with parts of the text being translated and other parts still
      showing in English. Examples of such pages include the
      <a href="/index.html">start page</a>, the
      <a href="/news/news.html">news page</a>, and the
      <a href="/events/events.html">events page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Registering at savannah</h2>

    <p>
      The source files for the web pages are stored on
      <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">Savannah</a>, a server hosted by the
      Free Software Foundation, our sister organisation in North America. To
      get write access to these files, you can create an account on that
      server.
    </p>

    <h3>Registering a new account</h3>

    <p>
      Follow
      <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/account/register.php">this link</a> to
      register a new account. Choose a login name, a password, fill in your
      real name and your e-mail address and click on the "Submit" button.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now you will receive a email from savannah. In order to complete your
      registration, visit the URL mentionend there. Accounts not confirmed
      after two days are deleted from the database.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After confirming your account, you can log in at
      <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/">https://savannah.gnu.org</a> with
      your login name and your password.
    </p>

    <h3>Creating an SSH key</h3>

    <p>
      While you can use the password to log into the web portal on Savannah,
      you have to register an SSH key to get CVS access. This has to be done on
      every machine from where you will access the CVS repository.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To create and register an SSH key, please follow the
      <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/faq/?group_id=5802&amp;question=User_Account_-_How_do_I_configure_my_SSH_access.txt">instructions
        given in the Savannah FAQ</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Joining the FSFE project</h3>

    <p>
      There are a lot of projects hosted on Savannah, and CVS access is granted
      on a per-project basis. To get access to the FSFE web page source files,
      you have to become a member of the FSFE project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Choose "Group Membership" in the top tabs. Now you can enter "FSFE" into
      the search box of "Request for Inclusion", activate the FSF Europe check
      box and enter a comment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The administrators of the FSFE project will then get a mail with your
      request and the comment you gave and can approve your membership in the
      project. After that you should see "FSF Europe" in the "Groups I'm
      Contributor of" after you login at savannah.
    </p>

    <h3>Checking out the repository initially</h3>

    <p>
      First you should make sure that your ~/.bashrc file contains a line
      saying<br />
      <code>export CVS_RSH=ssh</code><br />
      then create a directory for the repository and execute<br />
      <code>$ cvs -z3 -d <i>username</i>@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/web/fsfe co
        .</code><br />
      in that directory. Now you are asked for your SSH passphrase. Enter it
      and confirm. If everything is alright, now the website should be checked
      out.
    </p>

    <h2>Working with the repository</h2>

    <p>
      After you checked out the repository the first time, you should
      execute<br />
      <code>$ cvs update -d</code><br />
      in the fsfe directory every time before you work on a specific file.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you want to add new files to the repository you have to execute<br />
      <code>$ cvs add <i>filename</i></code><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      To post your changes to the server, no matter be it a new file or a
      modification in an existing file, execute<br />
      <code>$ cvs commit <i>filename</i></code><br />
      and an editor will open to allow for some description of your changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can download a detailed manual for CVS at the
      <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS home page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to keep track with all commits that are done to the web page
      sources, you can subscribe to the
      <a href="http://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/web-cvs-notify">CVS
        notification mailing list</a> and you will get a mail for every change
      posted to the source tree.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsible handling of write access</h2>

    <p>
      If you have write access to the web pages, please subscribe to the
      <a href="http://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/web">Webmasters
        mailing list</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please bear in mind that all your changes will become effective and
      visible automatically, without any further action of anybody.
      Consequently, there are a few things we would request you to do whenever
      you commit changes or new files:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The FSFE holds responsible for the content of the web pages. Please
          do not commit modifications that change the meaning of the text
          without approval from a
          <a href="/about/members.html">core team member of the FSFE</a>.
          (This is not necessary for translations of already existing content)
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          If you are posting translations, and there is any chance that others
          can proofread it, use that chance. You can use the
          <a href="http://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/translators">Translators
          mailing list</a> to ask for proofreading. Whether you are translating
          files or proofreading them, you are encouraged to spell-check files
          using some automated tools, such as GNU aspell, ispell, or your
          favourite spell-checker. For example, to use
          <a href="http://aspell.net/">GNU aspell</a> on a Debian GNU/Linux
          system, just install the packages <code>aspell</code> and
          <code>aspell-XX</code> (where "XX" is your language code), then run
          the command
          <pre>aspell -H -d language -c file.xhtml</pre>
          (where "language" is the name of the dictionary for your language;
          the <code>-d</code> option can be omitted if your UNIX locale is the
          same as the language of the dictionary).
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Make sure that all files are proper XML. There is a script named
          <code>tools/validate.pl</code> that helps finding errors in the
          markup. Improper XML breaks the automatic build process of the web
          pages and blocks updates for the complete FSFE web site. If you
          suspect the build process to be broken, you can view the log of the
          last build run <a href="http://status.fsfeurope.org/web/">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>validate.pl</code> script requires the
          <code>XML::LibXML</code> Perl module; if this is not installed on
          your system, you can validate files using your favourite XML
          validator. For example you can use the command line
          <code>xmllint</code> utility from the
          <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml2 project</a> (if you are using
          the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, install the
          <code>libxml2-utils</code> package); run the command
          <pre>xmllint --noout file.xhtml</pre>
          and watch for possible error messages.
        </p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>
          Make sure the encoding of the file is consistent with the content of
          the "encoding" attribute declared in the first line of the file. For
          example, if your file is encoded as "iso-8859-1" (also known as
          "latin-1" encoding), the first line of the file should read
          <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?&gt;</pre>
          Another valid encoding is the unicode, or "UTF-8" encoding. If you
          want to change the encoding of a file, you can use the standard
          <code>iconv</code> utility, as in the following example (which
          converts a file from the "latin1" to the "utf-8" encoding):
          <pre>iconv -f LATIN1 -t UTF8 inputfile &gt; outputfile</pre>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Please coordinate with other people who also have CVS commit access to
      make sure that translations and fixes contributed by people without
      commit access are committed properly after they have been proofread. Of
      course, please check these files before you commit them like you check
      your own files.
    </p>

    <h2>Further information</h2>

    <p>
      Given that the FSFE web page has a European/global level and
      user-chosen local levels that supplement them for information that is
      country-specific, the layout has a certain complexity that is hidden
      entirely from the user of the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless you only wish to translate pages (see below), please make sure you
      have taken a look at the
      <a href="Webpage-Structure.txt" target="_blank">structural
        reference</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, there is a
      <a href="http://www.texinfo.org" target="_blank">Texinfo</a>
      documentation file
      "<a href="/README.texi" target="_blank">Webmastering FSF Europe</a>" by
      <a href="mailto:oberg@fsfeurope.org">Jonas Öberg</a>, who implemented
      the build system for the page. Please read it to know more about how the
      web pages works.
