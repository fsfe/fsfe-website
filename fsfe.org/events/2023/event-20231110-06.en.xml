        <title>SFSCON '23 - The ZOOOM Framework: Legal aspects of FOSS and beyond in Bolzano, Italy (part of the ZOOOM project track)</title>

    <body>
      <p>License compliance efforts for software projects involve not only legal-oriented actions, but also governance elements such as organizational processes and community management. The larger the community or the organization working collectively, the more complex a compliance program for software projects may become. Free Software licenses being direct licensing models are easier to comply with in comparison to proprietary licenses.</p>
      <p>This talk, by Lucas Lasota and Niharika Singhal, will give an overview of the Free Software licensing compliance practices, including initiatives such as REUSE for streamlining copyright and license information for software projects.<br/>
