<h1>FSFE Newsletter - October 2013</h1>

<h2>Our movement turned 30!</h2>

<p>It was 30 years ago that Richard Stallman announced the <a
  href="/freesoftware/basics/gnuproject.html">GNU project</a>. An initiative
that started with a <a
  href="http://oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch01.html">programmer's frustration
  over a broken printer driver</a> has changed our society. The idea of
software that everyone can <a href="/about/basics/freesoftware.html">use,
  study, share and improve</a> has proven successful.</p>

<p>The GNU project has acted as the starting point of a movement that makes
sure we can control technology, and not technology controlling us. Today, Free
Software is everywhere: It powers the Internet, our mobile phones, televisions,
cars, routers, and electronic devices of all sorts. Free Software has
fundamentally changed the way people create software: instead of preventing
people to adapt the software to their own needs, they invite people to
participate in the development.</p>

<p>FSFE is grateful to Richard Stallman for sparking this epochal change, and
to everyone who has worked so hard to drive Free Software's progress for three
decades.</p>

<h2>Boost local activities: European Fellowship Coordinators Meeting</h2>

<p>During the last month our Fellowship group in <a
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Referat19September2013">Aarhus/Denmark held a
  talk</a> and the meetings in <a
  href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/guido/2013/09/fellowship-treffen-rheinmain-in-frankfurt-4-sep-2013/">Frankfurt/Germany</a>
are continuing. In <a
  href="http://www.softmetz.de/2013/09/23/freie-software-beim-corso-leopold-2-0/">Munich/Germany
  we had a public booth during a street festival</a>, during SFD Fellows
informed passers-by about Free Software in <a
  href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/franz.gratzer/2013/09/22/software-freedom-day-2013-in-vienna/">Vienna/Austria</a>
and in <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/fast_edi/?p=393">Offenburg/Germany</a>.
In <a
  href="http://coss.fi/2013/09/17/lauantaina-vietetaan-kansainvalista-avointen-ohjelmien-paivaa/">
  Helsinki/Finland</a> they helped others installing Free Software. Our
Düsseldorf Fellowship group was very active the last weeks. They had a booth at
the summer party of the <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/stehmann/?p=906">Pirate
  Party</a>, and attend the summer party of the  <a
  href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/stehmann/?p=925">Green Party</a>, held a <a
  href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/stehmann/?p=936">Software Freedom Day event</a>,
supported a <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/stehmann/?p=916">Cryptoparty in
  Kempen</a>, held a <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/stehmann/?p=946">regular
  meeting</a>, as well <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/stehmann/?p=884">as a
  talk by Sam Tuke about Free Your Android</a>.</p>
    
<p newsteaser="yes">From 27-29 September 22 Fellows from FSFE from 10 countries
gathered in Berlin for the first European Coordinators Meeting. During the
weekend the coordinators get known to each other, presented their work, talked
about problems to promote Free Software, shared good practices, and provided
valuable feedback about our campaigns. If you are interested to see who is
promoting Free Software on the local level in Fellowship groups <a

<h2>Something completely different</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Technology should be a means to freedom and creativity. Yet governments
  around the world are turning computers and networks into tools of oppression
  FSFE <a href="/news/2013/news-20130923-01.html">joined a coalition of more
    than 265 organisations</a> which launched a list of 13 International
  Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communication
  Surveillance.</li>

  <li>Ask Your Candidates: Our Austrian team <a
    href="/news/2013/news-20130926-01.html">published their questions and
    answers for the Nationalratswahl (federal election)</a>, and the German <a
    href="/news/2013/news-20130918-01.html">published the
    answers to similar questions for the state elections in Hessen</a>.</li>
  
  <li>After <a
    href="http://fsfe.org/activities/policy/eu/20130729.EC.Fairsearch.letter.en.html">FSFE
    already spoke up against it</a>, KDE also rejected the Fairsearch
  initiative claims, and <a
    href="http://dot.kde.org/sites/dot.kde.org/files/KDE-Fairsearch-claim-response_0.pdf">stated
    why Free Software is competitive</a>.</li>

  <li>There is a <a
    href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/guido/2013/09/free-software-in-education-news-august-2013/">
    new edition of the Free Software in education news for August</a>.</li>

  <li>FSFE <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/mk/?p=1124">wrote a letter to the
    German Federal Network Agency</a> (Germany). Together with Mirko Vogt from
  OpenWrt we argued about the importance of having the freedom to run the
  router you want to have for your internet access.</li>

  <li><a href="http://ohwr.org/cernohl">CERN has update its Open Hardware
    License</a> to version 1.2.</li>

  <li>To celebrate GNU's 30th anniversary, FSF suggested <a
    href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu30/gnu-a-day">30 software freedom actions</a>
  you can take in a month. It was meant for September, but can of course be
  repeated anytime.</li>
  
  <li>Public administration: the <a
    href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/french-gendarmerie-open-source-desktop-lowers-tco-40">French
    Gendarmerie now maintains 37,000 GNU/Linux desktops</a>, and after the
  planed switch next summer it will be 72,000. They say they are able to lower
  the total cost of operation by 40% compared to the proprietary solution. But
  the savings are just one point, the other is more vendor independce.</li>

  <li>From the <a href="http://planet.fsfe.org">planet aggregation</a>: </li>

    <li>Georg Greve argues that software freedom advocates had it right all

      proprietary cryptography, or proprietary software</a>.</li>

    <li>Lucile learnt <a
