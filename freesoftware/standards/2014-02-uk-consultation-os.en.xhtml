    <h1>Submission to UK Open Standards Proposal 2014</h1>

    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
        This is FSFE's submission to the <a href="http://standards.data.gov.uk/proposal/sharing-collaborating-government-documents">UK Open 
        Standards Proposal</a>, held by the Standards Hub in Cabinet Office, 
        submitted on 28th January 2014.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <a href="/">Free Software Foundation Europe</a> has long
      advocated the use of Open Standards in government. We applaud this
      proposal by the UK government.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most governments are suffering the effects of lock-in in their IT
      infrastructure: high costs, dependence on a single ultimate supplier,
      no strategic freedom. This all but eliminates meaningful competition
      among suppliers, and stifles technological progress. In addition,
      these governments often end up imposing on the citizens they serve
      (and on other organisations they cooperate with) an obligation to
      acquire the same non-free programs that the government uses.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast, the UK government stands out not just for its
      determination to break free and make real competition among suppliers
      possible, but also for having an integrated strategy for doing so. The
      present proposal is a central building block of this strategy, along
      with a clear and strong <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles#open-standard---definition"
      >definition of Open Standards</a>, the recently announced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-draws-the-line-on-bloated-and-wasteful-it-contracts"
      >red lines</a> for IT contracts, and other elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      We applaud the UK Government's approach of focusing on standards
      rather than products, and relying on a strong definition of Open
      Standards to ensure that there will be significant competition among
      suppliers for any software products that the government may wish to
      use.
    </p>

    <p>
      An important feature of the present proposal is that it relies on a
      thorough and comprehensive <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/01/29/government-documents-understanding-what-users-need/"
      >study of the actual user needs</a>. This greatly increases the chances 
      that the proposal can be successfully implemented, and that any new tools
      deployed will be well matched to the requirements of their users.
    </p>

    <p>
      The proposed standards (HTML (4.01, 5 or higher); TXT; CSV; ODF (1.1
      or higher)) each address a different technical need. The UK Government
      is correct in focusing on a single Open Standard for each category and
      purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Competition takes place on top of standards, not between them.
      Especially with regards to documents produced in office suites,
      concentrating on a single Open Standard will ensure that all suppliers
      can compete on an equal basis. In the mid to long term, the demand
      created by the UK government, and any others following in its
      footsteps, is bound to lead to significant improvements in the way
      office suites work - an area where progress has been all but absent
      for about a decade.
    </p>

    <p>
      We agree with Francis Maude's assessment, from a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/sprint-14-speech-by-francis-maude"
      >speech</a> delivered on January 29 this year, that "the adoption of open
      standards in government threatens the power of lock-in to proprietary
      vendors yet it will give departments the power to choose what is right
      for them and the citizens who use their services."
    </p>

    <p>
      In closing, we reiterate our support for the UK Government's proposed
      approach. Ultimately, any strategy is only as good as its
      implementation. We would thus like to express our hope that the
      government will follow through on implementing this approach across
      all of its branches. FSFE remains available to support this effort.
    </p>
