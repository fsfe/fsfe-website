<h1>Medical Devices Should Use Free Software +++ 25 New Videos</h1>

<p>
  In this issue we have a podcast episode about the need that medical 
  devices have Free Software. Watch our talks from FOSDEM and videos 
  about legal issues when developing. Participants of YH4F are already 
  coding. Thanks to all your contributions, our fundraising ended 
  successfully. We bring community news from 9 countries.

  Karen Sandler relies on a medical device to keep her heart pumping. 
  She had a critical moment when her defibrillator misread her 
  condition and she had no access to tweak the device. Since then, 
  Karen has been on an odyssey to persuade doctors and manufacturers to 
  embrace software freedom in medical devices. She recalls a case of a 
  neurotechnology company that ended its support of retina implants. 
  Despite such cases, things can improve in healthcare as more tech 
  savvy people need medical devices. <a href="/news/podcast/episode-19.html">Listen to
