	  <title>Zurich Fellowship meeting</title>
    <body>
	    There will be a Fellowship meeting at the FSFE Zurich office from 18:00 until 19:00 on Friday the 21st of November.  Some free (as in beer) beer will be provided and all Fellows nearby are invited to attend.  It will be a good chance to get to know each other in person, to discuss ways of spreading the word about Free Software in Switzerland, and to generally have a good time.  This meeting will be hosted by Graeme West, FSFE's intern at the Zurich office. If you plan to come to the meeting please let Graeme know by sending an email to west@fsfeurope.org.
