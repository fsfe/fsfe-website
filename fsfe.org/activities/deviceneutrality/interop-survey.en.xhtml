    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
       Are you a Free Software developer trying to access hardware or 
       software features under Article 6(7) of the Digital Markets Act 
       (DMA)? We want to hear from you! Share your experience about how 
       gatekeepers are handling your interoperability request.

  <p>The <a
  href="https://survey.fsfe.org/index.php/699938?lang=en">FSFE’s
  Interoperability Survey</a> aims to collect structured feedback from 
  Free Software developers, also known as “access seekers”, about their 
  experience requesting interoperability under Article 6(7) of the 
  Digital Markets Act (DMA). This article requires designated 
  “gatekeepers” to provide, free of charge, access to the software and 
  hardware features of their Core Platform Services (CPS). The goal is 
  to foster innovation and support alternative solutions developed by 
  the Free Software community.</p> 

<h2>The Digital Markets Act and Interoperability</h2>
<p>The <a href="http:///activities/dma/dma.html">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a> is a
landmark European regulation aimed at curbing the power of large digital
platforms. Under the DMA, these companies must allow interoperability
with their software and hardware features, promoting competition,
innovation, and user choice.</p>

<p>Specifically, <strong><strong>Article 6(7)</strong></strong> empowers
developers to request access to technical functionalities that were
previously restricted. This creates new opportunities for Free Software
projects, and for users to benefit from greater choice and control. </p>
This provision opens the door for Free Software alternatives to services currently dominated by gatekeepers, such as payment systems, app stores, or messaging platforms. Free Software is contained in 90% of today’s technology and its relevance is therefore crucial in a fair and just implementation of the DMA.

<h2>Why Your Input Matters</h2>
<p>
At the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), we are committed to 
making sure these rights are not just theoretical. We are gathering 
first-hand experiences from developers who have submitted, or are 
planning to submit, interoperability requests to gatekeepers such as 
Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others. For a complete list of all 
gatekeepers and their designated Core Platform Services visit this <a 
href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/gatekeepers_en"></a>page.
</p>


<p>Your insights will help us:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Identify common obstacles for Free Software and patterns of non-compliance.</li>
<li>Report issues to the European Commission.</li>
<li>Advocate for enforcement that supports Free Software and small
developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether your request was accepted, denied, delayed, or ignored - we
want to hear from you!</p>

<p>Gatekeepers’ compliance is not automatic. Many Free Software
developers still face vague procedures, delays, or rejections. Others
may not know how or where to start their request. By sharing your 
experience, you help strengthen the case for clear, fair, and 
developer-friendly implementation of the DMA. Together, we can ensure 
that these new rights translate into real-world opportunities for Free 
Software.</p>
