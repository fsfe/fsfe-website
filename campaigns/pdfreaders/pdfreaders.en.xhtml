<p>What would you think about a sign on the highway saying “You
      need a Volkswagen to drive on this road. Contact your Volkswagen
      dealer for a gratis test drive -- Your Government”? When it comes
      to software that opens PDF files, many public sector organisations
      do this every day.  With the pdfreaders.org campaign we have turned
      the  spotlight on government organisations who behave in this way,
      exposing how frequent such advertisements for non-free software are.
      With the help of activists across Europe,
      <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/follow-up.html">we contacted</a>
      these organisations and explained to them how to improve their
      websites so that they respect our freedom.</p>
</div>
<h2>Why should we care?</h2>

    <p>Even when a certain software is given away for free, the company
    behind it can have an economic gain: promoting that software means
    prioritising a specific company. Public bodies should not promote
    any specific private company, instead they should promote equality
    and choice on the software market. That is why FSFE and its volunteers
    intervened to fix the problem.</p>
    
    <p> This campaign was based on three core principles we support at FSFE:</p>
	<p><ul>
		<li>Neutrality - Public institutions should not engage in
		advertising</li>
		<li>Freedom - Public institutions should not ask citizens to use
		non-free Software</li>
		<li><a href="http://fsfe.org/activities/os/def.en.html">Open
		Standards</a> – The versions of the PDF format which are Open
		Standards can be implemented by all PDF readers</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <h2>What did we achieve?</h2>

    <p> Every day, public institutions advertise non-free software on 
    their websites. Some examples are below.

</a>
</p>
    <p>With the help of our Fellows and of hundreds other Free Software
    activists, we collected
    <a href="http://fsfe.org/campaigns/pdfreaders/buglist.html">2104 bug
    reports</a> over the course of one month from every country in Europe, 
    and also nine countries outside of Europe. </p>
    
    <p>Next, the FSFE and its volunteers
    sent letters to all the public administrations on our list asking
    them to either remove their advertising for proprietary  software,
    or to at least run equal advertising for Free Software, so  that
    users of their websites realise that they have a choice.</p>
    
    <p>Now, several years, and thousands of letters later, the FSFE has
    closed the campaign. Thanks to all the dedicated Free Software
    activists who helped contact institutions, we can proudly announce
    that  we were able to remove advertisements for proprietary PDF
    readers in 1125 or the 2104 public administration websites (53%).
    Furthermore, we were able to push for a change at both national and
    international levels.</p>

	<ul><li> In Germany, 
    <a href="http://gruen-digital.de/2012/03/document-freedom-day-kleine-anfrage-zur-werbung-fuer-adobe-reader-eingereicht/">national parties</a>
    gave statements in favor of free PDF readers and the German Government
    itself has recommended the usage of our text snippet in their
    <a href="http://www.cio.bund.de/Web/DE/Architekturen-und-Standards/Migrationsleitfaden-und-Migrationshilfen/migrationsleitfaden_node.html">migration guide</a>.
    </li>
    <li> In the EU: the European Parliament 
    <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/parliamentary-questions-eu.en.html">directly asked</a>
    the European Commission what were the reasons for advertising a 
    specific software and which steps were taken to solve this problem.</li>
    <li> In 2011 one of our pfdreaders.org coordinators contacted Google,
    asking them to release
    the PDF reader included in their Chrome browser as Free Software.
    Some years had to pass, but finally the answer came in May 2014 with
    the <a href="https://twitter.com/nasko/status/469595752734269440">
	publication of the pdfium sources</a>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

 <p> In addition to contacting public institutions to resolve the  issue,
     FSFE also collected signatures from 90 organisations,  63  businesses,
     and 2731  individuals who demanded equal access for Free  Software 
     PDF readers.This wide-ranging support also demonstrated the  
     popularity of the  campaign overall.

<h2>What's next?</h2>
    <p> The Free Software movement is, above all, supported by its 
    community; we always need your help to continue to help promote 
    free PDFreaders, and together we can make a difference for the 
    future of  Free Software!  We encourage you to continue to send 
    <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/letter.html">letters</a> or emails to
     public bodies that are still adverstising for proprietary software 
     and closed standards. We also have a link for
     <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/follow-up.html">how to</a> contact 
     the relevant institution. This is a great (and easy) activity for
     local Fellowship groups to help with our 
     <a href="/activities/policy/eu/policy-goals.en.html">public bodies policy goals</a>
