    <title>5th International GPLv3 Conference, Tokyo</title>
    <body>
      The 5th international conference on GPLv3 will be a 2-day event
      held in Japan on November 21st and 22nd.  Organised by Free
      Software Initiative Japan, this event will host experts and
      interested parties who will make presentations and participate
      in discussions about Free Software's cornerstone licence.  FSFE
      will be represented by Georg Greve (President) and Ciar√°n
      O'Riordan.  The joint goals are to maximise awareness of the
      GPLv3 process and to give attendees the information necessary to
      make informed comments on the licence drafts and to help them to
      explain the proposed changes to others.
