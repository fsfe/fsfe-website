    <h1>The European Legal Network Conference - Business Tickets</h1>
     
    <div id="introduction">

    <p>
The European Legal Network Conference is held every year to allow legal experts to discuss the future of Free Software licenses and associated best practice in this field. This has become the world's premier event for debating, discussing and sharing knowledge around Free Software legal affairs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
As in previous years, the primary cost of holding the event is expected to be covered by sponsorship.  However, FSFE offers attendees a way to support the facilitation of the Legal Network through a business ticket priced at 300 Euro.  This provides access to our dinner on the night of the 7th and an invoice for accounting purposes.
    </p>
    
        <p>
You can order your business ticket by credit card, bank transfer or cheque as described below.
