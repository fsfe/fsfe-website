  <h1>Software shapes society. Free Software improves it.</h1>

  <p>
    Watch our new video demonstrating how different practices in software lead
    to different models of society. Software is intangible, but its results
    often are not. The decisions we make about what type of software we use have
    real-life effects. There is a type of software that benefits the common
    good, and that is Free Software.

      If you ever looked for a video that explains the values of Free Software
      in three minutes, look no further.

  <p>
    The transparency and adaptability of <a href="/freesoftware/index.html">Free
    Software</a> enhance cooperation, inclusivity, and self-determination. This
    leads us to a society with stronger democratic procedures and community
    spirit. "The difference between Free and proprietary software is that Free
    Software always grants us four rights: <strong>any person may freely use,
    study, share, and improve the software</strong>. If software is developed
    under a free license, then anyone can use it without restrictions,
    anytime and anywhere. Since the source code can be read by anyone, this
    allows for more transparency and can lead to more security. People can work
    together across borders on problems that affect humanity; they can share the
    software, discuss it, and improve it collectively."

  <p>
    For our <a href="/activities/20years/20years.html">20th anniversary</a> we
    have produced this video so more people can learn what software freedom
    entails. If you want to dive deeper into this, the script of the video is based on
    a <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/software_freedom/">talk
    at FOSDEM 2020</a> given by Matthias Kirschner, President of the FSFE. It
    reflects the core values of software freedom and pleads for more respect and
    diversity in Free Software communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please share the video with your friends so that they can also learn what
    Software Freedom is about.
