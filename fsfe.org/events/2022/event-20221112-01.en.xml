        <title>Upcycling Android workshop at the SFSCon in Bolzano, Italy</title>

    <body>
      <p>Many Android users are suffering from not receiving any updates to their default operating system any more. But there is not need yet to toss your device away! The problem can be solved by installing a Free Software operating system called “custom ROM” on your device. We gather to talk about the issues arising from software obsolescence in the Android world and help each other in flashing devices. You can bring your own but we will also bring some devices to tinker around so you can gather experience with flashing your phone. We focus on installing CalyxOS but we are open for your input.</p>
      <p>There will be a short introduction talk on the relationship between hardware and software lifespans, followed by a flashing session of a sample phones. At the end and during the workshop we will answer questions about flashing and there will be the possibility to explore sample phones. The workshop takes place in the context of the SFSCon, on Saturday 12.11.22 from 09:00 - 12:00 hours in the NOI Techpark in Bolzano, Italy.</p>
