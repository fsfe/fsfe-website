	  <title>'How SELF helped building structures for freedom' speech at FKFT</title>
    <body>
  SELF has contributed on various levels to freedom in software and
  education. The work of the SELF Legal Experts Group (LEG) has helped
  to evolve a better understanding of Open Standards and provided a
  reference line for free educational materials. The coordinator of the
  SELF LEG, FSFE president Georg Greve, will provide an insight on how
  SELF has helped advance the state of the art, and how the work done in
  the SELF consortium will provide lasting benefit to the Free Software
  community.
