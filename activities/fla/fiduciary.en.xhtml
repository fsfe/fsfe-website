        <h1>Fiduciary Programme</h1>

        <p>The FSFE has in the past acted as the legal guardian of Free Software projects, under our Fiduciary Programme. The
    Fiduciary Programme allows projects to use the <a href="/activities/fla/fla.html">Fiduciary
    License Agreement (FLA)</a> to assign copyrights to FSFE, allowing the
    consolidation and effective management of their copyright status. It allows
    developers to focus on making great applications rather than dealing with
    legal administration. Adopters of the FLA include KDE e.V. (KDE), which has been using the FLA as its preferred form for assigning copyright to KDE since 2008. The FSFE has in the past assisted KDE with their adoption of the FLA in several ways.</p>

        <p>
         As part of the Fiduciary Programme, the FSFE made sure that projects are in a strong legal position without being
    prescriptive. The FSFE dictated neither project policy nor project management.
    </p>

    <p>
    Unfortunately, FSFE is no longer accepting new projects under the 
    Fiduciary Programme at the moment. Nevertheless, you can still use customisable 
    versions of the Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA) in order to consolidate
    your copyright under your own administrative umbrella.  We have a page
    containing customisable versions of the FLA <a href="/activities/fla/fla.html">here</a>.
    </p>
