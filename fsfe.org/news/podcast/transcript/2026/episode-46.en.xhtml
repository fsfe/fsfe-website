00:00.000 --> 00:16.600
Hello and welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.600
This podcast is brought to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:20.600 --> 00:25.600
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology and I'm Bonnie Mehring.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.400
Today I'm here with Dr. Lucas Lasota from...

00:29.400 --> 00:31.400
I'm trying to pronounce the correct, okay?

00:31.400 --> 00:38.200
The Chest Transition Center of the Martin Luther University of Halle, Wittenberg.

00:38.200 --> 00:42.600
Lucas is also in part-time working for the free Software Foundation Europe.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.600
So we are also co-workers.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.200
Yeah, thank you so much Lucas for making it.

00:46.200 --> 00:50.600
Thank you so much for being here and yeah, taking the time at Foster.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.000
It's a great pleasure to be here and I thank you very much, Bonnie.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.200
It has been a pleasure here.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.600
All right, how are you and how has Foster been so far?

00:58.600 --> 01:05.000
Well, I think you can guess from my voice that Foster is always like that.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.400
Very intensive, almost overwhelming, but very inspiring and very energizing.

01:12.400 --> 01:18.400
And it gives us this energy to keep going for software freedom for the entire year.

01:18.400 --> 01:23.600
I can imagine, I can imagine, it gives you a bit of a blast, but it's also like really exhausting at the same time.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.000
I have to take some days after Foster for sure.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.200
Well, I'll highlight so far like anything that you think, oh, this was really inspiring.

01:31.200 --> 01:35.200
This is the thing that will give me some energy boost for the next weeks.

01:35.200 --> 01:42.800
So, as you know, at the university and at FSFE, I mainly work with policy and legal issues.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.400
And during the whole year, these issues are very emotionally demanding, if you will,

01:48.400 --> 01:51.400
because you are always dealing with problems.

01:51.400 --> 01:59.000
Well, if people don't have problems, then we don't need the law and regulation on relation to problems.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.600
And during the entire year, you get accustomed to the challenge all the time.

02:05.600 --> 02:11.400
Now we are involved with platform regulation, Apple, Google, Microsoft.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.200
There's a lot of challenges for free and open source software.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.000
But here in Foster, you see the power of the community.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
And you see this thousand of developers.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
And you see their engagement, you see their excitement to produce alternatives

02:25.000 --> 02:29.600
to allow people to control technology, you know, to put forward software freedom.

02:29.600 --> 02:36.600
So I think my highlight to Foster is this energy boost that helps me keeping with my legal and policy work for the rest of the year.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.000
I can't imagine, I can't imagine.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
If so many people come together, there's like this energy that is accelerating between all of them.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.600
And it's like, yeah, it's amazing.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.200
I think for anyone based in Europe, even outside Europe,

02:51.200 --> 02:57.800
if you have the privilege and to visit Foster, I think even from anthropological point of view,

02:57.800 --> 03:02.000
I think it is a very, yeah, very rewarding experience.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.600
Again, imagine, but today, even so I would love to continue this conversation.

03:06.600 --> 03:12.200
We won't be talking about Foster, but we will be talking about the question,

03:12.200 --> 03:23.200
can the Digital Markets Act help to protect Free Software developers working with the Android Open Source project in short AOSP?

03:23.200 --> 03:24.200
Right?

03:24.200 --> 03:28.000
Yes. It's a very difficult question and happy to discuss with you today.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.200
I'm also happy and I will, I'm really looking forward to find out what you think about it.

03:33.200 --> 03:42.000
Before we dive into the topic, can you vary briefly outline your connection to the Digital Markets Act and how you came in contact with this?

03:42.000 --> 03:47.400
Yes. So a primer about this, why we're talking so much about this law.

03:47.400 --> 03:52.600
And if anyone goes to FSFE.org and go to the search function and put Digital Markets Act,

03:52.600 --> 03:56.000
you're going to see a lot of this stuff being published on this.

03:56.000 --> 04:09.600
Because we do think this is a very important regulation that can push to the adoption of free and open source software in critical aspects of our mobile devices,

04:09.600 --> 04:16.600
especially in relation to alternative app stores, browsers, search engines, operating systems.

04:16.600 --> 04:21.000
And because the main goal of this law, and this is an European Union law,

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
that came into force in 2024, is to promote more competition in digital markets.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.600
That's why Digital Markets Act, you know.

04:28.600 --> 04:40.400
And the situation with the Drupal Apple slash Google over mobile ecosystems has been so intense and so entrenched that the regulators in Europe said

04:40.400 --> 04:47.000
we need to do something about it, we need to inject more competition in their markets and we need desperately for alternatives.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.600
And look, Bonnie, yesterday I was in a very nice talk from our colleague who is listening to this podcast.

04:53.600 --> 04:58.600
I highly suggest going to the Boston website and search for Gabriel Ku Wei Bin.

04:58.600 --> 05:02.600
And he gave a primer on the legal aspects of free and open source software.

05:02.600 --> 05:10.000
And he also gave us a historical, very short historical development of the movement from the legal perspective.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
And copyright establishes a monopoly when someone creates a creative work.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.600
So think about a book, think about software, a music.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.000
The creator has a monopoly over that work.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Sometimes it's good, you know, because you wanted to have control about the work that you have.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.600
But sometimes this monopoly can be overstated, you know.

05:30.600 --> 05:37.400
And the main core of the Free Software movement was to disintermediate this monopolies.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.600
Then that's why we created a copy left.

05:40.600 --> 05:46.800
So the Free Software licenses is a medium to disintermediated monopoly over software.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.400
And we have been doing this for 40 years, right?

05:49.400 --> 05:54.800
And therefore this law that came in 2024 is just a next step on this fight.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.600
It's just a next step on this type of work.

05:57.600 --> 06:03.000
We are not concerning with copyright only, but we are concerning now with platform regulation.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.200
We are concerned about digital markets, right?

06:05.200 --> 06:14.800
And therefore this law is a trench where the FSFE and anyone that cares about Free Software should be involved.

06:14.800 --> 06:20.800
Because we really want to allow people to control technology, to control our mobile devices.

06:20.800 --> 06:27.800
And sometimes it's not possible without regulation because the situation becomes so disadvantages for Free Software developers,

06:27.800 --> 06:32.200
even for end user customers, not customers, I'm sorry, end users, right?

06:32.200 --> 06:33.800
Thank you.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.800
That without regulation we cannot do anything more about it, you know.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.800
Was this what you were thinking like when you were at the DMA, you were like,

06:41.800 --> 06:49.200
oh, this will be an next step to help end users to be more empowered.

06:49.200 --> 06:55.400
And that monopolies are not that much in the, in the power of controlling everything.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.400
Was this what you were thinking like when you read it?

06:58.400 --> 07:01.400
Yeah, that's a very good summary, yes.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.400
How did you feel about this?

07:02.400 --> 07:07.400
Were you like really inspired or were you like, I hope that this works out?

07:07.400 --> 07:09.400
Well, that's a very good question.

07:09.400 --> 07:18.400
I mean, when I jump out the bed every day, I think I have to think, well, this will go on our workout.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.400
Well, I hope it will work out.

07:20.400 --> 07:26.400
But this brings me to the question because we already touched a bit on the monopoly side.

07:26.400 --> 07:33.400
So it's now over 20 years ago that Google acquired the Android open source project, right?

07:33.400 --> 07:40.400
And your work of the University of Halle-Wittenberg, you did also study on Google

07:40.400 --> 07:46.400
and especially the policy shift in regard to AOSP.

07:46.400 --> 07:53.400
So in the study, you wrote the AOSP has served as a baseline not only for diverse commercial versions

07:53.400 --> 08:02.400
of Android-based operating systems, but also for alternative, non-profit community-driven versions of operating systems.

08:02.400 --> 08:09.400
Can you walk me through what happened like before Google took this policy shift in 2025

08:09.400 --> 08:16.400
and yeah, how Google has seen or how Google's role as a gatekeeper to be precise?

08:17.400 --> 08:23.400
Yeah, so just about some organizational aspects about this study before we move forward,

08:23.400 --> 08:25.400
this study has not been published yet.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.400
So we submitted this study to a publication in a legal journal.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
So this study has not been published.

08:30.400 --> 08:35.400
What we have is a working version that we already discussed in a conference.

08:35.400 --> 08:40.400
And this version that you have access is an internal one that we shared on this conference.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.400
And I'm happy to discuss this working version that you have.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.400
But this is not the official version that will be published yet,

08:47.400 --> 08:52.400
because we are waiting for the feedback of the peer review that we submitted.

08:52.400 --> 09:00.400
But I would like you to provide just a context on this study and why this is important work that we have been doing.

09:00.400 --> 09:08.400
Because in the last three years, my research work and also my work at the FSFE has been dealing with Apple.

09:08.400 --> 09:13.400
Apple has taken a very aggressive approach against this law,

09:13.400 --> 09:18.400
because this law tries to open up an infrastructure from Apple

09:18.400 --> 09:22.400
and to allow more competition on App stores, browsers,

09:22.400 --> 09:25.400
allowing interoperability for Free Software,

09:25.400 --> 09:31.400
not only for software, but Apple is questioning this whole law

09:31.400 --> 09:34.400
and saying that this law is in constitutional law,

09:34.400 --> 09:36.400
you know, it's not proportional.

09:36.400 --> 09:41.400
But sometimes we forget that there are other companies that this law applies to.

09:41.400 --> 09:46.400
And one of these companies are Google and other companies are Microsoft, Amazon,

09:46.400 --> 09:48.400
looking at their others.

09:48.400 --> 09:56.400
But the problem with Google is that how Google relates to this law is a little bit more nuanced than Apple.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.400
Apple has a very strong adversarial position against this law.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.400
But Google, since, as you already mentioned, in the beginning of this podcast,

10:04.400 --> 10:08.400
Google is responsible for the Android open source project.

10:08.400 --> 10:13.400
And Android open source project is a fundamental part of the Android operating system.

10:13.400 --> 10:23.400
And the Android operating system is the most popular and the most used operating system in the world, you know, by far, you know.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.400
And...

10:25.400 --> 10:27.400
You mean like on smartphone?

10:27.400 --> 10:28.400
Yeah.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.400
In mobile devices, right?

10:29.400 --> 10:36.400
So comes Android in the first place, then iOS in the second place and together, together,

10:36.400 --> 10:42.400
they have more than 99% of the entire market of mobile operating systems.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.400
We, of course, know we are from the Free Software community.

10:45.400 --> 10:49.400
We know that there are many others, alternatives, operating systems,

10:49.400 --> 10:53.400
that the Android base are not Android boys, they're the Linux phones, several of them.

10:53.400 --> 10:57.400
You know, but their part on the market are very thin, you know,

10:57.400 --> 10:59.400
that's less than 1%, unfortunately.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.400
And we want to change that.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.400
But today's topic is about Android.

11:04.400 --> 11:08.400
Perhaps we can do a podcast in the future about Linux phones.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.400
We did one. We did one in the past.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.400
I will link it on the show notes.

11:11.400 --> 11:12.400
Oh, that's a great, yeah.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.400
But we did one in the past.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.400
That's super cool.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.400
But...

11:16.400 --> 11:19.400
And Android, as you said, right?

11:19.400 --> 11:20.400
I would like to...

11:20.400 --> 11:25.400
Well, I'm old enough to remember 2007 the expectations we had.

11:25.400 --> 11:31.400
And Android, when Android came into the market, it was a blast, I remember.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.400
Everyone would like to have an Android phone.

11:34.400 --> 11:38.400
Because before that we were having kind of smartphones,

11:38.400 --> 11:41.400
but the smartphones, they were very limited in their capacity

11:41.400 --> 11:45.400
because they pre-installed apps just from the manufacturer.

11:45.400 --> 11:49.400
And Android came with this promise, you know, with this potential

11:49.400 --> 11:54.400
that you could install any software that you would like on your phone via the app store.

11:54.400 --> 11:59.400
And this would turn your smartphone as truly a general-purpose computer,

11:59.400 --> 12:03.400
you know, and you would have these awesome apps that you don't have in your PC

12:03.400 --> 12:07.400
because, well, the smartphone comes with other hardware functionalities.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.400
There's a camera, there's telemetry, there's a microphone,

12:10.400 --> 12:16.400
and you could bring software to a whole other level of experience and functionalities.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.400
And...

12:17.400 --> 12:20.400
I never looked at a smartphone like this,

12:20.400 --> 12:23.400
and now I feel like, oh, yeah, this is how I felt when I came in.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.400
That's how I felt when I got my first smartphone.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.400
Now everybody knows that I'm a bit older.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.400
Right.

12:29.400 --> 12:39.400
And I think Google understood the power of opening up their infrastructure

12:39.400 --> 12:42.400
to these type of contributions.

12:42.400 --> 12:47.400
Academically speaking, on a little bit more on the theoretical speaking,

12:47.400 --> 12:51.400
this strategic move has a name for it.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.400
It's called the power of the network effects.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.400
And what is the network effects?

12:57.400 --> 13:02.400
It means that any network, the value of this network,

13:02.400 --> 13:06.400
increase proportionally to the size of this network.

13:06.400 --> 13:10.400
So the bigger the network is, the more value it has.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.400
And that's why today, both Apple and Google,

13:14.400 --> 13:18.400
they don't want to lose control over their app stores

13:18.400 --> 13:23.400
because the app stores now it's a huge network of apps.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.400
And this network brings a lot of money to them.

13:26.400 --> 13:31.400
But aside from this, what really disrupt the market,

13:31.400 --> 13:34.400
in the end of the first decade of 2000s,

13:34.400 --> 13:37.400
we were talking about 2007 here, right,

13:37.400 --> 13:42.400
was when they opened up their infrastructure for apps,

13:42.400 --> 13:45.400
this disrupt completely the market,

13:45.400 --> 13:48.400
the dispute out of the market.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.400
Symbian, Nokia, they put out the palm.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.400
Remember palm, palm was super chic.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.400
So you're very young.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.400
No, I feel young again.

13:59.400 --> 14:04.400
But palm devices were the crème de la crème in the past.

14:04.400 --> 14:09.400
And they disrupted it.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.400
Now they're in museums.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.400
So Apple followed this,

14:15.400 --> 14:19.400
and they also opened up their infrastructure

14:19.400 --> 14:21.400
for external contributors.

14:21.400 --> 14:26.400
So the first version of the iPhone came without an app store.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.400
And there was what the first app store was,

14:29.400 --> 14:31.400
a free and open source one called CD.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.400
You could not install apps on it.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.400
No, no, the first version of the iPhone was completely closed

14:36.400 --> 14:39.400
and it came only with pre-installed apps.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.400
The first app store was a CD was a free and open source software.

14:42.400 --> 14:46.400
And two years later I don't know,

14:46.400 --> 14:50.400
Apple changed the operating system in order to block CD.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.400
And now the only way to install external software

14:54.400 --> 14:57.400
on smartphones were via their own app store.

14:57.400 --> 15:01.400
So the control over app stores already has a long history,

15:01.400 --> 15:03.400
a very long history.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.400
So why am I saying all of this?

15:06.400 --> 15:09.400
Because Google did one step further

15:09.400 --> 15:11.400
to not only open the app store,

15:11.400 --> 15:14.400
but to open the entire operating system.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.400
So they opened the operating system to free and open source.

15:17.400 --> 15:20.400
So Android, it is, well, at least, you know,

15:20.400 --> 15:23.400
parts of it, a free and open source project.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.400
There is one, which is licensed into the app 82.

15:26.400 --> 15:31.400
But the history doesn't end there, you know.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.400
And it would be very easy to say,

15:33.400 --> 15:38.400
yes, we have the most successful free and open source project of all time

15:38.400 --> 15:41.400
because billions of people are using it.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.400
But the history unfortunately doesn't end there.

15:44.400 --> 15:50.400
And Google has excerpt control over iOSP in different forms,

15:50.400 --> 15:53.400
not only via the licensing aspect.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.400
And we can talk about this.

15:55.400 --> 16:01.400
How to control iOSP in a way that would hinder software freedom

16:02.400 --> 16:05.400
to others to exercise this traditional way

16:05.400 --> 16:10.400
that we see software freedom in such powerful ways

16:10.400 --> 16:15.400
and anti-competitive ways that in 2018,

16:15.400 --> 16:20.400
you know, Google got record fines from the commission

16:20.400 --> 16:24.400
because of this anti-competitive practice.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.400
I can imagine what was this fine about

16:26.400 --> 16:30.400
and like what was this EU commission saying there?

16:30.400 --> 16:34.400
So Google's strategy was a pretty clever one in the beginning

16:34.400 --> 16:36.400
so they open up the platform.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.400
And then suddenly, you know, if you were a manufacturer,

16:40.400 --> 16:43.400
if you were a smart one manufacturer,

16:43.400 --> 16:48.400
then you could adapt the functionalities

16:48.400 --> 16:51.400
of your devices to the operating system.

16:51.400 --> 16:55.400
And this was something truly revolutionary, you know.

16:55.400 --> 16:59.400
Because manufacturers, they always have the problem of

16:59.400 --> 17:01.400
the chicken and egg, you know.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.400
If you want a successful device,

17:03.400 --> 17:06.400
you need this operating system for it.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.400
But then, in order to have an operating system,

17:09.400 --> 17:11.400
you need a device for it.

17:11.400 --> 17:17.400
Let's put this on a context.

17:17.400 --> 17:21.400
Recently, I met some folks from risk five.

17:21.400 --> 17:25.400
Risk five is an open hardware specification for chips

17:25.400 --> 17:30.400
and they were telling their talks exactly this problem.

17:30.400 --> 17:34.400
They wanted to find a device that would enable them

17:34.400 --> 17:37.400
to have risk five, you know,

17:37.400 --> 17:40.400
and having this open architecture on laptops,

17:40.400 --> 17:43.400
but then they have to find an operating system for this.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.400
And so it took several years for them,

17:46.400 --> 17:50.400
but yeah, Ubuntu agreed and then they found also a device manufacturer.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.400
But anyway, so let's go back to 2007.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.400
In 2018.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.400
No, no, I started with 2008.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.400
2018 is the fine, right?

17:59.400 --> 18:00.400
Yes, it is.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.400
Until we got there.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.400
So manufacturers were facing this problem.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.400
You know, and they said, okay.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.400
Okay, I have this cool device,

18:08.400 --> 18:09.400
but I need an operating system.

18:09.400 --> 18:13.400
But the operating system is very expensive to develop.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.400
You know, think about how many hours of work you need

18:16.400 --> 18:18.400
to have a cool operating system.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.400
And then you have apps.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.400
You need to add the apps.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.400
And then the apps should run on the operating system.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.400
And you know, how are we going to do this?

18:25.400 --> 18:29.400
You know, so Google came with a solution for this.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.400
And they said, look, we will have Android.

18:31.400 --> 18:35.400
Android will be open and you will be able to adapt your devices

18:35.400 --> 18:37.400
to have Android running on it.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.400
So they really solve this problem

18:40.400 --> 18:43.400
for many, many, many, many manufacturers.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.400
You know?

18:44.400 --> 18:46.400
So manufacturers, okay, cool.

18:46.400 --> 18:50.400
But then here comes the trick.

18:50.400 --> 18:51.400
You know?

18:51.400 --> 18:54.400
And I would like to introduce here in our talk

18:54.400 --> 18:56.400
how Android is organized.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.400
The Android stack, right?

18:58.400 --> 19:02.400
Because the Android stack is where Google exerted it

19:02.400 --> 19:06.400
and exerced control over OSP until today.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.400
You know?

19:07.400 --> 19:11.400
And this also what led the European Commission 2018

19:11.400 --> 19:14.400
to establish records finds.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.400
You know, it was really.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.400
I don't have the, I forgot the numbers.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.400
But I may be wrong.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.400
You can check.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.400
But it was on the billion scale.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.400
That's quite a lot of money.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.400
Very.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.400
Because with this, what I'm going to say right now,

19:28.400 --> 19:33.400
Google was able to lock in entirely all the manufacturers

19:33.400 --> 19:35.400
on the Android ecosystem.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.400
So by opening up the operating system layer

19:38.400 --> 19:41.400
to free and open source software,

19:41.400 --> 19:45.400
Google was able to immediately attract millions and millions

19:45.400 --> 19:49.400
of, you know, the developers that were interested

19:49.400 --> 19:52.400
into contributing to the platform that was already, you know,

19:52.400 --> 19:53.400
exploring.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.400
They said, okay, we're going to be there.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.400
And they were also able to attract the manufacturers.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.400
So they were able to bring together.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.400
And this is what makes a platform good.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.400
A platform brings different sides together.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.400
And Google did this with Android.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.400
Android is a platform.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.400
Yeah.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.400
So that other device manufacturers could use Android

20:12.400 --> 20:16.400
and just use, have a bit of a customized version.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.400
But they are then also part of this.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.400
And Google is like there providing the services.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.400
Yes.

20:22.400 --> 20:23.400
But here's the trick.

20:23.400 --> 20:27.400
Because as soon as you license your operating system

20:27.400 --> 20:30.400
as free and open source software,

20:30.400 --> 20:34.400
this gives them the permission to market, you know,

20:34.400 --> 20:38.400
they can market and they can have their own version of it.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.400
Right?

20:39.400 --> 20:42.400
And well, we could have.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.400
Right?

20:43.400 --> 20:46.400
And I think this is the beauty of free and open source movement.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.400
We can have, you know, many, many of them.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.400
Right?

20:49.400 --> 20:53.400
But then, and this only became clear in 2018.

20:53.400 --> 20:57.400
Because, you know, it was in 2018, where the world understood

20:57.400 --> 21:02.400
how Google have this strategy around our speed that, you know,

21:02.400 --> 21:06.400
that didn't allow alternatives to strive.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.400
How they have to network and control, basically.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.400
Yes.

21:10.400 --> 21:16.400
And so via agreements with manufacturers, side agreements, right?

21:16.400 --> 21:19.400
So it was not on the license, you know,

21:19.400 --> 21:23.400
it was side agreements on the compatibility side.

21:23.400 --> 21:27.400
You know, so Google said, okay, so we wanted to be compatible

21:27.400 --> 21:28.400
with Android.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.400
You know, we have to sign this agreement with me, this side agreement.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.400
So we have the license here on one hand,

21:33.400 --> 21:36.400
but there is the agreement on the other hand.

21:36.400 --> 21:41.400
And these agreement, there were clauses forbidding manufacturers

21:41.400 --> 21:43.400
to fork Android.

21:43.400 --> 21:46.400
So it was called anti-forking agreements.

21:46.400 --> 21:51.400
You know, if you are, if you decided to fork Android,

21:51.400 --> 21:56.400
then you would not be allowed to install the Google suite.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.400
And what is the Google suite?

21:58.400 --> 22:01.400
Google suite is their Google Play Store.

22:01.400 --> 22:06.400
The security aspects of the Play Store, you know,

22:06.400 --> 22:11.400
and all the apps that Google in the old history has developed

22:11.400 --> 22:16.400
and has acquired YouTube, Chrome, and many, many other apps

22:16.400 --> 22:20.400
that people, well, they like to have on their smartphones, you know.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.400
You mean like the Google services that they...

22:22.400 --> 22:26.400
The Google services, the Google service, you know.

22:26.400 --> 22:31.400
And this was a very strong, disincentive

22:31.400 --> 22:34.400
and very strong threat to manufacturers, you know.

22:34.400 --> 22:41.400
Otherwise, they would go back pre-2007 when they had to develop

22:41.400 --> 22:44.400
their own operating system, you know.

22:44.400 --> 22:49.400
And it's super, super cool.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.400
I mean, cool in one hand as a researcher to read about it,

22:52.400 --> 22:55.400
but in other hand, it's very sad.

22:55.400 --> 23:00.400
But because they were managed to keep basically

23:00.400 --> 23:04.400
the entire ecosystem of Android manufacturers

23:04.400 --> 23:07.400
into this very strict locking.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.400
Until 2018, when the Commission said,

23:10.400 --> 23:14.400
man, this is super anti-competitive, you know.

23:14.400 --> 23:18.400
And there's a problem there, you know.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.400
And on a side note, it's very interesting,

23:21.400 --> 23:25.400
because you can read several analysis in 2007

23:25.400 --> 23:31.400
that historically, Microsoft was able to do this

23:31.400 --> 23:34.400
with laptops of computers.

23:34.400 --> 23:37.400
And in 2008, the vice manufacturer said,

23:37.400 --> 23:40.400
we don't want it to have a Microsoft 2.0 in our lives.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.400
And that's why we need an open source solution.

23:43.400 --> 23:46.400
And Google came with an open source solution,

23:46.400 --> 23:48.400
but Google were able to...

23:49.400 --> 23:54.400
But on the positive side of things, you know,

23:54.400 --> 23:57.400
not to be standing that the device manufacturers

23:57.400 --> 24:03.400
got locked in in this environment, you know.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.400
The nature, the free open source nature of iOSP

24:07.400 --> 24:11.400
allowed for fork if you were not a manufacturer.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.400
So, you know, if you don't have a device

24:13.400 --> 24:16.400
and you don't want it to enter in these compatibility agreements

24:16.400 --> 24:19.400
with Google, you could fork, you know.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.400
And you could create custom ROMs.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.400
Yes, exactly.

24:22.400 --> 24:26.400
What changed then with the release of Android 16?

24:26.400 --> 24:30.400
So, what, like, this was before 2025.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.400
But what happened afterwards, like, with Android 16,

24:33.400 --> 24:35.400
there was a policy ship.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.400
Yes.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.400
Precisely.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.400
And this is completely related now to alternative ROMs.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.400
And what is alternative ROMs?

24:42.400 --> 24:46.400
For audience, audience that is hearing this term for the first time.

24:46.400 --> 24:50.400
You know, technically, this is not a correct term

24:50.400 --> 24:53.400
to alternative ROMs, because we're not talking about ROMs,

24:53.400 --> 24:54.400
precisely.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.400
But basically, alternative operating systems

24:56.400 --> 24:57.400
that are based on Android.

24:57.400 --> 25:01.400
So, there is Android stock that is developed and controlled by Google.

25:01.400 --> 25:06.400
But then you can fork this and then you can make your own customized,

25:07.400 --> 25:10.400
you know, altered version of Android.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.400
There are several of them.

25:11.400 --> 25:15.400
You know, there are the very privacy-oriented ones like Grafino AS,

25:15.400 --> 25:20.400
there are ones that are intended to allow a great deal of compatibility

25:20.400 --> 25:23.400
with different types of devices like LanoAjo AS.

25:23.400 --> 25:27.400
There are other ones like Morena, EOS.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.400
There are many of them out there.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.400
Many, you know.

25:30.400 --> 25:33.400
We also have them with the free-your-and-work initiative.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.400
We have a page.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.400
We can link that in the show and other people can look it up.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.400
Yeah, yeah.

25:38.400 --> 25:41.400
So, they come in different flavors.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.400
But I think security and privacy are the main drivers.

25:44.400 --> 25:48.400
People, they want their Android devices to be a little bit more secure

25:48.400 --> 25:54.400
than they search for these alternative Android operating systems.

25:54.400 --> 25:58.400
But again, I would like to highlight that these are not Linux phones.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.400
They depend on Android.

26:00.400 --> 26:06.400
And they depend on how information is made available on Android.

26:06.400 --> 26:12.400
And this shift that you just mentioned is Google hindering

26:12.400 --> 26:17.400
a big deal of interoperability information inside OSP

26:17.400 --> 26:24.400
that can create a big struggle for these alternative ROMs to survive.

26:24.400 --> 26:28.400
You know, so it's basically enclosing,

26:28.400 --> 26:35.400
it's a step on enclosing more of a OSP restricting these alternative ROMs.

26:35.400 --> 26:40.400
And together with my research group, we work on this,

26:40.400 --> 26:43.400
we think that this is not compatible with this law

26:43.400 --> 26:46.400
that we mentioned in the beginning of our podcast, Digital Market Act.

26:46.400 --> 26:50.400
We do believe that interoperability, mandating this law is very broad.

26:50.400 --> 26:56.400
And this shifts what answering is that Google is stopped to provide

26:56.400 --> 27:01.400
some type of information that are very important for alternative ROMs.

27:01.400 --> 27:06.400
For example, interoperability information regarding the device,

27:06.400 --> 27:09.400
called the device trees, interoperability information

27:09.400 --> 27:14.400
regards to the source code history, you know, and also hardware drives.

27:14.400 --> 27:19.400
So this were type of information that Google decided to hinder

27:19.400 --> 27:23.400
or to publish later, sometimes they blocked,

27:23.400 --> 27:25.400
but sometimes they decided to publish later.

27:25.400 --> 27:30.400
So it created barriers for these alternative operating systems

27:30.400 --> 27:34.400
to compete with Google stock Android.

27:34.400 --> 27:38.400
This does this, like, hinders them to continue to developing

27:38.400 --> 27:43.400
those alternative ROMs or will there be a way around?

27:43.400 --> 27:46.400
Like, because you did some any research,

27:46.400 --> 27:50.400
you highlighted, you did some interviews with developers,

27:50.400 --> 27:52.400
as far as I understood.

27:52.400 --> 27:55.400
And like, what was their reaction towards this?

27:55.400 --> 28:01.400
So their reaction was quite negative and very worrisome.

28:01.400 --> 28:05.400
And they're saying this puts high loads on us

28:05.400 --> 28:09.400
to reverse engineer this type of information.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.400
And the thing is that outside of this law,

28:12.400 --> 28:15.400
this would create already competitive issues.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.400
But then the difference between competition law

28:18.400 --> 28:21.400
and this particular law, the DMA that we're talking about,

28:21.400 --> 28:26.400
is that in competition law, we need to wait until we see the harm.

28:26.400 --> 28:30.400
So we have to wait some years, and then...

28:30.400 --> 28:35.400
Oh, yes, indeed, there are some harm in the community.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.400
But this law is different.

28:38.400 --> 28:41.400
There is already a do-and-don't list.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.400
We don't need to wait.

28:43.400 --> 28:46.400
I think that blocking this type of interoperability information

28:46.400 --> 28:48.400
is already against this law.

28:48.400 --> 28:52.400
And that's why we tried to build a legal argument for this.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.400
Look, we do believe that inside Google,

28:55.400 --> 28:59.400
there's a lot of people that believe in free and open-source software.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.400
Google is a company that was founded on these ideals.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.400
They have a very strong Ospo.

29:05.400 --> 29:09.400
They have a very strong food on the community.

29:09.400 --> 29:12.400
And therefore, we do believe that this type of work

29:12.400 --> 29:16.400
helps them to re-evaluate their practices

29:16.400 --> 29:22.400
and to let alternatives inside the free and open-source movement to thrive.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.400
I hope it will.

29:24.400 --> 29:28.400
But was this also like the researchers in the interviews also see this?

29:28.400 --> 29:33.400
Or was it more like that they are afraid that they will have to stop?

29:33.400 --> 29:36.400
I mean...

29:36.400 --> 29:38.400
Sorry, not researchers, but developers.

29:38.400 --> 29:41.400
Yes, exactly.

29:41.400 --> 29:46.400
So I think that when you depend on a platform,

29:46.400 --> 29:51.400
any platform, there is an imbalance.

29:51.400 --> 29:55.400
And this is normal in any platform.

29:55.400 --> 30:02.400
Unless the platform is really democratically governed.

30:02.400 --> 30:05.400
But otherwise, there is always this imbalance.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.400
And we are trying...

30:07.400 --> 30:08.400
Like the hierarchy.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.400
Yes.

30:09.400 --> 30:13.400
And we are trying with regulation to level a little bit more the playing field.

30:13.400 --> 30:18.400
So at least we can have alternatives inside this ecosystem.

30:18.400 --> 30:22.400
So end users can choose and can have more competition among themselves,

30:22.400 --> 30:26.400
among alternative ROMs and stock Android itself.

30:26.400 --> 30:33.400
So I really don't want to have only one provider of Android.

30:33.400 --> 30:39.400
I think Android is a marvelous technological speaking operating system.

30:39.400 --> 30:44.400
And since it is fundamentally free and open source on its core,

30:44.400 --> 30:47.400
I think that this alternative ROMs they should thrive.

30:47.400 --> 30:52.400
They should allow people to have alternatives to install on their Android devices.

30:52.400 --> 30:59.400
And this is the goal of our work in the DMA is to inject more competition into Android ecosystem.

30:59.400 --> 31:04.400
Do you think there is an actual chance that a DMA can help us here to predict

31:04.400 --> 31:08.400
Free Software developers or is it a two-flastiger?

31:08.400 --> 31:09.400
No.

31:09.400 --> 31:14.400
No, I do think it's a viable instrument to search for.

31:14.400 --> 31:18.400
But look, it's not a miracle's instrument.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.400
Nowadays, in the EU...

31:20.400 --> 31:23.400
I want to have that because make it like that.

31:23.400 --> 31:26.400
Look, we are talking about digital sovereignty.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.400
We are talking about democratization.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.400
We are talking about the next generation of the internet.

31:30.400 --> 31:34.400
We are talking about the future of the web.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.400
The DMA is only one instrument.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.400
And I am a legal person.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.400
And that's why I talk a lot about the DMA.

31:40.400 --> 31:46.400
But if you go to any other strategist in the FSC in my research group at the university,

31:46.400 --> 31:49.400
there are people looking into other aspects.

31:49.400 --> 31:55.400
So we need to talk how to fundamentally change digital markets to a more democratic one.

31:55.400 --> 31:58.400
But DMA can help certainly, but alone it cannot do.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.400
So we need funding for Free Software.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.400
We really need funding for Free Software.

32:02.400 --> 32:06.400
And not only VC type of fund, we need a really public money type of fund

32:06.400 --> 32:11.400
that will enable collective effort on our society to Free Software.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.400
That is a public good.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.400
Free software is a public good.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.400
It's digital commons.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.400
Think about a park in our city.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.400
Think about a highway.

32:20.400 --> 32:23.400
Think about a railroad.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.400
They are public.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.400
And Free Software is the same.

32:27.400 --> 32:31.400
So therefore, we need to diversify the sources of funding.

32:31.400 --> 32:36.400
We need to diversify the strategy in order to make the digital markets more democratic.

32:36.400 --> 32:40.400
DMA can help, but we need many, many other venues and instruments.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.400
I absolutely agree.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.400
We need strategic and long term funding, especially.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.400
So it does not need to be short term.

32:46.400 --> 32:49.400
It needs to be really long term so that others can rely on it.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.400
And that it will be there.

32:51.400 --> 32:54.400
What's the European Commission's perspective on this?

32:54.400 --> 32:59.400
Do you know if they think they will act up on the shift in the Google policy?

32:59.400 --> 33:01.400
Yes, we will talk with them.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.400
They are monitoring this.

33:03.400 --> 33:10.400
And we are also monitoring their activity on this.

33:10.400 --> 33:18.400
A very good news I can share is that last week the European Commission started a new regulatory process

33:18.400 --> 33:26.400
to help Google to comply with the digital markets act in relation to interoperability and AI.

33:26.400 --> 33:30.400
AI falls a little bit out of scope of what we are talking about here,

33:30.400 --> 33:36.400
but the interoperability part for sure is included on the scope of this.

33:36.400 --> 33:40.400
And we will make sure on our research that the university

33:40.400 --> 33:44.400
or in our monitoring type of work that we do in the FSFE,

33:44.400 --> 33:50.400
to have DMA being forest on a Free Software developer friendly way.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.400
This is good to know.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.400
I'm very happy that there's a goal for us.

33:54.400 --> 34:00.400
So to finalize this, do you think that the DMA can actually help here?

34:00.400 --> 34:03.400
Like that it's protecting Free Software developers?

34:03.400 --> 34:04.400
Yes or no answer?

34:04.400 --> 34:05.400
Yes.

34:05.400 --> 34:06.400
Perfect.

34:06.400 --> 34:07.400
Thank you so much.

34:07.400 --> 34:08.400
I'm very much looking forward to this.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.400
How can the community help now?

34:11.400 --> 34:14.400
Oh, that's perhaps the most important question.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.400
And I'll try to be very concise on this.

34:17.400 --> 34:25.400
I'm very, very grateful for the Android developers from different operating systems that help us to understand all of this.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.400
And they were so nice.

34:27.400 --> 34:34.400
And I will make sure that in our next I love Free Software today to have a very beautiful message to all of them out there.

34:34.400 --> 34:38.400
But how the community can help is with technical advice to us,

34:38.400 --> 34:44.400
you know, spreading the world about this and leveraging our position together.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.400
So we have a coalition.

34:46.400 --> 34:50.400
We have an allies together and say, look, this is important for the whole movement.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.400
Thank you, Lucas.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.400
Thank you so much for being here.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.400
Thank you so much for walking us through this.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.400
And yeah, thank you for taking the time.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.400
The pleasure is always my thank you so much.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.400
This was really interesting.

35:00.400 --> 35:07.400
I'm, yeah, I'm now really much looking forward to the community coming back to us and letting us know what they think as well.

35:07.400 --> 35:11.400
Thank you also for the first live edition of the software freedom podcast.
