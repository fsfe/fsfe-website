    <title>Libre Software Meeting (aka RMLL), Bordeaux, France</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The 2010 Libre Software Meeting is a non commercial conference
        with talks, workshops and round tables about Free Software and
        its uses. The LSM provides a place for exchange and meeting
        between Free Software developers, users and stakeholders. This
        year, it will be at Bordeaux 1 University.

        <strong>Update:</strong> The FSFE will present its activities at
        a booth. We are still looking for helpers at that booth. Whoever
        is interested to join should contact <a
