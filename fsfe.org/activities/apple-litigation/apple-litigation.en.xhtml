  <h1>DMA: Litigation against Apple</h1>

  <div>

    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
      The FSFE is intervening for Free Software in a key court case  
      involving Apple and the European Commission. Apple is trying to 
      avoid obligations derived from the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The 
      FSFE seeks to hold Apple accountable under the DMA in a 
      developer-friendly way.

    <h2>Apple’s unbalanced power is a threat to Free Software</h2>

    <p>Apple is one of the largest tech companies in the world. Its 
    unbalanced power spans key aspects of software and devices, 
    profoundly distorting digital markets. Apple’s dominance negatively 
    affects not only competition with and among other companies, but <a 
    href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">software 
    freedom</a>, open internet and ultimately digital democracy.</p> 

    <p>The <a href="/activities/dma/dma.html">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a> 
    is the European Union’s regulatory 
    response to such corporate power. The law applies to very large 
    companies exercising “gatekeeper control” in the EU. 
    The DMA imposes on such companies several obligations, like allowing 
    the right to install and uninstall software in devices, prohibition 
    of non-removable pre-installed software, enabling third-party app 
    stores and access rights via interoperability with software and 
    hardware functions.</p>

    <p>In September 2023, the European Commission <a 
    href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202344/DMA_100013_215.pdf">designated 
    Apple as a 
    “gatekeeper” under the DMA</a>. With that, the law began to apply to 
    Apple’s operating system, app store and browser. However, <a 
    href="/news/2024/news-20240627-01.html">Apple has 
    taken an aggressive position against the DMA, </a> starting litigation 
    against the European Commission in November 2023.</p>

    <p>Due to the high risks against Software Freedom involved in this 
    case, in February 2024, <strong>the FSFE decided to intervene to hold Apple 
    accountable under the DMA in a developer-friendly way</strong>. <a 
    href="https://husovec.eu/amicus-briefs/">Dr. 
    Martin Husovec</a>, a lawyer with extensive experience in strategic 
    litigation for non-profits, is representing the FSFE before the court.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>“Becoming an intervener in this case is crucial as the FSFE is 
representing the civil society perspective, which enriches the judicial 
proceedings. This allows the court to make fully informed 
decisions”<cite>says Dr. Martin Husovec, the lawyer representing FSFE in 
the 
court</cite>.</blockquote>

    <h2>Safeguarding the interests of Free Software developers and users</h2>

    <p>
    Apple, in this case <a 
    href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/fiche.jsf?id=T%3B1080%3B23%3BRD%3B1%3BP%3B1%3BT2023%2F1080%2FP&amp;nat=or&amp;mat=or&amp;pcs=Oor&amp;jur=T&amp;for=&amp;jge=&amp;dates=&amp;language=en&amp;pro=&amp;etat=pend&amp;cit=none%252CC%252CCJ%252CR%252C2008E%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252Ctrue%252Cfalse%252Cfalse&amp;oqp=&amp;td=%3BALL&amp;avg=&amp;lgrec=en&amp;lg=&amp;cid=4202373">(T-1080/23)</a>, 
    is trying to dodge the DMA rules over its app store and 
    interoperability of its operating system. The company’s narrow 
    interpretation of the DMA frames these obligations as 
    disproportionate in relation to its commercial and economic 
    interests.
    </p> 
    
    <p>
    <strong>The FSFE is countering this position by proving that Apple 
    is being regulated in the light of public interest</strong>. We 
    assert that Apple should compete on trustworthiness. Developers and 
    users should benefit from alternative services and products, not 
    just those offered by Apple. For reasons of fair competition, 
    cybersecurity and consumer protection, we urge that the case be 
    dismissed completely. 
    </p>

    <p>Here is how your rights will be affected by this litigation if the FSFE is successful:</p>

    <div>
      <p><strong><em>As a developer:</em></strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <strong>Access rights:</strong> Software developers will enjoy 
        less restrictive barriers to access and be able to distribute 
        their software in environments controlled by Apple;
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>More software freedom:</strong> Software developers will 
        be able to demand that Apple allow installation of third party 
        apps (side-loading), the use of third party app stores and the 
        uninstallation of pre-installed software in devices;
        </li> 
        <li>
        <strong>Better interoperability policies:</strong> Software 
        developers will be able to demand effective and free-of-charge 
        interoperability between their software and Apple’s software and 
        hardware controlled by Apple’s operating system.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div> 
  
    <div>
      <p><strong>As an user:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <strong>Enhanced freedom of choice:</strong> Users will enjoy 
        more freedom of choice regarding software on Apple devices. 
        Users will benefit from more competition and offers from 
        third-party providers, including alternative app stores, 
        features and solutions.
        </li>
