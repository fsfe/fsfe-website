      <p>
        The local group of the FSFE in Berlin is meeting for the Educational evening. This time not online but in the youth club E-LOK (Laskerstraße 6-8 near Ostkreuz station). This time we are happy that Susanne will present her talk from the Chemnitzer Linux Days about IPv6. The talk is in German and has the title <em>Eine kleine Einführung in IPv6 mit Linux</em> (A short introduction to IPv6 on Linux).
      </p>

        The meeting will start at 19h. Access to the E-LOK is via the right-hand entrance to the courtyard and is barrier-free.
