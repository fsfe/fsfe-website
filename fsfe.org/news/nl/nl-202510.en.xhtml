<h3 id="quote-of-the-month">Quote of the Month</h3>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
‚ÄúI truly believe in the power of saying ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù. Free Software
developers are usually in a loop of bug reports and feature requests by
users. We as users often see what is broken or what is missing, so we
will communicate that to the developers, usually failing to send a
message of how awesome the software is. This is why celebrating I Love
Free Software Day and taking the time to say ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù to the
developers and projects we depend on is important; we need to break the
cycle of negativity that sometimes the developers of Free Software are
stuck in‚Äù<cite> Albert from Barcelona Free Software (see interview
below)</cite>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<h3 id="yearly-report">Software Freedom in Europe 2025</h3>
<p>In 2025 we remained engaged in enforcing the DMA, intervening in the
Apple vs EC legal case; we participated in the debates around the CRA
and public procurement to ensure that Free Software is embedded in
Europe‚Äôs digital future. Also, we continued providing legal support and
improved REUSE, while involving teenagers with YH4F, and we reached new
audiences with the new Ada &amp; Zangemann movies.</p>

<h3 id="dma">The Digital Markets Act turns 1: one year of
pushing for Device Neutrality</h3>
<p>2025 marks one year of the enforcement of the Digital Markets Act. In
our input to the European Commission‚Äôs public consultation we welcome
the DMA as a milestone in regulating large tech corporations, but we
stress the hurdles and challenges for making Device Neutrality a
reality. </p>

<h3 id="litigation">DMA litigation: the FSFE takes part in court
hearing in Apple vs Commission case</h3>
<p>On 21 October, <a href="/news/2025/news-20250922-01.html">the FSFE is participating
as an intervenor in the hearing of the Apple vs. European Commission case
at the Court of Justice of the European Union</a>. As part of the Digital
Markets Act enforcement actions, this is a key case for Free Softwareand digital markets.</p>

<h3 id="legal-corner">Legal Corner: The War on Ad Blockers ‚Äì
Axel Springer‚Äôs Assault on User Freedom</h3>

<p>For many internet users, an adblocker is an important piece of
software that allows them to control the digital information they
receive from their browsers, providing the option of an ad-free browsing
experience. Despite this, <a href="/news/2025/news-20250916-01.html">a 
recent decision by the German Federal Court
of Justice is giving Axel Springer a second chance to erode user
freedom</a>. </p>


<h3 id="ilovefs">ilovefs interview - How
we celebrate "I Love Free Software Day" in Barcelona,
Spain</h3>

<p>Since we began organising events in Europe together with the <a
href="/about/groups.html">FSFE‚Äôs local groups</a>
for <a href="/activities/ilovefs/index.html">"I Love Free
Software Day"</a>, Barcelona has regularly been taking part. The
Barcelona based local group is a mix of people contributing and
developing <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a> and of Free Software friends
from Catalonia. Known as "Barcelona Free Software", they do very great
and amazing events. Over time it was inspiring to see how the events
evolved, from <a
href="/activities/ilovefs/report/report_2023.html">company
related gatherings</a> to <a
href="/activities/ilovefs/report/report_2024.html">independent
group meetings</a> with the opportunity to welcome new Free Software
enthusiasts.</p>

<h3 id="sfp">SFP#38: Policy and EU: Free Software
Software Stack(s)</h3>
<p>During the debate on digital sovereignty, the term ‚Äúsoftware stack‚Äù
started to float around. This term quickly started to fill up with
different ideas, and a discussion about it took root. <a 
href="/news/podcast/episode-38.html">Follow Alex and
Bonnie in this episode to learn more about software stacks of Free Software 
and their connection with public administration</a>. </p>

<h3 id="community">From the community: The FSF elects a new president</h3>
<p>
Our sister organization, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) has elected 
a new president.  Ian Kelling, senior systems administrator for the 
organization and the first union member to hold a seat on its board, <a 
href="https://www.fsf.org/news/2025-ian-kelling-becomes-board-president">has 
been elected as the new president of the FSF</a>.<br/><br/>We 
congratulate Ian for being unanimously elected as the FSF's new 
president and look forward to his work advancing software freedom and 
strengthening our community.
</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="conferences">At the stages: Linux install parties, SFSCON and more</h3>
<p>Last weekend, we attended the 2025 Festa do Software Livre in Porto
while co-organising the second Fediverse Day in Berlin. After that, we
are preparing to attend SFSCON once again; our volunteers are busy
organising various events. For example, in Zurich, our local group is
organising several Linux installation workshops and a 'Free Your
Android' workshop. </p>

<p>In addition, the recording of <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/ebC27wvcuADSo7hM41dDjb">the talk at 
Datenspuren 2025, 'CRA:
Cybersicherheit in der Gesellschaft'</a>, is already online!
