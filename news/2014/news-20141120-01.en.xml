    <title>[Blog] FSFE comments at European Parliament's DG ITEC conference </title>
	<body>
<p>
At a meeting in the European Parliament, FSFE's president Karsten
Gerloff highlighted several ways in which the Parliament could become
more transparent, and make better use of Free Software and Open
Standards.
</p>

<p>
In a short intervention, he urged the Parliament to finally make its
live streams accessible to Free Software users. He asked the
Parliament's IT administration to enable IMAP access on its mail
servers to allow Free Software users to connect through standard
protocols, and warned the Parliament to avoid lock-in as it progresses
towards greater digitisation.
