      I have always been fascinated by free software. I'm supporting free
      software projects in my spare time. My education as well as my work would
      not be possible without free software. The fellow group in Berlin showed
      me how to contribute to free software in a non-technical way. It was and
      still is great fun to work with them in a cogenial atmosphere.  As I'm
      involed in the group now, I think it is time to join the FSFE officially
      and to support them financially.
