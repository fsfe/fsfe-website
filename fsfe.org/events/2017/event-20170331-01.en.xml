		<title>Wiki Caretakers Meeting in Essen, Germany</title> 
 
		<body> 
			<p>The Wiki is an important tool for FSFE staff and activists to share knowledge, to document activities, and provide information about local groups. It is important that its use is casual and inviting and that information there is well structured, so it can be easily found and expanded. This requires continuous maintenance, of the content and workflow design. This meeting shall provide a foundation for this maintenance activity. It will kick off the annual Wiki Sprint.</p>
