= Implementing a country page =

Implementing a country page won't take you long. England and Germany
country pages are a good example of what and how you can achieve easily.
You could start by copying one of these pages, and change the countrycode
variable to your country code:

  <xsl:variable name="country-code">xx</xsl:variable>


== Using the country-people-list template ==

- copy the call to the country-people-list template from your favorite
  country page
- add the 'xx' tag to corresponding people in /about/people/people.en.xml
  e.g. <person id="mueller" member="yes" teams="main, de">


== Fetch news, events ==

- to display news or events for your country, see "Using Tagging Â» Using the 
  fetch-news/fetch-events template" in tools/xsltsl/tagging-documentation.txt
