		  <p>You found your way here, because - like us - you care about Free Software and digital civil rights. We need your help to spread the word about the advantages of Free Software, and to explain others why they should care about Freedom, too. Advocating for Free Software is fun and arguably one of the best ways to help the Free Software movement! On this page you find a lot of support that helps you: graphics to use, leaflets to print and promotion material to order.</p>

Feel free to copy, spread and use them as long as you keep clear that - whatever you use it for - is not an official product or the official opinion of the FSFE. Thank you very much for promoting Freedom!</p>

Its name is 'Plussy' and the symbol illustrates a human who stands strong for his freedom. At the same time, the human figure opens his arms to include everyone who shares common goals. Finally, the symbol draws a 'plus', because our movement gets stronger with every single identity. Hence, every one who is joining the Fellowship is a plus in the fight for freedom. That is why it is called 'Plussy'.</p>

		      <p>Graphics are good to attract attention, but sometimes it is better to offer printed material with specific and more detailed information. Volunteers from the FSFE have put a lot of work in writing <a href="/about/printable/">information material that you can print out at home</a>. You find political leaflets about:  <!-- (BTW: The page with the leaflets should be improved, too (eg with a content box) --></p>
