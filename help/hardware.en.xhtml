    <h2>Hardware Donations</h2>

    <p>The Free Software Foundation Europe would like to thank all donors of
        equipment for their support -- hardware is an essential
        necessity for our work.</p> 

    <p>We would in particular like to thank</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Hewlett-Packard Germany</b> <br />

            For the donation of two Compaq N2400 servers 
            (Dual CPU, Pentium III 1GHz with 1GB RAM each)
            on 2005-01-17. The machines have replaced our 
            quite outdated web- and mailserver machines and
            are running core services of the Free Software
            Foundation Europe.</li>


    </ul>

    <h3>What we need</h3>

    <p>While you can always support our activities
       <a href="/help/donate.html">financially</a> and by <a href="/help/help.html">getting
       active</a> yourself, we also have need
       for specific hardware for our activities.</p>

    <p>In particular, we are currently looking for</p>

    <ul>

        <li>fiber channel storage capacities for shared disks among
            the servers.</li>

        <li>backup hardware, more specifically tape autochanger
            hardware, preferrably DLT.</li> 

    </ul>

    <p>If you have other hardware that you consider donating and would
       like to know whether we have use for it, please contact <a
            href="mailto:office@fsfeurope.org">office@fsfeurope.org</a>.</p>
