      <h1>TUX&amp;GNU@school - 3rd edition</h1>

      <p><i>Every month the column <a
      href="/activities/tgs/tgs.html">TUX&amp;GNU@school
      [2]</a> reports about free education software, a homepage on
      the topic and an easy to implement idea. This month I talk
      about <a href="http://edu.kde.org/kgeo">KGeo</a>, a free
      geometry programm for KDE, about <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch">edux.ch</a>, the info portal for
      Swiss schools and GNU/Linux and about the idea "Textfilter -
      filters once for a good thing".</i></p>

      <p>Welcome to the third and last edition of
      TUX&amp;GNU@school, the "last" only in the sense of the first
      triple serie ending with this edition. Now it's definitive: I
      will release the column furthermore monthly. With the next
      edition there are some news but more about this in the next
      month. But now to the first item.</p>

      <h3>KGeo - Geometry with the mouse</h3>

      <p>KGeo <a href="http://edu.kde.org/kgeo">[3]</a> <a
      href="http://kgeo.sourceforge.net">[4]</a> is a free geometry
      education program which which recently became part of the <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org">KDE-Edutainment project [5]</a>.
      It's developed by Marc Bratsch and available in German and
      English at the moment. I tested the Version 1.0.2 under
      Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 and KDE 2.2.2.</p>

      <p>After the first start you right catch sight of the main
      window of KGeo in which the single function panels are
      disposed at the sides. The construction board with an
      underlying coordinate system is in the middle. Generally the
      interfaces isn't overloaded with functions and with it
      clearly. Besides the menu the program has another five
      function panels until now that each user can arrange him- or
      herself. Thereby three panels are thought for the
      construction of geometric objects, another one contains
      functions for measuring and calculating of lengths, areas,
      etc. and the last panel invokes general ways you need for
      erasing or moving of objects.</p>

      <p>When the user works with KGeo, he is always in one of
      three modes. These are the construction mode, the drag mode
      and trace mode. It is possible, in the construction mode, to
      draw geometric objects like points, routes or triangles
      farther there are methods for vectors, centres, parallels or
      angles too. With combination of these objects and methods you
      then even can construct reflections, translations or
      rotations. If you want to size the drawn figures the
      developer made tools to measure the circle areas, distances,
      angles, slopes or circumfences. All construction buttons have
      an information window that appears if the mouse pointer is
      over the button. These windows and the short sentence in the
      status panel explain the function as good that you don't have
      to work in and you can begin your work in a moment.</p>

      <p><img src="./img/kgeo.en.png"

      </p>

      <h5>Screenshot 1: KGeo and the theorem of Thales</h5>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p>In the drag mode you can move the single objects in the
      coordinate system, dependences like reflection or a rotations
      with certain angle stay maintained respectively are ongoing
      tracked. By enabling the trace mode too which is possible for
      each point separately, you can even track the exact move or
      points. Then if you're happy with your drawing and you want
      not only save it but also showing the result to your teacher
      the next day, the best way to do this is to print it. Of
      course this can KGeo too.</p>

      <p>But for all that there is of course a German and English
      manual for the ongoing geometry masteress. That is quite
      short and bare but even so good and easy to understand. I
      personally like especially the chapter "Using KGeo" which
      explains constructions for the encouragement at schools but
      "only" the theorem of the Thales circle up to now. But I'm
      sure some of the TUX&amp;GNU@school readers could change this
      ?!? If in any case we talk about KGeo at school I want to
      talk about the possibility switching KGeo into the Kioskmode.
      In this mode the coordinate system with the drawing is
      displayed on the whole screen but you can't change anything
      then. But at the end of the report I have to give you some
      bad news. It seems as if KGeo isn't developed anymore at
      least at the moment. Nevertheless a large "thank you" to Marc
      for the program, I like it and surely not only me.</p>

      <p>But now continues to the home of the "ALIS - Arbeitsgruppe
      Linux an Schulen" (Swiss work group for linux at school).</p>

      <h3>edux.ch - the info portal for Swiss schools and
      GNU/Linux</h3>

      <p>At least, a <a href="http://www.edux.ch">project [6]</a>
      which I am actively working in, and, besides that, the
      project out of which the TUX&amp;GNU@school originated. The
      "ALIS - Arbeitsgruppe Linux an Schulen" (Swiss work group for
      linux at school), the group behind edux.ch, originated out of
      the <a href="http://www.lugs.ch">LUGS - Linux User Group
      Switzerland [7]</a> in november 2001. The three people
      Christoph Kuhn, Daniel Dahinden and Mario Fux founded the
      task force all people employing with Free Software and
      GNU/Linux at schools already beforehand. We want to create an
      information plattform for all the Swiss (and other) schools
      interesting on the topic.</p>

      <p>When you enter the URL <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch">http://www.edux.ch</a> in the
      favorite browser, first you'll see a welcome page. Following
      the shown link you'll come to the front page of the Swiss
      information portal. This is divided in three columns as you
      can see in screenshot 2. Leftmost there is the navigation
      panel which is on all the other sides too, beneath it an
      input window for the username and the password is situated
      where interested and already registered people can log in. At
      the right side there are some links to chummy groups and
      projects like the already known <a
      href="http://www.pingos.schulnetz.org">PingoS [8]</a> or <a
      href="http://www.wilhelmtux.ch">WilhelmTUX [9]</a>. As you
      can see at the navigation panel the website ist subdivided in
      seven sections up to now. Thereby the first is the front page
      itself whereas all the rest have subsections unless <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch/nav.php?site=26">"Kontakt" (contact)
      [10]</a>.</p>

      <p><img src="./img/edux.en.png"
      alt="Screenshot 2: Front page of edux.ch" width="800"
      height="600" border="0" /><br />
      Screenshot 2: Front page of edux.ch</p>

      <p>In the first purview <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch/nav.php?site=29">"Alles über ALIS"
      (everything about ALIS) [11]</a> the interested reader can
      get to know more about the task force e.g. how the group is
      compound and how it is originated. By now the third <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch/nav.php?site=81">link [12]</a>
      should show you something well known viz the current and all
      past editions of TUX&amp;GNU@school. Probably in the near
      future there you can find more about the "easy to implement
      ideas" mainly about the already implemented ones. In the
      section <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch/nav.php?site=47">"Education
      Software" [13]</a> you can find information about <a
      href="http://www.lernnetz-sh.de/kmlinux">kmLinux [14]</a> and
      you can order it in Switzerland. More about kmLinux perhaps
      more in one of the next editions. You can find there a <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch/nav.php?site=68">"Linksammlung"
      (link collection) [15]</a> about free education software and
      conditional sites.</p>

      <p>Then the fifth reference guides to a central section of
      edux.ch, the <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch/forum/index.php?f=0">Forum [16]</a>.
      So far three active forums and a test-forum are arranged. You
      can discuss and criticise about themes in the context of Free
      Software at schools in the forums "Linux im Bildungsbereich"
      (Linux at school), "Fragen zu Linux-Software" (questions
      about linux software) and "Anregungen und Kritik an ALIS"
      (suggestions and criticism about ALIS). The first two forums
      can be subscribed optionally as mailing lists too.</p>

      <p>You find <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch/nav.php?site=64">brochures [17]</a>
      in the second last section. There will be more in the future
      but until now you'll find a linux guide called "SuSE Linux
      verwenden - Ein Leitfaden für Windows- und
      Macintosh-BenutzerInnen" (Using SuSE Linux - a guide für
      users of Windows and MacOS), a selection of German
      OpenOffice.org and StarOffice courses for downloading as pdf
      or text files and a German and French documentation about the
      free 2D-CAD software <a href="http://www.qcad.org">QCad
      [18]</a>. How and where you can find us is written on the
      last page under <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch/nav.php?site=26">"Kontakt" (contact)
      [10]</a>.</p>

      <p>What we're still missing is more (wo)manpower. We have
      many ideas and a lot to do and need additional helpers for
      that. If somebody is interested he or she can send us an
      email to <a href="mailto:alis@lugs.ch">[19]</a>. As a little
      stimulus I still want to mention two projects we're working
      on: On the one hand this is the email survey on education
      software publishers concerning available education software
      for GNU/Linux and on the other hand we test education
      software for Windows and Macintosh under <a
      href="http://www.winehq.com">WINE [20]</a> and <a
      href="http://www.transgaming.com">WineX [21]</a> and then we
      write little HOWTOs.</p>

      <p>Oh yes before I'll forget it. For all the people who
      doesn't know it, Switzerland has got four national languages
      and so you always have to accost all speech groups. We want
      this too and as a first step we'll publish our whole website
      besides in German in French too. Interesting translators for
      Italian and Rätoromanic are supposed to send an email to <a
      href="mailto:alis@lugs.ch">[19]</a>.</p>

      <h3>"Textfilter - filters once for a good thing"</h3>

      <p>Before I'll come to the idea of this month I can talk this
      time too about an implementation of idea of the last month.
      For remembrance: The idea of the last time was to format
      text, to use small and large letters and to erase punctuation
      marks. Already one week after publishing <a
      href="/activities/tgs/tagatschool2.html">TUX&amp;GNU@school
      2 [22]</a> Roland Spielhofer told me that he implemented the
      idea in PHP and that it is now available unter <a
      href="http://zbp.boku.ac.at/schule/">[23]</a>. After a query
      about the source code he told me among others that the
      conversion took "only" half an hour. This is a good example
      for what I want to accomplish with this section. A problem
      that tooks a lot of time for a teacher or a pupil can be
      implemented by a talented programmer in only a few minutes
      and so saving time for a lot of people. Nevertheless or right
      therefore the work of the programmer should be appreciated.
      Also a "thank you" to Roland in Vienna, Austria for this
      time.</p>

      <p><img src="./img/text4mator.en.png"
      alt="Screenshot 3: Text4mator from Vienna" width="800"
      height="600" border="0" /><br />
      </p>

      <h5>Screenshot 3: Text4mator form Vienna</h5>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p>But now to the idea of this month. Who doesn't know the
      separation excercises we all made at school. Well already
      various worksheets were made for this theme and will made
      again. Thereby and by related jobs the elaborating teachers
      have alwasy to make lists with complying words. For the
      hacker next door it would be easy to write a program or
      script which searches words out of a text, given or searched
      in the internet, and packetises in a list. Perhaps even
      making a worksheet yet ?!? I concede this month's idea isn't
      far thought respectively worked out. But let you flow your
      neurons and surprise the readers of the next edition with
      further going and maybe crazy ideas.</p>

      <p>At the end I still want to ask for reports for a new
      section in this column. At the next or the next but one time
      I want initiate a new section beneath the existing three
      reporting about already realised projects at schools and
      migration to free software and/or GNU/Linux. If you don't
      want to write your own report you can answer to the questions
      next released under <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch/nav.php?site=81">[12]</a> and send
      the text to <a href="mailto:foxman@lugo.ch">me</a>.</p>

      <p>That's it for this month. Up to the next time when there
      are a lot of news ;-).</p>

      <h4>About the author:</h4>

      <p>Mario Fux finished 1999 the PrimarlehrerInnenseminar in
      Brig after he made up mathematical and natural scientifical
      matura. In a body with two colleagues he founded the <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch">"ALIS - Arbeitsgruppe Linux an
      Schulen"</a> (Swiss work group for linux at school).
      Meanwhile he studies at the <a
      href="http://www.ethz.ch">Swiss Federal Institut of
      Technology Zurich</a> <a
      href="http://www.ee.ethz.ch">informations technology and
      electrical engineering</a>. And if he once doesn't spend his
      time in front of the PC, he sits at his nature pond in the <a
