        <title>Workshop at NGI Forum - Simplifying licensing and copyright information for the Next Generation Internet  in Brussels, Belgium</title>

    <body>
      <p>The NGI Forum is the flagship event of the European Commissionâ€™s Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative. Tobias Diekershoff and Lucas Lasota will represent the FSFE with a workshop on REUSE. The event will happen in Brussels.</p>
      <p>Free Software is at the heart of the Next Generation Internet initiative.  However, the multiple competing licensing requirements for communicating the chosen license of a software project and its copyright holders increase the compliance burden on project maintainers. REUSE aims to remediate this situation, providing NGI projects with a set of easy-to-implement best practices for declaring copyright and licensing in an unambiguous, human- and machine-readable way. In this workshop, you will learn the basics of Free Software licensing and how to implement REUSE in your software project.</p>
      <p>The event is free but places are limited. Online streaming and participation will be also provided. English will the working language.</p>
