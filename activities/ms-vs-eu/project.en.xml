    <title>Microsoft versus European Union citizens</title>
    <description>
     In 2001 the European Union, through the DG Competition of the
     European Commission (lead by Mr. Mario Monti), started investigating
     Microsoft's dominant position in the market for desktop operating systems.
     The Free Software Foundation Europe was invited by the
     European Commission to represent the interests of the Free Software movement. Since 2004,
     FSFE is participating in the appeal to again defend
     competition and freedom of choice against abuses.
