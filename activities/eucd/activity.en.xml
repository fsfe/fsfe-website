    <title>EUCD - Copyright extensions that harm</title>
    <description>
      The European Copyright Directive (EUCD) was the European
      equivalent of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
      These laws not only lead to the creation of monopolies and
      cartels, they also provide serious impediments to the Freedoms of
      speech and press, as they provide means for digital censorship.
      The FSFE was actively involved in the resistance against
      such harmful legislation.
