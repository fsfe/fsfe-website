<p>What would you think about a sign on the highway saying “You need a
Toyota to drive on this road. Contact your Toyota dealer for a gratis
test drive -- Your Government”? When it comes to software that opens PDF
files, many public sector organisations do this every day.</p>

</div>

<p>With the pdfreaders.org campaign we have turned the spotlight on
government organisations who behave in this way, exposing how frequent such
advertisements for non-free software are. With the help of activists across
Europe, <a href="/activities/pdfreaders/follow-up.html">we contacted</a> these
organisations and explained to them how to improve their websites so that
they respect our freedom.</p>

<h2>Why should we care?</h2>

  <p>Even when a certain software is given away for free, the company behind it
  can have an economic gain: promoting that software means prioritising a
  specific company. Public bodies should not promote any specific private
  company, instead they should promote equality and choice on the software
  market. That is why FSFE and its volunteers intervened to fix the
  problem.</p>
    
  <p>This campaign was based on three core principles we support at FSFE:</p>

	<ul>
	  
    <li>Neutrality - Public institutions should not engage in advertising</li>

    <li>Freedom - Public institutions should not ask citizens to use non-free
      Software</li>

    <li><a href="/freesoftware/standards/def.html">Open Standards</a> – The versions of
      the PDF format which are Open Standards can be implemented by all PDF
      readers</li>

  </ul>
    
  <h2>What did we achieve?</h2>

  <div class="captioned left">

	  </footer>
  </div>

  <p>Every day, public institutions advertise non-free software on their
  websites. With the help of our Fellows and of hundreds other Free Software
    activists, we collected <a
      href="/activities/pdfreaders/buglist.html">2104 bug
      reports</a> over the course of one month from every country in Europe,
    and also nine countries outside of Europe. </p>
  
  <p>Next, the FSFE and its volunteers sent letters to all the public
  administrations on our list asking them to either remove their advertising
  for proprietary software, or to at least run equal advertising for Free
  Software, so that users of their websites realise that they have a choice. In
  response, we received a lot of positive feedback from the institutions
  thanking us for our letters.</p>
    
  <p>Now, several years, and thousands of letters later, the FSFE has closed
  the campaign. Thanks to all the dedicated Free Software activists who helped
  contact institutions, we can proudly announce that we were able to remove
  advertisements for proprietary PDF readers in 1125 of the 2104 public
  administration websites (53%).</p>

  <p>Furthermore, we were able to push for a change at both national and
  international levels.</p>
    
  <ul>

    <li> In Germany, <a
        href="http://gruen-digital.de/2012/03/document-freedom-day-kleine-anfrage-zur-werbung-fuer-adobe-reader-eingereicht/">national
        parties</a> gave statements in favour of free PDF readers and the
        German Government itself has recommended the usage of our text snippet
          in their <a
        href="http://www.cio.bund.de/Web/DE/Architekturen-und-Standards/Migrationsleitfaden-und-Migrationshilfen/migrationsleitfaden_node.html">migration
        guide</a>. FSFE's coordinator for Germany, Max Mehl, <a href="http://blog.mehl.mx/2015/german-government-wants-authorities-to-advertise-pdfreaders/">covers it</a> 
        in more detail on his blog.</li>

    <li>In the EU: the European Parliament <a
        href="/activities/pdfreaders/parliamentary-questions-eu.html">directly
        asked</a> the European Commission what were the reasons for advertising
    a specific software and which steps were taken to solve this problem.</li>

    <li> In 2011 one of our pdfreaders.org coordinators, <a
        href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/polina/2015/09/10/free-pdf-reader-for-the-web-browser/">
        Hannes Hauswedell, was in contact with Google</a>, asking them to
      release the PDF reader included in their Chrome browser as Free Software.
      Finally, in May 2014 the <a
        href="https://twitter.com/nasko/status/469595752734269440"> pdfium
        sources were published openly</a>, and while FSFE's enquiry might not
      have been the only reasons they were released, it marks an important
      change for the widespread adoption of Free Software PDF readers.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>In addition to contacting public institutions to resolve the issue, FSFE
  also collected signatures from 90 organisations, 63 businesses, and 2731
  individuals who demanded equal access for Free Software PDF readers. This
  wide-ranging support also demonstrated the popularity of the campaign
  overall.</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

  <p>The Free Software movement is, above all, supported by its community; we
  always need your help to continue to help promote free PDFreaders, and
  together we can make a difference for the future of Free Software! We
  encourage you to continue to <a href="/activities/pdfreaders/letter.html">use
    our template and send letters</a> or emails to public bodies that are still
  advertising for proprietary software and closed standards. We also have a
  link for tips on <a href="/activities/pdfreaders/follow-up.html">how to
    follow-up with the relevant institution</a>. This is a great (and easy)
  activity for a local Free Software groups to spread Free Software knowledge
  in the public administration.</p>
