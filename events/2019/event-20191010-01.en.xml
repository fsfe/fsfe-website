    <title>The FSFE Local Group meeting on Next Generation Internet in Berlin, Deutschland</title>

    <body>
      <p>The FSFE's Project Manager Gabriel Ku Wei Bin will give a talk about the "Next Generation Internet" Initiative",
that the FSFE is currently involved in. In short, the project, which is funded by the European Commission, gives grant funding opportunities to people developing software, that can help transform the internet into a platform, that respects human and societal values, privacy, participation, and diversity. Gabriel will talk about FSFE's role in all this and how interested people can apply to get financial and technical support from this Initiative.</p>
      <p>The meeting will start at 19h, but the talk will start at about 20h at E-LOK (Laskerstra√üe 4-6, near train station Ostkreuz). If you would like to follow the Berlin Local Group activities, you can do so on the <a href="https://libranet.de/profile/fsfeberlin">Friendica platform</a>.</p>
