    <h1>10 reasons for schools to use Free Software</h1>

    <p class="background">
      The Freedom Task Force (FTF) helps individuals, projects and businesses
      understand Free Software licensing and the opportunities that it
      presents.  Our responsibilities are education, training, consultancy,
      fiduciary services and licence enforcement.  The FTF coordinates FSFE's
      legal activities and manages the Foundation's interaction with issues
      like the European Commission versus Microsoft anti-trust case.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>

    <p>Using Free Software allows schools to teach children to share and cooperate 
and thus join a whole community that shares knowledge
    </p>

    <h2>Education at home</h2>

    <p>
     With free software, teachers can give a copy to each student. Thus children 
of families with less financial resources can learn with the same tools as every 
other child
    </p> 

    <h2>Learning to program</h2>

    <p>
      The possibility to tinker motivates children to learn more. Free sfotware 
allows to go to any depth
    </p>

    <h2>Learning to use software</h2>

    <p>
     Free Software permits students to learn how software works and thus to adapt
to any environment, a key skill nowadays
    </p>

    <h2>Learning in native language</h2>

    <p>Free Software applications are being translated into almost any language. 
Thus each child can learn and focus on the actual subject without any language or 
cultural barriers
    </p>

    <h2>Independence</h2>

    <p>Teaching a child to rely on proprietary software makes him dependent on 
something s/he'll have to pay for. Teaching him/her to rely on Free Software, the 
child can continue using this software n his/her adult life while helping others 
by sharing it.Using and teaching Free Software also makes the school itself 
independent from any commercial interests.
    </p>

    <h2>Slash your hardware costs</h2>

    <p>
     Free Software can be used with minimal hardware requirements on almost any 
hardware. Thus, it saves money again
    </p>

  <h2>Forget your licenses costs</h2>

    <p>
     Without licence fees, the school saves money and can use it to train the 
teachers or for technical support to disburden the teachers
    </p>

  <h2>Don't worry about your licenses</h2>

    <p>
    With Free Software, there are no worries about expiry dates or costs of the 
licenses. Free Software stays free in every sense. There is no risk to mislead 
any child to use an illegal copy
    </p>

    <h2>Administer easily</h2>

<p>Free Software is stable, secure and reliable. Security and other updates can 
be implemented in a minute. Its maintenance is automated and thus time-saving.</p>
