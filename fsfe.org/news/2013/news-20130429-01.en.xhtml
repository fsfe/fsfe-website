		<h1>Illegal procurement favouring Microsoft killed in Portuguese court</h1>
		
		<p>On April 27, the administrative court of Almada, Portugal, declared a 550, 000 Euro contract between Microsoft and the municipality of Almada <a href="/news/2013/court-act-portugal.pdf">to be illegal</a>. The technical specifications of the competition launched by the municipality prevented any company other than Microsoft and their partners to submit a proposal.</p>

		<p>This ruling is especially significant as it clarifies that a widely used procurement procedure is illegal. The procedure specified the name of Microsoft products instead of their general functional and technical requirements.</p>

		<p>Unfair tendering practices in Portugal have been repeatedly denounced by FSFE's Associate Organisation <a href="https://ansol.org/">ANSOL</a> and the  <a href="http://www.esop.pt/">Portuguese Open Source Business Association ESOP</a>, who brought the case to court. They violate fundamental rules of fair competition and systematically exclude companies that provide services based on Free Software.</p>

		<p>FSFE welcome the court's decision, and calls on other European national courts to continue to systematically annul similarly discriminatory contracts.</p>
