      <p>As part of the “Dialog für Cybersicherheit”, the FSFE and the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) are working together with representatives from civil society, academia, industry and public authorities in a project on the CRA and its implication for Free Software. In order to create clarity, information is needed on who will take on which role and which tasks and processes are to be carried out. In particular, the role of Open Source Stewards and Free Software outside the commercial interest are of particular importance to the project. </p>
     <p>As part of the project, we invite experts to give talks and share their expertise to shed light on those questions. On Thursday a presentation by Maarten Aertsen (NLnet Labs) will take place, focusing on how Free Source Software is addressed by the Cyber Resilience Act and in particular on how that is different from other New Legislative Framework (NLF) style regulations in different segments. Afterwards there will be time for a discussion.</p>
