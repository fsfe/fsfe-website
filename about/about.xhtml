        <h1>About the Free Software Foundation Europe</h1>

   <p>The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSF Europe) is a charitable
   non-governmental organization dedicated to all aspects of Free
   Software in Europe. Access to software determines who may
   participate in a digital society. Therefore the freedoms to use,
   copy, modify and redistribute software - as described in the Free
   Software definition - allow equal participation in the information
   age. </p><p>Creating awareness for these issues, securing Free
   Software politically and legally, and giving people freedom by
   supporting development of Free Software are central issues of the
   FSF Europe, which was founded in 2001 as the European sister
   organization of the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/fsf/fsf.html">Free
   Software Foundation North America</a>.</p>
