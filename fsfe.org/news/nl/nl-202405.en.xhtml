<h1>LLW 2024 +++ YH4F interviews +++ Ada in France</h1>

<p>
May comes with legal news such as the Legal &amp; Licensing Workshop and 
the Bitcoin lawsuit regarding the liability of Free Software developers. 
We also talked to two 2023 YH4F participants and our Danish local group 
sent an Open Letter to their parliament. Did you see that Ada &amp; 
Zangemann won a prize and that the French ebook version is now 
available?

<h3 id="llw2024">LLW 2024: A forum for difficult legal topics of Free Software in Gothenburg</h3>
<p>
For the second year in a row, the Swedish city of Gothenburg hosted an 
edition of the Free Software Legal &amp; Licensing Workshop (LLW), the 
annual conference for the Legal Network members. <a href="/news/2024/news-20240506-01.html">The 2024 edition brought new 
faces and great discussions </a> and presentations on current legal and 
licensing issues related to technological developments such as AI. 
</p>

<h3 id="yh4f-participants">Meet Antoni and Tobias, YH4F participants</h3>
<p>
Find out more about the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom participants of the 2023 
edition. We are continuing this series <a href="/news/2024/news-20240430-01.html">talking with Antoni and 
Tobias</a>: Antoni developed a dictionary to preserve endangered 
languages, and Tobias conceived a rich featured calendar.
</p>

<h3 id="free-software-liabiliby">Free Software developers' liability and the Bitcoin lawsuit</h3>
<p>
Free Software is everywhere, with studies estimating that it is present 
in about 96% of the applications that we use. But what are the 
responsibilities and liabilities of the Free Software developers? A 
potential threat to Free Software developers looms in the form of an 
ongoing lawsuit in the UK involving Bitcoin and its core developers.

<h3 id="ada&amp;zangemann">Ada &amp; Zangemann: news from France</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/activities/ada-zangemann/index.html">‘Ada &amp; Zangemann: A 
Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream’</a> has been 
awarded the 2024 Youth Book Prize of the InCyber Forum Europe. This is 
the first time this prize has been awarded to a 
children's book.
</li>
<li>
300 copies of Ada &amp; Zangemann were distributed to teachers at the  
Journée du Libre Éducatif 2024. The book was presented at this fair, 
that this year was held in Paris, by two of the students who 
translated it.
</li>
<li>
More great  news! The French publisher CFE editions published an online 
version of "Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and 
Raspberry Ice Cream": <a href="https://ada-lelivre.fr/">https://ada-lelivre.fr/</a>.

<h3 id="danish-initiative">Danish local group initiative</h3>
<p>
The FSFE Danish local group has sent an Open Letter to the IT spokespersons 
of all the political parties in the Danish Parliament, entitled 
“Digitalisation problems can be solved with Free/Open Source Software”. 
In this letter, the local group pointed out several examples of cases 
in which using proprietary software is harming citizens’ rights and 
privacy, for example the municipalities' strong wish to use proprietary 
software (Google Classroom) in schools, which is actively sharing 
students' private data to Google in violation of the GDPR.
</p>

<p>
The local group is currently waiting for an official answer from the 
parliamentarians though they have already received positive responses.
</p> 
<p>

<h3 id="germany-broadcasters">Germany: Public TV broadcasters announce ‘Streaming OS’ as Free Software</h3>
<p>
The German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF have announced that they will 
integrate their media centres in future and publish their code as Free 
Software. Under the name ‘Streaming OS’, the software will be available 
to the general public under a Free Software licence.
</p>

<p>
In their announcement, the directors of the broadcasters emphasise that 
by publishing the code, they want to give something back to society that 
it has previously paid for. ARD and ZDF are thus addressing the core 
idea of our FSFE initiative <a href="https://publiccode.eu/en/">‘Public 
Money? Public Code!’</a>. We are looking forward to seeing Streaming OS 
and its code in 2025!
</p>

Umweltsfestival (Environmental Festival) together with Bits&amp;Bäume 
Berlin and KDE Eco. Our volunteers explained to festival attendees the 
sustainable use of computers with Free Software as well as other FSFE 
initiatives such as Public Money, Public Code and 
even answered questions about the Fediverse.

Free Software. And everyone who has done it has found it a really
