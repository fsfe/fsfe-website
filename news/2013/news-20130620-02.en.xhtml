    <h1>As Microsoft repeal some Xbox restrictions, more apply to other products</h1>

    <p newsteaser="yes">Faced with user protests, Microsoft has been forced to
    make the terms for its latest Xbox gaming console <a
      href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/update">look a little less
      restrictive</a>. However, the “new” terms which had caused
    such outrage were not in fact new at all: they were similar to most other
    proprietary software licences, including those covering other Microsoft
    software products and on-line services.</p>

    <p>Restrictions on selling, sharing and gift-giving appear, for example, in
    the Windows 7 and Office 2013 licences. Similar restrictions will continue
    to apply to the Xbox one in that <a
      href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/update">"downloaded titles cannot be
      shared or resold"</a>. Geographic restrictions can also apply to Office
    2013, along a class action waiver. Gamers who were angered by the invasive,
    inadequate and mandatory 24 hour check-in and Kinect voice/motion sensor
    may be similarly angered by the clause demanding “you must comply with any
    technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in
    certain ways. You may not work around any technical limitations in
    the software” in the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/Documents/UseTerms/Windows_7%20Home%20Basic%20K_English_1b4c2a3e-5533-431c-b57b-b986461b01de.pdf">Windows 7 licence</a>.</p>

    <blockquote><p>“Even after reversing course on some of the more egregious
      Xbox One terms, Microsoft still leaves its users wearing digital
      handcuffs,” says Karsten Gerloff, FSFE's president. “We encourage
      everyone to choose Free Software instead, and break free of these
      restrictions.”</p></blockquote>

     <blockquote><p>“While proprietary licenses restrict your freedom, Free Software
      always guarantees that you can use the software for any purpose, to study
      how it works, to share it with others, and modify it to your needs” says
      Matthias Kirschner, FSFE's Head of Public Awareness. “Users should not
      have to beg for these rights.”</p></blockquote>

	  <p>It is still unclear what exactely the full license will or will not contain, for example, mention of the Class Action Waiver has been removed, but no stament has been made to repeal it.</p></div>
