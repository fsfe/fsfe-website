<h1 class="p-name">Router Freedom</h1>

<div class="e-content">

<div id="introduction">

<p>It should go without saying that in our society we should be able to 
freely choose technical devices for use in our homes like we are free 
to choose what mobile phone we buy. But some Internet service providers 
in Europe dishonor this principle by dictating which device their 
customers have to use in order to connect to the internet, or they 
discriminate against the owners of alternative devices. This 
undermining of our basic freedom of choice is strongly opposed by the 
Free Software Foundation Europe and many other organisations, projects, 
and individuals. Router Freedom is not merely a topic for experts. It 
affects all of us.</p>

</div>


<h2>What are routers and modems?</h2>

<p>Routers and modems are equipment (or terminals, according to 
European regulations) that our devices (like computers, smartphones, 
TV, etc) use to connect with the Internet Service Provider (ISP). While 
the modem brings the information in, the router distributes (or 
“routes”) it to different devices. Routers share information between 
computers, and connect to the internet through a modem. Sometimes a 
router and modem are offered by ISP in a same device. However, a router 
has no access to the internet without a modem. Routers can handle other 
functions too, for instance WiFi, Voice over IP (VoIP), and TV 
streaming, and also technical details such as port forwarding, dynamic 
DNS, or VPN tunneling. Normally, all internet-based communication 
passes through routers.</p>

<p>Most ISPs in Europe offer a recommended router with the contract for 
their clients. In principle that is not bad because then users do not 
need to search for a suitable device themselves. However, if consumers 
are forced to use this device, this practice can make them totally 
dependent and vulnerable to technical and contract changes, which can 
result in unfair treatment by the ISPs.</p>

<h2>Router Freedom and Net Neutrality</h2>

<p>Network neutrality, or net neutrality for short, is the principle 
that ISPs have to treat all internet communications equally, and not 
discriminate or charge differently, for instance based on user, 
content, website, service, type of equipment, or method of 
communication. Router Freedom is a fundamental corollary of this idea. 
In fact,  the freedom of choice of our own equipment is already 
guaranteed on the European regulatory framework. The <a 
href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2015.310.01.0001.01.ENG">EU's 
Open Internet Regulation (Net Neutrality Regulation)</a> grants end 
users right to access and distribute the lawful content and services of 
their choice via their ISP. The basic rule is: internet traffic shall 
be treated without discrimination.</p>

      alt="Four benefits of Router Freedom. #1. Choose your own router. The device given by your internet service provider should not be the only possibility. #2 Secure your internet connection. Routers transmit personal data. Some terminal equipment offers greater privacy than others. Determine for yourself the level of security you want. #3. Upgrade your router. Increase the speed and coverage of your router. Make it compatible with your devices. Configure, improve, and repair your router. Its performance should be up to you. #4. Avoid a router monopoly If you can only use the equipment provided by a single company, your possibilities might be less secure or user-friendly. And you will have no alternative. Get the most out of the innovations in the router market."/>

<p>In order to protect this freedom, the <a 
href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2015.310.01.0001.01.ENG">article 
5(1) of the Net Neutrality Regulation</a> establishes that the 
enforcement of the respective open internet rules is task for the 
National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) of each European country. They 
must check the application of the Regulation’s rules accordingly to the 
technical guidelines of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic 
Communications (BEREC).</p>

<p>However, many ISP across Europe do not comply with the regulation 
yet, imposing their own routers to consumers in a clearly contradiction 
with the Net Neutrality principle. Their argumentation concerns the 
location of the network termination point (NTP), an arbitrary 
definition between the limits of the user’s private and ISP’s network 
equipment. They introduced a debate to determine whether the NTP would 
be located inside the end-user domain, so they can use their own modem 
and router, or the NTP would be part of the domain of the network 
operator, so end-users cannot use their own router with a private 
modem. In this case, the users should use the ISP's router.</p>

<h2>Router Freedom in Europe</h2>

<p>During the years 2013 and 2016, the FSFE and 9 other civil 
organisations conducted a successful <a 
href="/activities/routers/timeline.html">campaign</a> for Router 
Freedom in Germany that resulted in the adoption of a law obliging all 
German ISPs to enable new clients to use alternative modems and routers 
to connect to the internet. The FSFE is still <a 
href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters/Implementation/Germany">monitoring</a> 
the implementation, has sent out testing devices to volunteers for them 
to check whether their ISPs obey the law, and collected the 
results.</p>

<p>However, the awareness for such fundamental topic is still <a 
href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters/#Router_Freedom_in_Europe">very 
low</a> across Europe. Users are not being consciously informed about 
the risks of not having the freedom to choose their own equipment. It 
is unacceptable to limit Router Freedom on the basis of a arbitrary 
definition that only benefits ISPs and subjugates users to a very 
unfair and submissive situation.</p>

<p>The map below tracks the implementation of the Network Termination 
Point (NTP) of all the EU member states. The location of the NTP 
determines the limits of ISP's and users' networks which has a huge 
impact on Router Freedom. This map is constantly updated.</p>

<h2>Why is Router Freedom important?</h2>

<p>Let's put it this way: your whole internet traffic, encryption, 
backups, communication, shopping, writings, business interaction, and 
so on are transferred through your router. If your router is not free, 
your digital freedom is likely to be compromised.</p>

<p>The infringement of the Router Freedom may happen by different 
restrictions, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ISP does not allow the client to use another router, i.e. by 
contract.</li>

<li>The ISP does not give the client the connection data like username 
and password for the PPPoE/VoIP connection (might differ in some 
countries but the problem remains the same).</li>

<li>The ISP uses non-standard techniques to connect its clients to the 
internet/its infrastructure, i.e. special plugs or proprietary 
protocols.</li>

<li>The ISP requires any router to be registered at their own 
infrastructure, i.e. by MAC address or other identification. So the 
client is not able to use her own devices because they won't get an IP 
address or other necessary data.</li>
</ul>

<figure  class="max-width-100 no-border">

      alt="Infographic explaining the importance of Free Software for Router Freedom"/>
</figure>

<p>These situations show the bad consequences of the lack on Router 
Freedom. The reasons to defend and promote Router Freedom concern 
ethical and technical elements to our basic needs to internet access, 
such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Freedom of choice</strong>: We have the right to choose our 
own electronic devices.  If customers do not want to use the 
ISP-recommended device for any reason, the ISP must respect this 
without repercussions for the user.</li>

<li><strong>Privacy and Data Protection</strong>: The lack of Router 
Freedom compromises our privacy and the security of our most sensitive 
personal data.</li>

<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Some ISPs impose to users specific 
models, forcing them to acquire only compatible hardware. From the 
consumer’s and the environment’s point of view this is unfavorable due 
to the build up of electronic waste even though the devices would still 
work.</li>

<li><strong>Free Competition and Technological Progress</strong>: Users 
profit from the free competition that guarantees free choice and steady 
improvement of products. The lack of competition would, eventually, 
come at the cost of the user because (security) features would be 
continually reduced and the user-friendliness would drop. This goes 
even further: If a user is forced to use a router, the ISP is only one 
step apart from supporting only one SIP provider, one cloud storage, 
one DynamicDNS provider, or one media streaming platform. The user 
cannot use their phones, their trusted online storage or their 
hardware, because it is not supported.</li>

<li><strong>Security</strong>: The lack of Router Freedom increases the 
probability that large parts of the router market is dominated by only 
one or a few product families or manufacturers. Then, if major problems 
or security holes appear, an enormous number of users will affected at 
once. Most ISPs only use a few router models and thus endanger the 
security of their customers. That is particularly problematic when 
manufacturers and providers are very slow in the delivery of critical 
updates and users are not allowed to perform updates themselves.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Get active</h2>

<p>ISPs across Europe are imposing their own routers to consumers, 
threatening our freedom of choice towards the equipment we use for 
Internet connection. ISPs are leveraging the debate on the European 
level using questionable definitions about the Network Termination 
Point. You can take part in this fundamental campaign to defend our 
freedom.</p>

<p>We already won in Germany and other countries are following the 
path. We have learned valuable lessons in the process and compiled them 
in a <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters/">wiki 
page</a>, where you can find all necessary information to fight against 
the disruption of Router Freedom, and raise the problem within your 
community and to your political representatives.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.fsfe.org/en/teams/router-freedom-tech-wiki">Router Freedom tech wiki</a> supports the Router Freedom campaign by collecting information on how to use a different modem or router
for your internet provider. Having the ability to choose your own router will give you the possibility of more control over the device that is relaying all your internet traffic.</p>

<p>In order to understand the end-users' experience with their Internet 
Service Provider regarding Router Freedom, we have create this <a 
href="https://survey.fsfe.org/index.php/628449?lang=en">survey</a> that 
will help us follow the status of this right in the European Union. 
Your opinion is very important for us, it will take only few 
minutes!</p>
