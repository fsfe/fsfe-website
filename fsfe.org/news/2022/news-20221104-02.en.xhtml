<h1 id="interview-with-Ekaterina-Miquel-and-Alexia">Let’s talk with young hackers Ekaterina, Miquel and Alexia about YH4F</h1>

 <p>
 The first edition of the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom contest has ended. 
 After 5 months of coding, over 35 young people came up with 
 outstanding projects. Three of them will be introduced to you in this 
 interview. Ekaterina, the mind behind Music Companion, Miquel who 
 developed Smart Table Assistant and Alexia, the creator of a basic 
 password manager. 
 </p>

 <p>
 The <a href="/activities/yh4f/">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</a> contest, 
 is a competition organised by the FSFE that encourages young Europeans 
 to start working on their personal technical project. As there are no 
 limits to the possibilities of projects that could be submitted and 
 every technical idea is welcome, the first edition ended up with a 
 great number of diverse and inspiring projects, making it really hard 
 for the jury members to choose the <a 
 href="/news/2022/news-20221004-01.html">six 
 winners</a>.With all those well done projects we thought about a way 
 how to best highlight the effort and work that was put into them. 
 Hence, we are happy to present three of the contestants.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Ekaterina is 16 years old and currently living in the Republic of 
 Cyprus. She has written her first program for the Youth Hacking 4 
 Freedom competition, Music Companion. Next, we have Miquel, who is from 
 Spain and 17 years old. Miquel has worked on his Smart Table Assistant 
 and had some experience with programming and tinkering before joining 
 the competition. He is studying Industrial Engineering and is 
 passionate about new technologies, entrepreneurship and discovering new 
 things. His goal is to help our society by developing projects in the 
 Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field. Last 
 but not least, we are happy to introduce Alexia, who is living in 
 Bucharest, Romania. Alexia also had some contact with programming 
 before the competition and is enrolled in a technical school.

 <p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: Hello 
 Ekaterina, Miquel and Alexia. Thank you for joining us for this 
 interview.</p>

 
 <p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Before we 
 start learning about your different projects, we would like to know a 
 bit more about your technical background and how you started learning 
 to program.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Alexia</span></strong>: The first 
 programming language I was ever introduced to was C++. It was taught to 
 me in my last year of primary school. I never enjoyed it as much as my 
 classmates, but it enabled me to learn other languages such as Python 
 and SQL which are more applicable in my everyday projects. I was lucky 
 enough to have very passionate and supportive teachers throughout my 
 school years. They taught me all the difficult principles of 
 programming and always referred me to the best materials. I was indeed 
 very fortunate in this regard.</p>
 
 <p>
 <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Ekaterina</span></strong>: My first contact with programming was during my Computer Science GCSE which is when we started learning some basic programming concepts and coding in VisualBasic. Later in my Computer Science A-Level we started learning Python, which was when I started to learn programming by myself using SoloLearn and Stackoverflow.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Miquel</span></strong>: My first contact with programming was when I was about 12 years old with C++ and Arduino. I was already interested before, but I wasn't very good at the subject. I signed up for an introductory course for a few months and then started a self-learning process. I love being able to make what I imagine to come true, and through programming, 3d printing, 3d design and the desire to learn, some things are possible.</p> 

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Miquel, you 
 have worked with hardware and have also submitted a hardware project. 
 What was the first hardware project you worked on? How and why did you 
 start making new devices?
 </p>

 <p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Miquel</span></strong>: Honestly, 
 no one in my family is professionally engaged in any field of 
 technology or programming, but we have always been very interested in 
 it. Since I was little, I have accompanied my brother and my parents 
 on their little projects and our house construction. I like to work 
 and have challenges.
 When I began to get more into the field of programming and robotics, 
 my brain clicked. Since then I have had ups and downs in motivation, 
 but I continue to undertake new projects. </p>
 
<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: How and why 
 did you decide to join YH4F? And what did you like the most about the 
 contest?
 </p>

 <p>
 <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Ekaterina</span></strong>: It felt 
 like a big challenge. When I heard about the competition from my 
 teacher I was very scared to even sign up. I did not have enough 
 knowledge at that time to write something more complex than "if this 
 condition is true, then output this" and so on. But five months seemed 
 enough for me to learn programming and to write a program. As I was 
 expecting, I would rush towards the end to finish the program, and 
 when 1 week before the program was due I received an email from 
 Alexander Sander saying "Don't worry, it's fine if you did not finish 
 it yet. Send it anyway". It calmed me down so much that I actually 
 finished it and submitted a few days earlier. The support was really 
 necessary and I enjoyed it.</p>

 <p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Alexia</span></strong>: I remember 
 seeing a poster with details about the contest just outside the 
 Computer Lab. My teacher encouraged me to participate, so I decided to 
 join it and challenge myself. I decided to make something that would 
 include a GUI since I never get the chance to implement it to the code 
 I usually write.</p>

<p>
I think the best thing about YH4F is that it promotes Free Software 
alternatives to people who haven’t had the chance to realize the 
benefits of such projects. I use Free Software software pretty 
frequently, especially when it comes to operating systems.
</p>

 <p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Miquel</span></strong>: I remember 
 I was online with a friend, I think it was on Twitter, when I found an 
 announcement of a free software contest. I got interested, and I 
 looked at the information about how to participate.
 After a long time, when there were relatively few days left to finish the registration
 period for the contest, my friend reminded me to register. I told my parents and
 finally signed up.</p>

<p>

This contest for me is a real wonder. I think that giving young people 
the opportunity to show others what they have thought, created and 
suffered doing is very nice. I have been very comfortable throughout the 
process, the mentors have been very kind and understood all the effort. 
It is a pleasure to share this experience with others who are interested 
in it.</p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: How did you 
 came up with your project idea? What motivated you to do your project?
 </p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Alexia</span></strong>: I have a 
 lot of close friends who think the Internet is like an endless 
 playground where you’re anonymous and untouchable. Many of them 
 suffered extremely painful consequences as a result of this. Even if 
 we’re talking about stealing passwords or other types of sensitive 
 data left unprotected, this type of negligence often brings the worst 
 with it.</p>
 <p>
 I remember wanting to make a tool with the purpose of raising awareness 
 to the dangers of unprotected data. Or at least try taking an 
 initiative. I thought that I could make an impact in my inner circle 
 and inspire others to come up with similar ideas.
 </p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Ekaterina</span></strong>: Music 
 has been a part of my life for about 10 years, so the idea came up 
 kind of automatically. At first I thought about making it as a game, 
 however later on I realized that some people wouldn't have enough 
 knowledge about music to play it. This is how it became a small 
 "glossary" about music.</p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: And what motivated you to carry out your project?
 </p>
<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Ekaterina</span></strong>: Simply 
 participating in this competition gave me motivation to realize it. I 
 wanted to get to know programming more and try myself. The competition 
 not only gave me knowledge on how to code in python, but also the 
 experience of learning on the go and facing such challenges by myself. 
 Music Companion is not a very complex app but at the same time a very 
 educational one and I am happy that after conducting the knowledge I 
 had about programming it turned out this awesome.</p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: And Miquel, 
 how did you came up with your idea for the “Smart Table Assistant”?
 </p>
<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Miquel</span></strong>: I have 
 always wanted to be able to invent a product that helps society. Just 
 before the registration period for the youth hacking contest my mother 
 suffered immobility. I saw that she had some difficulty doing some 
 tasks and I thought that a smart table would be a great idea to help 
 her. The Smart Table Assistant is intended for those people who are 
 affected by paraplegia. Paraplegia is a disease that immobilizes the 
 legs and trunk, but not the arms. With this smart table, you can get 
 to customize the furniture to help people with certain pathologies. I 
 saw that with the opportunity of the competition I could motivate 
 myself to develop a project of this scale and thus totally improve my 
 knowledge. </p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Ekaterina 
 your project “Music Companion” has also won a prize at the 
 competition. Do you think it is important for people to understand the 
 basic of music?
 </p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Ekaterina</span></strong>: Yes, I 
 think it is. For today I haven't met people who haven't somehow 
 interacted with music or a musical instrument. But the number of 
 students in music schools is slowly decreasing and this worries me a 
 little bit. I believe music, especially classical, should be learnt 
 and understood by people nowadays rather than ignored or considered 
 old-fashioned.</p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Did some of 
 you encounter any problems during the coding period or the building 
 period?
 </p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Miquel</span></strong>: Of course, 
 in a project of this size, it is very easy to encounter obstacles 
 along the way. I think the hardest part was at the beginning. It was 
 difficult for me to start and organize all the ideas to be able to 
 create something unique, innovative and efficient. The whole first 
 period of analysing and acquiring knowledge was cumbersome but 
 motivating. From the moment I started practising, I began to feel that 
 excitement of the beginning of a very long journey. Also, in the 
 programming, I found some obstacles but I got away with it. I also 
 really enjoyed the design but I needed some help with the assembling 
 of the robot.</p>

<p>I had some inspiration for the aesthetics of the product by the Sagrada Familia
which is an emblematic basilica in Barcelona. With this, I was able to direct the
design and thus, know what functionalities to be able to adapt in that aesthetics
so that I could keep all the utilities of the robot thought in the beginning.</p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Ekaterina</span></strong>: Yes, I 
 faced many problems. I think at least 5 times I said to myself "No, I 
 am giving up, I don't know how to program". It was really stressful at 
 first as I was only surfing around Youtube tutorials for about 2 
 months and only then I started programming. Many times the code wasn't 
 running simply because one symbol or space was missing. And worth 
 mentioning is that I was learning on the go as before I have never 
 faced such complex tasks.</p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Alexia</span></strong>: I 
 definitely encountered a lot of technical issues, and it really didn’t 
 help that it was my first “major” project. I’ve never worked with 
 interfaces before, so this was especially hard. I had no idea how to 
 properly make the design, so pretty much all the effort was put into 
 that. Thinking about it, I definitely over-prioritized it. Database 
 management was even more frustrating as I had almost no structure and 
 generally did things without fully thinking them through. In the end, 
 I ended up putting more hours into debugging than actually writing the 
 code. Nevertheless, I’m grateful for the experience that came along 
 with all the hardship.</p>


<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Do you think 
 you will continue working on your project and what would be some next 
 steps you would like to carry out?
 </p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Miquel</span></strong>: I like 
 being asked that. Referring to the Smart Table Assistant, I have 
 improvements in mind and I'm sure there are still many more, but I 
 also have other projects in mind. Just recently I had an idea of ​a 
 device that would help rehabilitation or just massage people. These 
 massages will be complemented with aromatic treatments and the setting 
 of lights. This device would also be for domestic use and I would like 
 to be able to make its aesthetics even more beautiful than this 
 project (S.T.A). With more industrial and improved materials.
</p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Alexia</span></strong>: I’m 
 thinking of resuming the project at some point, along with my original 
 initiative. The next step will definitely be encrypting the database 
 itself, since without that the application isn’t really that 
 functional. I’m also thinking of improving the interface, and maybe 
 even switching to a better language (I’ve been using Python, but to be 
 honest I haven’t been that satisfied with the end result). Either way, 
 I’m happy that I went along with it, even if for now It’s left 
 unfinished.</p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Ekaterina</span></strong>: 
 I think I will try to implement a library for sounds and perhaps 
 increase the number of possible notes that could be heard, scales and 
 chords. However I really want to leave it as it is to remember it as my 
 first ever written program. </p>
