    <h1>Web Sprint report: where social and technical come together</h1>
    
    <p newsteaser="yes">April 21st and 22nd's Web Sprint in Manchester has been both an
    opportunity to provide improvements for FSFE's web site, and a good occasion
    to meet (new) people, get together and have a chat.</p>
    
    <p>As a kick-off, the social event on Friday evening at
    <a href="http://madlab.org.uk/">MadLab</a> allowed for various Free Softare
    communities to meet and have a nice chat around a beer.</p>
    
    <p>Saturday was dedicated to hacking, and many tickets were handled and
    closed in a very short time. Participants went their ways on tasks
    ranging from visual aspect to usability, not forgetting improvements on the
    build process of the web site.</p>
    
    <p>After a quality meal with sprinters on Saturday night, a beer in the
    rainy Manchester and a good night of sleep, Sunday has also been full of
    brainstorming and web site fiddling, bringing again improvements. These two
    days noticeably brought us a nicer way of displaying author information (see
    <a href="http://fsfe.org/activities/os/eifv2.html">this example</a>) as for
    <a href="http://fsfe.org/campaigns/android/android.html">CC-license content</a>,
    an automatic ID generation for titles in a page, so that you can
    <a href="http://fsfe.org/about/principles.en.html#id-principles">point
    someone to a specific section of it</a>, as well as many other
    improvements of course. A more comprehensive list of achievements can be
    <a href="http://etherpad.fsfe.org/7OzqtljYzv">seen here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks Sam for organising most of the sprint, and thanks to all
    participants, among others Andreas, Ben, Anna, Hugo, Nicolas and James!
