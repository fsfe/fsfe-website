	<p><img src="./pics/europe-at-night-250px.jpg" align="right" /><em>Imagine a European Union that builds its IT infrastructure on Free Software. Imagine European Member States that exchange information in Open Standards and share their software. Imagine municipalities and city councils that benefit from decentralized and collaborative software under free licenses. Imagine no European is any longer forced to use non-Free Software.</em></p>

	<p>This is what we are seeking. And although this vision feels like a long road to go, we know that we are taking major steps along it today. To help unlock our full potential on this road, FSFE offers cross-border collaboration and its first European summit. Join us and our movement.</p>

	
     <h1>The idea</h1>
     
      <p>The FSFE summit is the main event to bring together FSFE members and supporters from all over Europe. We will offer rooms and slots during the day for our community to bring in their ideas and interests. This can be anything you like to share with your community. From your local group activity and your experiences with that to a meta discussion of collective organisation to a powerful software tool to use for our means. There will be a seperate call coming soon.</p>
      
      <p>Although this is an event for the FSFE community, we believe that our community is not defined by membership. More than that, the FSFE is a European association that represents and channels all European Free Software communities towards politics and an association that strengthens the use of Free Software throughout Europe, without borders. Therefore we will run a session in that we invite national organisations to represent themselves, their work and their goals during our summit. Together we are strong and we can make the difference.</p>
      
      <p>All of these happenings will be embedded in an environment of professional talks and presentations during the whole time. <a href="blogpost">We tried to cover inspiring inputs in and out our diverse community by offering a mix between prominent speakers and newcomers, both from various countries over Europe. In addition we cover the non-technical topics. Friday will be dedicated to business, Satursday to policy and community and Sunday to everything beyond code.</a> </p>
      
      
     <h1>The setting and the venue</h1>
      
      <p>The first FSFE summit will take place in the <a href="www.bcc-berlin.de/en">Berlin Congress Center (BCC)</a> as part of the <a href="http://qtcon.org/">QtCon16</a>. This is because Qt and Kdab are inviting us to join their conference with our very own subconference. Of course, this comes with some limitations but we are more than thankful for this opportunity. After all, it is our chance to invest all our energy for the first FSFE summit into the actual content instead of necessary but meaningless logistics.</p>
	
      <p>We are not the only ones that have been invited to share the BCC. For three days we will bring together the subconferences of VLC, KDE, KDAB and Qt under the same roof. Yes, this brings some complex logistics with it but be assured that we do our best to let run everything as smooth as we would like to experience it ourselves. And yes, <a href="blogpost">you can switch between all of these subconferences and take part in all of them</a>.</p>
      
      
     <h1>Attendance, community and volunteers</h1>
      
      <p>Because <a href="blogpost">we decided to join the QtCon as a subconference</a> we are urged to cover the costs for the location. Also, there will be catering during the day, including Lunch and Coffee break, both for free. Nevertheless it was important for us to offer cost-free attendance to our community members. This leads us into the situation in that <a href="blogpost">entrance is possible for free, but we ask you to consider donating</a>. In any case, when you register and you are a Fellow of the FSFE, please mark that you are member of our community. This will give you the availability to lower down your donation until zero or any amount you feel comfortable.</p>
      
      <p>As every community based conference, we are in need of volunteers. While the general "hands on" part is covered by the staff of the BCC (cleaning, setting up etc) we like to offer high class volunteering, means moderation, film-team, entrance check etc.</p>
      
      <p>We have a <a href="https://qtcon.org/attendee-policy">Code of Conduct for our conference</a> and we have a "SWAT-team" to ensure a save and peaceful environment for all participants</p>
