        <title>FSFE Netherlands country team get-together (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>The FSFE Netherlands will have another online localgroup meeting. The meeting will be from 20:00 until 22:00 CET on the conference server. It is usually quite 'gezellig' and so most stay until 23:00, but you can leave whenever you see fit. The meeting is open for everybody, and we'll switch to English if not everybody understands Dutch. More information can be found on the wiki. At the meetings we abide by the FSFE Code of Conduct. The URL of the meeting is https://conf.fsfe.org/b/netherlands . On December meeting, Fani Partsafyllidou and Ana Galan from the FSFE staff will join and share news.</p>
