	<p/> In the overheated city of Paris we met to summarize
	shortly all actions that are planned in the months to come.
	There is no doubt that a large part of this report is not
	understandable for people who are not heavily involved in
	APRIL and/or FSF France. However, they were included for the
	record and everybody is welcome to ask for more information in
	either <a href="mailto:april@april.org">APRIL</a> or <a
	href="mailto:fsfe-france@gnu.org">FSF France</a> mailing
	lists.

	<h3><a href="http://www.ceenet.org/">Hungary</a></h3>

	<p/> Sbi (Sebastien Blondeel) is going to Hungaria from 20
	to 30 August to attend the annual meeting of
	http://www.ceenet.org/.  He is going to be in mission for
	the FSF Europe and APRIL. He will be given goodies,
	flyers. 

	<ul>
	  <li>Stickers Dynamic Duo</li>
	  <li>FSFE Flyer</li>
	  <li>APRIL flyer</li>
	  <li>1 or 2 t-shirt to give away</li>
	  <li>1 or 2 tux</li>
	  <li>Anonymous business cards</li>
	</ul>

	He will also meet with a GNOME developer (Shooby Ban
	(shooby@gnome.hu)) who may be interested to be involved with
	a Free Software organization in his country.

	<p/> The CEENET meeting is largely attended by universities, even
	if large companies are present. It is financed by OTAN and Cisco
	in a very modern hotel with Internet in each room. The people who
	attend come from every eastern countries. The population knows 
	computer science and occupy positions that are sometime important. 
	There is no guarantee that these persons know anything about 
	GNU and Free Software. 

	<p/> Loic suggests that he takes as many contact of people
	interested by Free Software and likely to get involved in
	non-profit organizations.

	<h3>Hourtin</h3>

	<p/> The 22nd <a href="http://www.crepac.com">Université d'Eté
	de la Communication</a> (Summer School of the Communication) in
	Hourtin, near Bordeaux (20th to 24th August), August 22, with
	one conference about Free Software. Fred and Loïc are supposed
	to go together, waiting for confirmation. Fred speaks during
	the Free Software conference on Wednesday and will stay the
	day after. Loïc will only stay one day.

	<h3><a href="http://www.benchmark.fr/forumlibre/">Forum du Libre</a></h3>

	<p/> The Forum du libre conference is organized by the Benchmark
	group in September. Loic will speak at a round table. Invitations
	were requested, no answer at present.

	<h3>Cryptography</h3>

	<p/> Launching a special day for cryptography : applying to
	DCSSI (French authority) for OpenSSH and GnuPG. Meeting on
	Thursday 26th of July.

	<h3><a href="http://www.samedis.org/">Cyberbase</a> à la Villette</h3>

	<p/> <a
	href="mailto:samedis@samedis.org">samedis@samedis.org</a>
	created. <a href="mailto:yvanlanduyt@april.org">Yves</a>
	project manager. At Hourtin cyberbases will be presented on
	Thursday. Fred will be there.

	<h3>Recherche</h3>
	
	<p/><a
	href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/fsfe-france-sci">List
	was created</a>. Who is the project manager ? Joris Van Der
	Hoven ?

	<h3><a
	href="http://france.fsfeurope.org/collecte.en.html">Press</a></h3>
	Sent the article about Free Software from Transfert. Ask a
	periodic status report to <a
	href="mailto:nicole.ciry@free.fr">Nicole</a> and <a
	href="mailto:gilles.veillon@wanadoo.fr">Gilles
	Veillon</a>. For the time being one package was sent two weeks
	ago to the FSF with two articles (newspaper from france and
	from moroco).

	<h3>Software Patents</h3>

	<p/> APRIL list : analyze the report and massively inform deputies
	by sending mail or even better individual letters. We encourage
	the initiative and hope someone will lead the effort.

        <p/> Olivier proposes that each person goes to the deputy with 
	a file prepared for this purpose.

        <p/> Fred suggests sending a call about patents (not only
        software patents) co-signed by some organizations (Act Up,
        ATTAC, OGM ...), some deputies/senators and to propose it to
        the newspapers Linux Loader, Login, Libé, Le Monde, Politis...

	<h3><a href="http://ma.darche.free.fr/AFUL/generated-html/FAQConstructeurs.fr.html">FAQ Constructeurs</a></h3>

	<p/> Marc Aurèle Darche came to us so that we contribute to the
	FAQ that he is writing. We
	<a
	href="http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/fsfe-france/2001-July/000822.html">contributed to the content</a> mainly to improve the things related to 
	Free Software. Even though the Open Source aspect of the document
	forbids us to co-sign the document, we must participate to the
	writing on the parts related to Free Software. This is work in
	progress.

	<h3>Contacts Free Software organizations</h3>

	<p/>Loic established contacts with Free Software organizations in
	foreign countries.

	<p/>Frédéric says that we must work to get closer to LUGs that
	want to become GLUGs and Free Software organizations that
	already cam to us (Nice, Toulouse, Strasbourg, Montpellier).

	<p/> Loic says that most of them cannot be associated to FSF Europe
	yet because their content does not exactly match the philosophy
	even though they are close. Refusing this association is a hostile
	attitude, we must work with them on events and content that better
	match the philosophy and the strategy of FSF Europe. That requires
	a lot of work but needs to be done. 

	<p/> The topics mentioned below were shortly discussed and we
	did not have the energy to write down what was said.
