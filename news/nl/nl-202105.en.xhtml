    <p>Prolific Sci-fi author Cory Doctorow envisions the world in 2041 and informs us that humankind was  able to solve major world problems thanks to collective work and mutual sharing of knowledge. Doctorow has been a vocal supporter of the FSFE  for many years now. In his video he is celebrating the 20 year anniversary of the FSFE in his own fascinating way: Doctorow is travelling in time to greet us and congratulate us on our 40 year anniversary, talking to us from 2041.</p>

	<p>His time travel allows him to see the critical importance of the FSFE in the transition to a digital society. In the author’s words ‘In those two decades we have seen massive decentralization of the internet thanks and part to deep reforms to our anti-trust and monopoly law, mandates for interoperability and open APIs’. This is why Doctorow is thanking the FSFE for our next 20 years of fostering freedom and decentralisation. </p>
	
    <h2 id="rapid-developments-in-router-freedom-in-greece-germany-and-austria">Rapid developments in Router Freedom in Greece, Germany, and Austria</h2>

    <p>Rapid developments in Router Freedom are  being made in the EU countries as an EU reform of telecommunications law is being transposed into national jurisdictions. The implementation process has been complex and has led to different solutions which may negatively affect Router Freedom. 
    The FSFE has been closely monitoring national legislation on telecommunications and actively taken part in public consultations together with local organisations to support legislative changes in favour of Router Freedom. For example, in Greece, the FSFE and six other organisations supported the preliminary decision of the Greek regulator for incorporating Router Freedom in the national legislation. </p>

	<p>The next months will be crucial for Router Freedom in EU countries. There are challenges ahead. Differently from Greece, <a href="/news/2021/news-20210505-01.html">Germany</a> has moved in a direction to reevaluate the consolidated framework, which can lead to more restrictions to end-users rights. In <a href="/news/2021/news-20210506-01.html">Austria</a>, the fate of Router Freedom will be decided by the national regulatory agency RTR after the full implementation of the telecom reform.</p>
	
	<h2 id="achieving-accuracy-and-fairness-in-artificial-intelligence-ai-applications-using-free-software">Achieving accuracy and fairness in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications using Free Software</h2>
	
	<p>Vincent Lequertier <a href="/freesoftware/artificial-intelligence.html">published an article</a> stating the reasons why AI applications released under a Free Software license can prevent known pitfalls in AI, making its use both efficient and fair. Three elements of AI should be provided openly: the source code used to train the AI, the datasets, and the trained AI models. Being able o understand how AI works will enable us to correct unfair discrimination generated by AI and give the opportunity for everyone to improve its transparency. Furthermore, releasing AI as Free Software can  help fostering innovation in this field.</p>
	
	<p>Vincent also suggested in a <a href="https://vl8r.eu/posts/2021/05/16/artificial-intelligence-safety-embracing-checklists/">blog post</a> on <a href="https://planet.fsfe.org">FSFE&#39;s Planet</a> that the successful imposition of checklists in crucial sectors can be used as an example of good practice in AI development. </p>
