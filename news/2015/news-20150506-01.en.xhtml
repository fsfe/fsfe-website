      <h1>A restriction on technological restrictions</h1>
      <h2>The right to install other software on your computing devices</h2>

     <p>Safecast is a global project to map radiation data from around the
     world and release this information openly. When the project just started
     out, they used radiation meters, together with their own custom software
     and a few clever tweaks, to allow anyone to participate in the data
     collection. This kind of ingenuity is something we see every day: the
     ability to re-purpose or adapt existing technology by replacing or
     supplementing its software. While Safecast is a special case in this, we
     all depend on the possibility to install or replace programs that we use
     every day, to increase the security, privacy or performance of our
     devices, or just because we happen to like a different program on our
     laptop, tablet, phone, router, television, car, or other device.</p>

     <p><strong>Today at the International Day Against DRM, the undersigned
       organisations are calling on lawmakers to implement legislation that
       safeguards the right to tinker for everyone. To make sure that everybody
       is allowed to replace or supplement the software in any device, if the
       owner of that device wants it, thereby empowering device owners to
       control their own property. Many manufacturers today add technological
       restrictions that prevent device owners from changing their devices, or
       having someone change it for them. Even when those rights are granted by
       virtue of the software licenses being used by the software on the
       devices (as with Free Software/Open Source Software). It's clear that
       any right to tinker must also be coupled with a legal provision that
     prevents technological restrictions on the same right.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>To successfully guarantee that device owners are in control of their
      own technology, the following organisations ask for a right to tinker for
      everyone, and a restriction on technological restrictions.</strong></p>
