<p>
  In this issue we look into the software development of Librem 5 phone 
  and of Phosh, the popular graphical environment for Linux phones. And 
  booths are back! We are happy to discuss Free Software in person 
  again.

<p>
  Librem 5 runs the fully convergent PureOS, which means you can take a 
  mobile desktop with you within your phone. Its dedicated graphical 
  environment, Phosh, is becoming a popular option for Linux phones. 
  Guido Günther, FSFE supporter and one of Purism’s main developers, 
  reveals details of Librem’s software development with us in our <a href="/news/2022/news-20220712-01.html">interview</a>. 
  Convergence, the ability to have almost the same OS in phones and 
  laptops, benefits software development. Guido explains: “Using mostly 
  the same components across devices helps avoid developing the same 
  things twice, one for mobile and one for desktop. It allows people 
  with knowledge of desktop Linux to find their way around right away 
  [… and] to contribute more easily as it is the same technology 
  stack.”

  The FSFE is advocating for the <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/openletter.html">publication of 
  source code of drivers, tools, and interfaces</a> for the ecodesign 
  and sustainability of products. Over one hundred entities support 
  this demand, and Guido confirms its importance for hardware 
  sustainability: “Finding or writing Free Software drivers can be very 
  challenging, especially when it comes to complex things like the GPU, 
  as these are very complex devices. Similarly for software components 
  in the camera stack. But having free drivers is a requirement for 
  sustainability.” Finally, Guido recalls FrOSCon as a highlight of the 
  FSFE local group Bonn.

    On Friday 9 September, Francesco Bonnano, software developer, and 
    Professor Michele Calà will present the ‘Public Money? Public 
    Code!’ campaign in Caltanissetta. <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/Sicilia">Join</a> if you

      From 30 September to 2 October, the FSFE, together with 11 other 
      civil society organisations, is co-organising the <a href="https://bits-und-baeume.org/en/">Bits &amp; Bäume 2022</a> 
      (“Bits and Trees”) conference, the conference about digital 
      sustainability. Besides technically organising the conference, 
      the FSFE is also involved in creating content. Lucas Lasota 
      speaks about “Device Neutrality: a sustainable way to safeguard 
      control over digital devices”, Erik Albers about “4 Demands 
      towards a sustainable European ecodesign”, and Matthias Kirschner 
      gives a book reading on “Ada &amp; Zangemann: A tale about 
      software, skateboards and raspberry ice cream”. The FSFE local 
      group Berlin supports our activities with an information booth 
      there. Tickets are available now; drop by to discuss software 
      freedom and sustainability!

<h2 id="back-to-the-booths">Back to the booths!</h2>

<p>
  After a long time of restrictions in social gatherings, we were 
  finally able to have two booths in the weekend of 20-21 August. The 
  FSFE had a booth in the Open House event of the German Federal 
  Ministry of Environment in Berlin. It was a booth full of people and 
  energy, thanks to the overwhelming participation of the FSFE local 
  group Berlin. More than five volunteers were on the spot throughout 
  the weekend, explaining Free Software to the audience. At the booth 
  we were presenting <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/">upcycled Android 
  phones</a> and explained how Free Software can help overcome software 
  obsolescence. One highlight was the visit of State Secretary Rohleder 
  to the booth. We demonstrated old phones that can still operate 
  securely with Free Software.

  During the same weekend the FSFE had a booth at one of Germany’s 
  largest GNU/Linux conferences, FrOSCon in St. Augustin, Germany. The 
  FSFE <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Women">Women group</a> 
  joined and met there and discussed with members of the Open Office 
  booth the process of converting software into Debian packages. Lina 
  Ceballos presented REUSE in a <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/1CEroi8ph8oej5eFofQECJ">talk</a>.

<p>
  <strong><a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/Aarhus">Aarhus</a></strong>: During their August meetup, the FSFE local 
  group Aarhus followed the recent developments in Denmark regarding 
  potential Free Software usage in schools. The Danish Data Protection 
  Agency has, in reaction to a complaint from a parent, found that the 
  use of Chromebooks and Google Classroom in schools in the municipality 
  of Helsingør is unacceptable and unlikely to comply with General Data 
  Protection Regulation.
</p>

<p>
  The group also discussed the EU chat directive, translations into 
  Danish, and types of conferences where ‘Public Money? Public Code!’ 
  can be presented. The group will meet again on 22 September.
</p>

<p>
  <strong><a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/Hamburg">Hamburg</a></strong>: The FSFE local group Hamburg had its

  international coalition about Free Software in Education, 
  coordinating its efforts with organisations who work on education IT. 
  The team will meet again on 21 September.

<p>
  <strong><a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Translators">Translators</a></strong>: 
  The FSFE translators group met online in August. Bonnie Mehring gave

  first pull request. Luca Bonissi demonstrated the webpreview tool. At 
  the end of the meeting the participants enjoyed many rounds of 
  charades, pondering upon confusing sketches.
</p>

<p>
  In August we published the first pages translated into Turkish: Our 
  general page about <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free 
  Software</a> and why <a href="/freesoftware/democracy.html">Democracy 
  requires Free Software</a>.
</p>

<p>
