    <h1>“They are not alone in their work for software freedom”</h1>
    
    <p>
  Every year on 14 February we celebrate “I Love Free Software Day”, thanking all 
  who contribute to Free Software. Without all of you we would not have such a great 
  ecosystem today! Our Polish group joined our celebrations on 2025 for the first time, 
  and we wanted to know more about them. So, we talked with Damian, our Poland group 
  coordinator, about the Polish groups’ commitment to Free Software.

     The Polish country team of the FSFE, FSFE Poland has existed since 2018. For some time 
     there was a lull in the activities of the groups – but now they are back! Currently there 
     are three local groups, Warsaw, Poznań and Wrocław, which are some of the largest cities 
     in Poland. Together they do quite a lot and are actively organising events and campaigns. 
     For a good view of their activity you can of course join their 
     <a href="https://chat.fsfe.org/#/room/%23fsfe-pl:fsfe.org" >Matrix room</a> (Polish only)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Together they decided to celebrate “I Love Free Software Day 2025”, taking this as the 
      perfect opportunity to restart FSFE Poland. They organised three events to which everyone 
      interested in Free Software was invited. Every event was visited by 20-30 people; there were 
      lots of fun, interesting conversations with a focus on lesser known software, and lots of pizza!

      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: Hello Damian, we are glad that you could take the time for this 
        interview. Can you tell us how many local groups there are in Poland? Can everybody who 
        is interested join them?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian Fajfer, Coordinator of FSFE Poland</strong>: The Polish volunteers happen to 
        be mostly from around Warsaw, Poznań and Wrocław so I would say there are three groups overall. 
        Of course anyone can join; these are not strict groups at all and have no membership formalities 
        whatsoever. If your goals align with ours and Free Software is important for you, we invite you to 
        participate in our Matrix rooms, especially if you would be willing to help with our projects and 
        activities.

    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: What did you do for I Love Free Software Day 2025?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: This was our first time; we plan to celebrate the event each year. 
        But for the future in a more coordinated manner! For 2025, we managed to make a unified template 
        for all our local activities and helped each other organise the event in three cities: Wrocław, 
        Poznań and Warsaw. 
        <a href="https://codeberg.org/Omikorin/ilfs-day">Here you can find the 
        code of our website</a>, published by Michał Korczak under the SIC license. The result was 
        meetings of about 20-30+ people in each location. We talked about Free Software projects with 
        emphasis on those that are hidden, lesser-known projects, but important for us for some 
        specific reason.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: Was there something you liked very much about the celebrations?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: I feel like they helped us unify our standing a little bit. 
        People got to acknowledge that FSFE supports their work and – hopefully – that they are not 
        alone in their work for software freedom. I liked that we made a common template for the event 
        and that we translated Pretalx to Polish - huge kudos to Wiktor Przybylski, 
        Paweł "pomidor" Wiczyński, Kacper from Hackerspace Łódź and others for their excellent work.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: Why do you think I Love Free Software Day is important and 
        why should everybody be celebrating this day?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: Because it raises awareness in the community about the importance of 
        Free Software. It also shows the importance of work done by volunteers who help with the 
        development of Free Software. “I Love Free Software Day” is one of the few opportunities to 
        meet in person, where Free Software is the leading conversation topic.

    </figure>
    
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: What are the activities the local groups do and is there something 
        happening where new people are welcome to join and support the effort?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: You could say that each FSFE group is loosely associated around a 
        Hackerspace, which provided a space to host the event in that city this year. People feeling 
        associated with the Free Software movement just naturally gravitate towards these places. 
        We are using <a href="https://chat.fsfe.org/#/room/%23fsfe-pl:fsfe.org" >Matrix channel</a> as 
        the sole medium of communication and everyone interested in Free Software is encouraged to join. 
        I would say our main activities are promoting the Free Software movement by organising Free Software 
        events in Poland: <strong>“Sesja Linuksowa”</strong> (“Linux Session”), 
        <strong>“Poznańska Impreza Wolnego Oprogramowania”</strong> 
        (“Poznań Free Software Party”), <strong>“Jesień Linuxowa”</strong> (“Linux Autumn”) and many more.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The FSFE volunteers are, in varying proportions, organisers of these events and I think it is 
        now impossible to find a Free Software event without one of us being there. We are timidly trying 
        to get more seriously into translations and have started writing reports regarding Free Software 
        that I hope will appear by the end of the year.

    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: Was the celebration in 2025, the first time you celebrated 
        “I Love Free Software Day” and what motivated you to participate?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: Actually, the first “I Love Free Software Day” event I organised was 
        in 2017 at Poznań University of Technology. I was a student and also the Free Software student 
        club president so it felt pretty natural at that time. I had already helped organising Poznańska 
        Impreza Wolnego Oprogramowania (“Poznań Free Software Party”) and Linux Presentation Days before. In 2016 I saw some FSFE stickers 
        on someone’s laptop and the person suggested that we could order stickers from the FSFE website for 
        our conference next time. I wanted to be part of the celebration because I loved the idea the first 
        time and the timing for the event is ideal for a Free Software event because nothing much happens 
        during the winter time.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: As a coordinator of the Poland group, you managed the communication for all 
        three local groups. How was this from your perspective as coordinator and are there some pitfalls you 
        can share with us that other country coordinators should watch out for?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: I think I had a huge advantage already because I personally know people 
        from the other cities. I have studied in Poznań and the organisers are ex-members of the Free Software 
        student's club. Their friends and I met Michał from Wrocław during “Jesień Linuxowa” (“Linux Autumn”). 
        His being one of the main organisers behind “Sesja Linuxowa” (“Linux Session”) made him an ideal 
        candidate to organise a way smaller event like “I Love Free Software Day”.
      </p>
      <p>        
         In reality I did not have to coordinate much as I had very experienced organisers at hand that 
         I could rely on. If I were to give a piece of advice to people coordinating things on a country 
         level scale, it is that you need to find people with initiative and a sense of responsibility to 
         cooperate with. In any kind of relationship, input from both sides is required. I do not think it 
         would really work in other communities if I tried to force my way onto people that do not feel 
         comfortable in such a role.

     <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: Do you already have plans for celebrating "I Love Free Software Day 2026"?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: There is a LAN party culture that we inherited from previous organisers 
        of “Poznańska Impreza Wolnego Oprogramowania” (“Poznań Free Software Party”) that I really cherish. 
        I think it would be nice if the “I Love Free Software Day” had some LAN-Party-like online events 
        alongside (like those that these informal communities organise:
        <a href="https://onfoss.org">onFOSS</a> and <a href="https://fossgralnia.pl">FOSSGralnia</a>. 
       </p>
       <p>
        There we could promote and raise awareness about this kind of software. Besides, I do not know 
        if the theme is already announced but I hope everyone is aiming to affect more people, listen to 
        more talks and eat more pizza.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: That sounds like a great party! We cannot wait to see your event and we 
        will keep our community posted about this. Thank you for your time and your work for the 
        Free Software community!
