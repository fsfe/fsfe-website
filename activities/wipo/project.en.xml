    <title>World Intellectual Property Organization</title>
    <description>
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is one of the 16
specialized agencies of the United Nations system of organisations.
Its role is administrating 23 international treates dealing with
different aspects of limited monopolies on knowledge. As an observer
to WIPO and together with a global coalition of other players with
similar goals, FSFE is working towards reshaping it as a "World
Intellectual Wealth Organisation."
