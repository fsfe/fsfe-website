<p><a href="/documents/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> is
software that puts the user in control of their own computers and
devices. In contrast, Digital Restrictions Management is technology to
put the user under control of a third party providing materials, such
as audio, video or text. These two goals seem fundamentally
incompatible to FSFE.</p>

<p>But it is not only FSFE that sees problems with DRM. The German
society for computer sciences ("Gesellschaft für Informatik") states:
"If DRM prevails in the market then users will lose control of their
computers" [1].  Symantec shares this opinion: "As a result, customers
around the world will lose their ability to choose what security
solutions they would like to run on their operating systems, and be
forced to use only those solutions offered or allowed by Microsoft"
[2].</p>

<p>This loss of control means that publishing houses, TV stations, the
government (including its administrations), banks, producing companies
and individuals will not only lose control over their graphics cards,
computer screens and hard drives; but also over their mobile phones,
digital cameras and any other digital device they theoretically
own.</p>

<p>But although FSFE is convinced that there is no legitimate case in
which a society built upon freedom and democracy would consider it
legitimate to put the personal use of one's own computers and devices
under control of a third party, we cannot but recognise that extensive
global legal provisions have been put in place to allow and enforce
just that.</p> <p>We therefore consider it necessary to revisit
international treaties and national laws such as TRIPS, DMCA, EUCD and
others, and will seek to do so in the relevant forums, even though it
is a difficult task and not likely to succeed quickly.</p> <p>Knowing
the timescales involved and assuming that DRM technologies will not
simply disappear over night, has the following concrete short- to
medium-term legislative goals:</p> <ul> <li><b>DRM warning signs on
devices and products</b><br /> Customers should be given a fair chance
to not accidentally buy products that will subjugate them to control
by a third party. In order to be able to make an informed decision,
they should be provided with the information at the time of
sales.</li>

<p></p>
<li><b>Allow circumvention for lawful purposes</b><br /> Lawful use of
one's computer and devices should never become illegal. Yet this is
what the "anti circumvention" provisions of some laws do: Operations
allowed by law become illegal not for the operation itself, but for
the circumvention that was necessary to exercise one's right.</li>
<br />

<li><b>No DRM in the political arena</b><br /> Governments need to be
in full and sovereign control of their own data, procedures and
decisions. A user of DRM software, including governments, can never
have full control over their own computer. For this reason, DRM
systems have no place in the political area.</li>
<br />
<li><b>Public services for the public</b><br /> Public services should
be available to all citizens, including those who make use of <a
href="/documents/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>. It should
therefore be mandatory to always provide a way to access public
services and information with Free Software.</li>
<br />
</ul>

<h2>DRM.info</h2>

<p>To address these issues and bring them to the public attention, FSFE 
initiated <a href="http://drm.info">DRM.info</a>, a collaborative information
platform with contributing organisations from various fields, including
Digital Rights, Libraries, Creative Communities and Cusstomer Protection.</p>

<p>Visit <a href="http://drm.info">DRM.info</a> today and point others to
the site by linking to it. Help us spread the word.</p>

<h2>Support DRM.info</h2>

<p>The portal <a href="http://drm.info">DRM.info</a> is maintained by
the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), which finances itself
primarily through <a href="/contribute/donate.html">donations</a> and
contributions of the <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/join"
target="_blank">Fellowship of FSFE</a>. You can also <a
href="/contribute/contribute.html">get involved</a> as a
volunteer.</p>
