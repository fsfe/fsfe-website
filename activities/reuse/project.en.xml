    <description>
The FSFE is running a project to develop and raise awareness of best practices for the expression of license and copyright information in free and open source projects. The project is intended to facilitate management of source code by making licensing and copyright information more consistent in how it is added to source code in ways which allow for automating many of the processes involved.
