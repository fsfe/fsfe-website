Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:17.320 --&gt; 00:21.240
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:21.240 --&gt; 00:26.520
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology and I am Bonnie Merring.

00:26.520 --&gt; 00:29.560
Our guest for today's episode is Hugo Ra.

00:29.560 --&gt; 00:34.800
Hugo works as a lawyer in Paris and is mainly active in IT law, data protection and

00:34.800 --&gt; 00:36.480
free software licensing.

00:36.480 --&gt; 00:42.440
Hugo is also a longtime volunteer of the FSFE since 2008.

00:42.440 --&gt; 00:47.000
In his work for the FSFE, he has coordinated the France FSFE Group.

00:47.000 --&gt; 00:53.160
He has joined the legal team and is still a member of the FSFE's legal team and he has

00:53.160 --&gt; 00:56.480
also been part of the FSFE's translated team.

00:56.480 --&gt; 01:00.680
So he was quite active in a lot of teams in the FSFE.

01:00.680 --&gt; 01:06.880
Apart from the FSFE, Hugo has also been active in many other tech organizations like French

01:06.880 --&gt; 01:11.120
data network or the data rights.

01:11.120 --&gt; 01:12.120
Welcome to the podcast, Hugo.

01:12.120 --&gt; 01:14.680
I'm very glad to have you here.

01:14.680 --&gt; 01:16.680
Thank you, Bonnie.

01:16.680 --&gt; 01:19.240
I do have a first question.

01:19.240 --&gt; 01:26.440
The question is, what are your first thoughts associated with free software?

01:26.440 --&gt; 01:35.520
What I think the first thoughts that I associated with free software were really about the impact

01:35.520 --&gt; 01:38.480
that technology is having in our lives.

01:38.480 --&gt; 01:45.040
So it was not focused about free software, but free software was more a response, a way

01:45.040 --&gt; 01:52.600
of viewing the problem of the interaction between technology and society.

01:52.600 --&gt; 01:57.680
And society becomes increasingly technological, software is everywhere.

01:57.680 --&gt; 02:03.000
We all carry in our pockets a computing power that is equivalent to the computing power

02:03.000 --&gt; 02:05.800
of mankind globally 50 years ago.

02:05.800 --&gt; 02:09.320
So that's just crazy when you think about it.

02:09.320 --&gt; 02:17.080
And so that's really where free software came from for me in terms of ideas.

02:17.480 --&gt; 02:29.200
However, in practice, just a very, I think the first time I realized free software

02:29.200 --&gt; 02:38.360
with a thing as a concept was when I looked at all the programs I was using to play around

02:38.360 --&gt; 02:40.240
computers basically.

02:40.240 --&gt; 02:45.160
And all these programs that were giving me the ability to play with technology, they

02:45.160 --&gt; 02:47.040
were free software.

02:47.040 --&gt; 02:52.360
And when I realized that they all shared that characteristics, I started to look into

02:52.360 --&gt; 03:00.360
what free software was and that's what led me to the thinking of the increasing importance

03:00.360 --&gt; 03:06.560
of technology in society and in everybody, every individual's lives.

03:06.560 --&gt; 03:10.120
And you believe that should be all free software, right?

03:10.120 --&gt; 03:16.760
No, I mean, I think free software is really a building block

03:16.760 --&gt; 03:24.520
to general freedom and just enabling effective rights in our society.

03:24.520 --&gt; 03:29.920
So I mean, there's no question for me that it's essential without free software.

03:29.920 --&gt; 03:34.160
I mean, if we try to live in a society where free software doesn't exist, whereas there

03:34.160 --&gt; 03:42.280
is no such concept, we would be in trouble because without free software, there's a very

03:42.280 --&gt; 03:47.480
limited technical ability to check the on the power of the developers.

03:47.480 --&gt; 03:53.320
And especially with proprietary software, you have a tendency for centralizing the

03:53.320 --&gt; 03:57.000
power in the developers hired by a big company.

03:57.000 --&gt; 04:02.960
And so free software has a response to that, it's more competition, it's more accountability

04:02.960 --&gt; 04:10.040
for people providing software, whether it is to individuals or companies.

04:10.040 --&gt; 04:15.560
And it's giving you know more ability for our society to check on what software is doing

04:15.560 --&gt; 04:16.560
in our lives.

04:16.560 --&gt; 04:18.640
So it's essential without it.

04:18.640 --&gt; 04:24.040
We would not be where we are today, we would be in a much worse situation.

04:24.040 --&gt; 04:29.280
And I say worse because obviously free software is essential, but it's not enough.

04:29.280 --&gt; 04:37.560
And we need a lot more than that, unfortunately the situation is not so simple.

04:37.560 --&gt; 04:42.920
Software is not the answer to everything, it's part of the answer.

04:42.920 --&gt; 04:49.240
But if you look at the situation today in our society, obviously there's still a lot

04:49.240 --&gt; 04:52.560
of work, a lot of work that must be done.

04:52.560 --&gt; 05:00.960
Okay, quite some fascinating thoughts for the first thoughts about free software.

05:00.960 --&gt; 05:06.040
How invited you to join the FSFE?

05:06.040 --&gt; 05:16.360
I think I was looking at basically organizations that were active to defend free software,

05:16.360 --&gt; 05:17.760
to push or free software.

05:17.760 --&gt; 05:23.040
And I was looking at which organizations are the most effective and seem to be the most

05:23.040 --&gt; 05:25.560
interesting work.

05:25.560 --&gt; 05:30.800
And you know the, at the time, so this was around 2008, something like that.

05:30.800 --&gt; 05:37.000
So free software for National Europe was only seven years old at the time, something

05:37.000 --&gt; 05:38.000
like that.

05:38.000 --&gt; 05:45.440
Which in 2008 seemed pretty established already.

05:45.440 --&gt; 05:52.680
And FSFE was doing a lot of interesting work, but also was doing something unique at

05:52.680 --&gt; 05:53.680
the time.

05:53.680 --&gt; 05:59.360
It was getting involved in the lawsuit for the European Commission against Microsoft

05:59.360 --&gt; 06:04.280
on the anti-trust lawsuits.

06:04.280 --&gt; 06:10.880
And so basically the lawsuit was about how Microsoft was using the monopoly power that they

06:10.880 --&gt; 06:17.440
had on the desktop and leveraging that power into the server market to push for companies

06:17.440 --&gt; 06:21.320
to adopt Microsoft solutions in the server market.

06:21.320 --&gt; 06:29.920
And one of the problem that free software was facing in that market was interoperability,

06:29.920 --&gt; 06:34.760
which is a very easy way to say in English and very glad I chose that word right now.

06:34.760 --&gt; 06:41.600
Anyway, interoperability that was of course very important to enable choice, competition

06:41.600 --&gt; 06:44.960
and to prevent a lock-in.

06:44.960 --&gt; 06:55.760
And Samba was a free software solution that was designed to technically give the ability

06:55.760 --&gt; 07:04.000
of interoperability in the server space to fight against the lock-in for Microsoft.

07:04.000 --&gt; 07:08.160
And free software for National Europe was there to support the Samba developer, the Samba

07:08.160 --&gt; 07:13.640
project, and to support this project in Europe in the lawsuit against Microsoft.

07:13.640 --&gt; 07:22.800
And that was a very important piece of work to support free software in this lawsuit.

07:22.800 --&gt; 07:25.080
And this work, nobody else was doing it.

07:25.080 --&gt; 07:27.520
And it was very effective.

07:27.520 --&gt; 07:31.360
It's not very popular, it's a lawsuit and everything.

07:31.360 --&gt; 07:37.440
But it was interesting to me to see this organization doing this very effective work, not for

07:37.440 --&gt; 07:44.480
the spotlight, not for nobody will thank the lawyers for doing this work because it's

07:44.480 --&gt; 07:48.560
like the CSAT means, if you do the work, nobody sees it, it's only if you don't do it,

07:48.560 --&gt; 07:50.280
that people start complaining.

07:50.280 --&gt; 07:57.280
But if he was doing that, and the quality of the work was really impressive to me.

07:57.280 --&gt; 08:01.920
And that's what I thought, okay, that's where I want to put my energy.

08:01.920 --&gt; 08:03.920
So he joined.

08:03.920 --&gt; 08:09.240
Yeah, so I joined and anything is, you know, at the time I was quite young and I was studying

08:09.240 --&gt; 08:15.120
political science, and I was as fairly out of high school, you know, but you already

08:15.120 --&gt; 08:17.120
had the interest at law.

08:17.120 --&gt; 08:23.840
Yes, yes, I had, but you know, my interest in law really came from free software because

08:23.840 --&gt; 08:31.120
if you look at free software, if you look at the philosophy, basically the view of the

08:31.120 --&gt; 08:35.280
problem of the world that free software gives you, you know, understanding the power of

08:35.280 --&gt; 08:36.280
the developer.

08:36.280 --&gt; 08:38.080
What is the power of the developer?

08:38.080 --&gt; 08:43.840
It's not an immediate thing to understand for everyone because when you use your cell

08:43.840 --&gt; 08:49.680
phone, when you use, I don't know, an email service, it's an enabler.

08:49.680 --&gt; 08:55.640
It enables you as a user to do so many things that to think, okay, technology enables me

08:55.720 --&gt; 09:02.080
to do things, but it may not only be doing that to understand that is not so obvious.

09:02.080 --&gt; 09:08.120
And free software gives you the keys to understand that this ability that technology gives you

09:08.120 --&gt; 09:14.360
is also a huge enabler of power for the one providing you this technology, designing this

09:14.360 --&gt; 09:20.680
technology, making the choices of what you will be able to do and not be able to do technically.

09:20.680 --&gt; 09:26.440
It's a huge power and when you mix that with software being used in government, with software

09:26.440 --&gt; 09:32.680
being used in infrastructure, when you see that, you're like, okay, this is a huge responsibility

09:32.680 --&gt; 09:37.560
and should it be just left to the developers or should it be more of a social and political

09:37.560 --&gt; 09:41.800
problem that we should solve in a way and free software is a response to that.

09:41.800 --&gt; 09:49.760
It gives you a solution, part of it at least and that's also what drew me to think, okay,

09:49.760 --&gt; 09:52.160
what can the law do about these two?

09:52.160 --&gt; 09:56.560
Because at the end of the day, free software is using the law, you know, copy the left software

09:56.560 --&gt; 09:57.560
licensing.

09:57.560 --&gt; 10:02.400
These are legal tools that the free software movement grabbed for this political purpose.

10:02.400 --&gt; 10:09.640
And so thinking, okay, the law is also a tool that you can use to better regulate technology,

10:09.640 --&gt; 10:15.120
to better protect user rights, to better think of the framework between civil rights for

10:15.120 --&gt; 10:17.360
environmental freedoms and technology.

10:17.360 --&gt; 10:24.440
So that's what led me to think about the law and, you know, again, in the legal field,

10:24.440 --&gt; 10:26.200
you have so many things you can work on.

10:26.200 --&gt; 10:34.280
I mean, I started on software licensing because I wanted to help the developers of free software

10:34.280 --&gt; 10:40.040
to manage the legal issues to help them not be hurtled by the legal issues I wanted to

10:40.040 --&gt; 10:41.640
enable them.

10:41.640 --&gt; 10:46.320
And, you know, from there, I also started working more on privacy, take the protection,

10:46.320 --&gt; 10:53.480
which is an important field in law, especially in Europe, that also gives you keys to understand

10:53.480 --&gt; 11:00.560
the importance of computers and processing of personal data.

11:00.560 --&gt; 11:05.840
And so, you know, that's what led me to study law and political science and then to become

11:05.840 --&gt; 11:07.320
a lawyer.

11:07.320 --&gt; 11:15.680
And FSCV was a huge enabler in that life for me because at FSCV, I was able to meet

11:15.680 --&gt; 11:18.120
the people working on the antitrust lawsuit.

11:18.120 --&gt; 11:24.400
I was able to meet the best software licensing lawyers in the world, you know, try to imagine

11:24.400 --&gt; 11:32.960
I'm a 19 year old guy and I'm being said to Amsterdam by the FSCV to be part of organizing

11:32.960 --&gt; 11:39.280
the most important software licensing conference in the world for open-source and free software.

11:39.280 --&gt; 11:44.840
That's where you have the people from, of course, the NGOs, but also from the companies

11:44.840 --&gt; 11:50.800
that are the biggest contributors to free software and the biggest founder for free software.

11:50.800 --&gt; 11:56.080
That's where you, you know, you meet the people who draft the licensing that is used

11:56.080 --&gt; 12:00.040
the GPL, the Apache, whatever, you name it.

12:00.040 --&gt; 12:05.560
So you meet these guys and not only guys, fortunately, it's getting better at the time mostly

12:05.560 --&gt; 12:08.560
guys.

12:08.560 --&gt; 12:14.260
And so you meet this person and that's where the legal community, that's part of the

12:14.260 --&gt; 12:20.200
legal community was thinking of, okay, giving the legal tools for free software to thrive.

12:20.200 --&gt; 12:25.760
And I was able to meet these guys and to have wonderful discussions and a lot of help.

12:25.760 --&gt; 12:30.760
So FSCV was just great in enabling me to go that down that road.

12:30.760 --&gt; 12:35.200
Oh my God, quite a happy memory, or?

12:35.200 --&gt; 12:37.520
Yeah, of course, and a lot of happy memory.

12:37.520 --&gt; 12:41.440
I mean, the community, of course, when you start and you see the organization from the

12:41.440 --&gt; 12:49.080
outside, it's not always obvious, especially in 2009 because, you know, I think we did

12:49.080 --&gt; 12:54.320
a lot of work now to better communicate about the community behind FSCV, you know, but

12:54.320 --&gt; 12:59.000
at the time, it was different, it was a different community, it was a different organization,

12:59.000 --&gt; 13:02.200
but the community at FSCV is just great.

13:02.200 --&gt; 13:09.080
I mean, I love it, it's really open and welcoming, it's really, and you have a lot of things

13:09.080 --&gt; 13:10.080
you can do.

13:10.080 --&gt; 13:14.520
I wanted to mention that earlier, but the first thing I did at FSCV before I was in

13:14.520 --&gt; 13:20.040
intern, I joined the translators team because that's very easy to do if you know how to

13:20.040 --&gt; 13:26.440
read and write in English and French, you joined the French translation team, and it's

13:26.440 --&gt; 13:31.640
just great because you contribute, it's, it's, everybody is so thankful that you do that.

13:31.640 --&gt; 13:37.440
Nobody sees the translation part as being non-important or minor, quite the contrary.

13:37.440 --&gt; 13:42.040
We value it so much because we know it's important to get the message out there, and

13:42.040 --&gt; 13:43.720
we know translation is not easy.

13:43.720 --&gt; 13:47.960
It's super interesting if you're, if you're a linguistic nerd because I think it's

13:47.960 --&gt; 13:52.480
very interesting to start looking into the languages, the differences, how they work,

13:52.480 --&gt; 13:58.720
to understand, but it's, it's seen, I saw it as a small contribution to get started, but

13:58.720 --&gt; 14:03.440
it's valued immensely, and you know, it's, you look at many people, I think a lot of

14:03.440 --&gt; 14:11.080
people started at FSCV through the translation team because it's, it's very, you know, and

14:11.080 --&gt; 14:15.120
it's so useful because when you start doing the translation, well, you also read a lot

14:15.120 --&gt; 14:19.400
about the work that is being done, and you learn about what the FSCV is doing.

14:19.400 --&gt; 14:23.520
And so it's, it's like a double win, you contribute, and you learn a lot.

14:23.520 --&gt; 14:28.520
And actually when you translate, when I, when I translated the stuff on the FSCV website

14:28.520 --&gt; 14:33.680
into French, I realized, okay, wow, they do so much great work, I mean, there's so much

14:33.680 --&gt; 14:34.680
going on here.

14:34.680 --&gt; 14:40.400
We saw little resources, I mean, you know, so that's, that's just the community that I was

14:40.400 --&gt; 14:47.000
able to meet there is, yeah, a lot of very good memories, and the European vibe, you

14:47.000 --&gt; 14:56.000
know, I'm meeting so many people from Germany, Sweden, Italy, Spain, Slovenia, you know,

14:56.000 --&gt; 15:02.960
I mean, what else, Romania, when I was in intern, there was a person living, who was a

15:02.960 --&gt; 15:09.840
Romanian, who was living in Spain and enjoying, and you know, this, you know, so many nationalities

15:09.840 --&gt; 15:15.080
and communities, it's just, I mean, I love it, it's really, everybody, it's an international

15:15.080 --&gt; 15:16.080
organization.

15:16.080 --&gt; 15:17.080
It is, it is.

15:17.080 --&gt; 15:18.080
Yeah.

15:18.080 --&gt; 15:24.880
No, I do love this as well, I do get a very happy feeling from your happy feelings about

15:24.880 --&gt; 15:25.880
the FSCV.

15:25.880 --&gt; 15:26.880
Oh, yeah.

15:26.880 --&gt; 15:27.880
Yeah.

15:27.880 --&gt; 15:31.680
So it just made you stay with the FSCV for such a long time then, or?

15:31.680 --&gt; 15:39.240
Yes, and you know, you look at the FSCV timeline, for instance, that Max put together, you

15:39.240 --&gt; 15:47.120
see all the most important events that the FSCV, how it sees itself and all the actions.

15:47.120 --&gt; 15:49.120
You look at the yearly report.

15:49.120 --&gt; 15:54.640
These latest years I've been busy with, you know, with other things, with other organizations

15:54.640 --&gt; 15:58.240
and obviously with work.

15:58.240 --&gt; 16:04.480
And so, of course, I've done less in the latest years, but, you know, when I look at what

16:04.480 --&gt; 16:08.880
other people are doing in FSCV, you know, it's just, I just feel very proud, even though

16:08.880 --&gt; 16:13.520
it's not what I'm doing, I just feel very proud that I contributed at some point to that

16:13.520 --&gt; 16:19.920
organization and to see that where it is today, it's just, yeah, it's just great to see

16:19.920 --&gt; 16:20.920
that.

16:20.920 --&gt; 16:22.640
Because, yeah, I've been a part of it.

16:22.640 --&gt; 16:30.480
Yeah, and also just, you know, seeing that it's still, I think, doing things in the right

16:30.480 --&gt; 16:38.760
direction, it's good that it's better at communicating what it's doing and, you know,

16:38.760 --&gt; 16:45.800
there's so much to do in this area that, yeah, it's important that we keep on doing it.

16:45.800 --&gt; 16:47.600
The mission is not accomplished yet.

16:47.600 --&gt; 16:49.600
Okay.

16:49.600 --&gt; 16:55.280
And in this regard, I would like to go over to my next question.

16:55.280 --&gt; 17:01.960
We have already touched a bit that there's quite a legal framework around FSCV and I would

17:01.960 --&gt; 17:09.480
love to get an introduction from you, how the sticker framework for FSCV is in France.

17:09.480 --&gt; 17:17.320
So yeah, I know that in 2012, you had a circular eye roll.

17:17.320 --&gt; 17:20.080
It's a French word and my French is not very good.

17:20.080 --&gt; 17:24.520
I do speak it a bit, but yeah, so please excuse my pronunciation.

17:24.520 --&gt; 17:25.520
Yeah, yeah.

17:25.520 --&gt; 17:26.520
No, that's fine.

17:26.600 --&gt; 17:33.200
Yeah, I always think Prime Minister at the time, something like that, oh, yeah.

17:33.200 --&gt; 17:38.480
So yeah, I mean, the legal framework in France, so I mean, obviously the legal framework

17:38.480 --&gt; 17:46.440
for developers, meaning copyright, patent, et cetera, is more or less, more or less the

17:46.440 --&gt; 17:49.880
same in France as everywhere else in the European Union.

17:49.880 --&gt; 17:52.280
So that's a good thing.

17:52.280 --&gt; 18:00.720
However, I think on this side of things, France is maybe a bit lagging behind compared to

18:00.720 --&gt; 18:07.000
Germany, for instance, if you look at the number of established decisions in courts in

18:07.000 --&gt; 18:13.680
France, it's not as good and as well understood as it has been Germany, for instance.

18:13.680 --&gt; 18:15.520
I didn't like the law enforcement.

18:15.520 --&gt; 18:24.400
I mean, I mean, in civil courts, how to apply the law to enable free software to enforce

18:24.400 --&gt; 18:30.560
software, free software license compliance for the judges to understand where the free

18:30.560 --&gt; 18:35.720
software licenses are about, how they work, how they should be applied, the understanding

18:35.720 --&gt; 18:41.240
in the community, it's, you know, it's not as good as maybe some other countries in

18:41.240 --&gt; 18:45.920
the European Union, even though in theory, it's more or less the same.

18:45.920 --&gt; 18:52.120
Now the other side of it also is the legal framework in terms of policy.

18:52.120 --&gt; 18:58.280
So more in terms of what the French government and the French state, the official institutions

18:58.280 --&gt; 19:07.880
are doing to, you know, go in favor of free software to, you know, to support this wonderful

19:07.880 --&gt; 19:13.880
ecosystem that we have in France and in Europe of people doing the work to develop free

19:13.880 --&gt; 19:15.280
software.

19:15.280 --&gt; 19:23.880
In this area, France is doing a lot of positive steps, but it's maybe still lacking

19:23.880 --&gt; 19:27.360
a clear political vision in favor of free software.

19:27.360 --&gt; 19:34.600
It's getting there, your statements, you have more and more statements from officials who

19:34.600 --&gt; 19:38.880
are going to support free software to say it's a good thing, and for sure the situation

19:38.880 --&gt; 19:45.960
is much better now than 10 years ago, I mean, now we can find a, I don't know, an official

19:45.960 --&gt; 19:51.360
Twitter account of some French government institution who may retreat the free software

19:51.360 --&gt; 19:56.480
foundation Europe account and maybe say, okay, look at this, a campaign from the FSFE.

19:56.480 --&gt; 19:59.880
So this is something we would not have 15 years ago.

19:59.880 --&gt; 20:02.920
So you have a lot of positive things to look at.

20:02.920 --&gt; 20:08.240
But I think it still lacks a bold political stance.

20:08.240 --&gt; 20:09.240
It's not there yet.

20:09.240 --&gt; 20:13.760
So I don't want to give a, you know, there's still a lot people can do.

20:13.760 --&gt; 20:20.760
So if anyone who's listening to this wants to, you know, push, if a free software in

20:20.760 --&gt; 20:27.000
French policy, I want to, you know, kick the owner's nest and yeah, there's still a lot

20:27.000 --&gt; 20:28.680
that can be done.

20:28.680 --&gt; 20:34.160
And in this area of the FSFE has not been as strong as it has been in other countries.

20:34.160 --&gt; 20:40.320
So I think it needs, yeah, there's still a lot to be doing.

20:40.320 --&gt; 20:46.960
And I think the political momentum in France is more in favor of free software now than

20:46.960 --&gt; 20:48.280
it was before.

20:48.280 --&gt; 20:54.360
So it's the perfect opportunity to see and to get work done.

20:55.080 --&gt; 20:59.920
To be completely transparent, I'm not going to be the one doing it because, you know,

20:59.920 --&gt; 21:07.240
I mean, the time of my life where, you know, free time is not something I had as much

21:07.240 --&gt; 21:08.240
now as a party.

21:08.240 --&gt; 21:10.720
It's very valuable to have some free time.

21:10.720 --&gt; 21:11.720
Yeah.

21:11.720 --&gt; 21:17.720
So, so, you know, yeah, I do understand quite good.

21:17.720 --&gt; 21:25.480
What would be the ultimate goal for you that politics would do for free software?

21:25.480 --&gt; 21:33.720
I will, I mean, I think, you know, there are a few things.

21:33.720 --&gt; 21:41.200
For instance, I wish that the people in the ministries and in the political positions

21:41.200 --&gt; 21:48.320
would stop buying the silly arguments that some of the French proprietary software industry

21:48.320 --&gt; 21:53.120
or non-French proprietary software industry are pushing against the software.

21:53.120 --&gt; 22:00.000
Like, I've heard so many ridiculous legal arguments, you know, used as excuses for not

22:00.000 --&gt; 22:01.520
doing political stuff.

22:01.520 --&gt; 22:08.240
Like an example, I, you can hear in terms of public procurement, you can hear arguments

22:08.240 --&gt; 22:15.320
like, oh, no, we cannot favor free software because it would break equality in a public

22:15.320 --&gt; 22:16.960
procurement process.

22:16.960 --&gt; 22:25.040
And that is an argument that has been put forward, which is first, not in line with decisions

22:25.040 --&gt; 22:29.640
from the conceded data, from the courts, which are the relevant, the relevant courts in

22:29.640 --&gt; 22:30.880
that field.

22:30.880 --&gt; 22:35.960
And second, it's a fundamental misunderstanding of what free software is about.

22:35.960 --&gt; 22:39.320
Free software is not about a different technical solution.

22:39.320 --&gt; 22:41.960
It's not about enforcing a business model.

22:41.960 --&gt; 22:47.920
It's not about supporting a side of the industry against another side.

22:47.920 --&gt; 22:53.080
It's completely stupid to look at it this way because if you look at proprietary software

22:53.080 --&gt; 22:56.120
nowadays, they use turns of free software too.

22:56.120 --&gt; 23:00.600
The proprietary software companies would not be there today without free software.

23:00.600 --&gt; 23:01.600
They all use it.

23:02.080 --&gt; 23:08.280
Microsoft today is one of the biggest contributors to free software, whether we like it or not,

23:08.280 --&gt; 23:09.600
that's the reality.

23:09.600 --&gt; 23:15.720
So, you know, when you have a politician buying the argument that they should not push

23:15.720 --&gt; 23:21.960
too much in favor of free software because it would be supporting one side of the competition

23:21.960 --&gt; 23:25.960
against the other, that's really not the way to look at it.

23:25.960 --&gt; 23:30.520
It's just a fundamental misunderstanding because it's not about business models.

23:30.600 --&gt; 23:32.120
No, it's not about technicality.

23:32.120 --&gt; 23:34.480
It's about, yeah, it's a requirement.

23:34.480 --&gt; 23:38.040
You can totally say that the software needs to do A, B and C.

23:38.040 --&gt; 23:38.560
Exactly.

23:38.560 --&gt; 23:40.560
That's totally different, right?

23:40.560 --&gt; 23:47.920
You can say in your procurement that, okay, I want to buy a solution.

23:47.920 --&gt; 23:53.520
I want to get services or software, you know, you define what you want, but when you define

23:53.520 --&gt; 23:58.440
what you want, you have the technical requirements and you also have the legal requirements.

23:59.160 --&gt; 24:05.040
In the legal requirements, if your requirement is, I want something that has been audited

24:05.040 --&gt; 24:11.440
by the security community in this area or whatever, you know, you want the legal

24:11.440 --&gt; 24:18.960
procurement could be, I want the ability to, you know, to have unlimited right of copy

24:18.960 --&gt; 24:25.040
of the software because I want that in, that's how it would work for us.

24:25.600 --&gt; 24:31.000
That could be legal requirements, which per se could exclude some other legal requirements,

24:31.000 --&gt; 24:32.240
but that happens all the time.

24:32.240 --&gt; 24:38.040
You know, you always have to set some legal requirements and then the set of framework

24:38.040 --&gt; 24:39.040
for the software.

24:39.040 --&gt; 24:40.040
Exactly.

24:40.040 --&gt; 24:44.480
And free software can be, of course, you're not going to put a requirement that says,

24:44.480 --&gt; 24:53.080
oh, I only want something that is using, I don't know, some, you give some name of

24:53.080 --&gt; 24:57.320
company or whatever because these are a free software company, of course, you're not

24:57.320 --&gt; 25:00.280
going to do that because it would be silly.

25:00.280 --&gt; 25:06.800
No, but nothing prevents Microsoft from going to a public procurement and offer a free

25:06.800 --&gt; 25:10.840
software solution for that procurement, nothing prevents them from doing that.

25:10.840 --&gt; 25:15.480
And in reality, a lot of their offers in certain areas would be full of free software.

25:15.480 --&gt; 25:19.120
So, you know, that's, it's a very complicated matter.

25:19.120 --&gt; 25:21.920
I think you really have to edit it at some point.

25:21.920 --&gt; 25:24.920
So maybe I can give you a shorter answer right now.

25:24.920 --&gt; 25:25.920
Yes.

25:25.920 --&gt; 25:26.920
Go ahead.

25:26.920 --&gt; 25:33.360
But yeah, in public procurement, yeah, it's too complex.

25:33.360 --&gt; 25:35.360
I don't think it works.

25:35.360 --&gt; 25:36.360
It's okay.

25:36.360 --&gt; 25:42.840
I did like your explanation quite a lot and yeah.

25:42.840 --&gt; 25:48.880
And back to the situation of like the free software in France.

25:48.880 --&gt; 25:55.280
And very, you think the League of Framework purpose of best heading in France, like we have

25:55.280 --&gt; 26:03.280
all this organizations like Italy, for example, which somehow also connected to the government

26:03.280 --&gt; 26:06.920
and yeah, it's doing also great work for free software.

26:06.920 --&gt; 26:07.920
Yeah.

26:07.920 --&gt; 26:18.360
I mean, in this area, let's say that we've been lucky that some very smart and some very,

26:18.360 --&gt; 26:25.120
let's say dedicated individuals have been able to go at the right places in government

26:25.120 --&gt; 26:28.920
at large to push for the message.

26:28.920 --&gt; 26:36.240
And so today, you know, we have in organizations like et al-ab, we have the blue hats.

26:36.240 --&gt; 26:45.800
So it's like the developers and hackers who are making the French public institutions

26:45.800 --&gt; 26:52.800
more able to contribute to free software, they enable them to use free software effectively,

26:52.800 --&gt; 26:54.560
contribute back, et cetera.

26:54.560 --&gt; 26:57.120
So that's very important.

26:57.120 --&gt; 27:05.160
And well, to be fair, there's a lot of good open data movement in France in the last

27:05.160 --&gt; 27:06.160
years.

27:06.160 --&gt; 27:09.320
There's been a lot of work in that area.

27:09.320 --&gt; 27:17.880
You know, you have people who, for instance, sued to obtain the right to obtain the

27:17.880 --&gt; 27:23.800
source code on software used for public decision making, things like that.

27:23.800 --&gt; 27:33.440
So tremendous work that pushed the barrier back to give more room and more space to people

27:33.440 --&gt; 27:36.720
who can't do free software in government.

27:36.720 --&gt; 27:42.240
And that's where we are, a lot of steps that, you know, once about the time, we're getting

27:42.240 --&gt; 27:43.240
there.

27:43.240 --&gt; 27:49.200
And, you know, a lot of people who are doing good work there.

27:49.200 --&gt; 27:50.200
Yeah.

27:50.200 --&gt; 27:51.200
Hmm.

27:51.200 --&gt; 27:52.200
Okay.

27:52.200 --&gt; 27:57.680
And in general, what would your summary be about how the League of Framework situation

27:57.680 --&gt; 27:59.720
of free software is?

27:59.720 --&gt; 28:04.760
Like after we covered all those parts of it, we'd say it's a good standing for free

28:04.760 --&gt; 28:09.720
software in France or we say, there's still a lot to improve.

28:09.720 --&gt; 28:13.480
And what would those exact points be?

28:13.480 --&gt; 28:21.440
I mean, for sure, it's better now than it was 10 years ago.

28:21.440 --&gt; 28:27.840
A lot of positive signs that free software as a thing is not seen as some fringe idea.

28:27.840 --&gt; 28:28.840
It's in the mainstream.

28:28.840 --&gt; 28:31.160
That's very important.

28:31.160 --&gt; 28:35.840
You have some small policies in favor of free software.

28:35.840 --&gt; 28:40.560
You have some teams getting hired to support free software in the French sector, in the

28:40.560 --&gt; 28:42.560
French public sector, etc.

28:42.560 --&gt; 28:45.680
So, you know, a lot of improvements.

28:45.680 --&gt; 28:53.400
But in the face of the challenge that free software is about, these are baby steps.

28:53.400 --&gt; 28:54.400
It's welcome.

28:54.400 --&gt; 28:56.280
We have to start somewhere.

28:56.280 --&gt; 29:02.200
And we have to be patient at the end of the day, FSFE was founded in 2001.

29:02.200 --&gt; 29:05.440
So 21 years ago, that's nothing.

29:05.440 --&gt; 29:13.080
Even in terms of technology, it seems like a very long time because we're used to having

29:13.080 --&gt; 29:16.640
a very fast-paced change in technology.

29:16.640 --&gt; 29:23.160
But when you look at legal, when you look at policy, when you look at shifting the ideas

29:23.160 --&gt; 29:30.080
in the ideology and the economy, you know, in all of these, you have a lot of power.

29:30.080 --&gt; 29:35.280
You have a lot of money of people who would not want free software to succeed.

29:35.280 --&gt; 29:39.320
And so it's a very, you have to be patient, you know?

29:39.320 --&gt; 29:41.920
So I can't be pessimistic about it.

29:41.920 --&gt; 29:43.520
I mean, baby steps are very good.

29:43.520 --&gt; 29:46.120
It's much better than nothing.

29:46.120 --&gt; 29:50.880
And you know, it's being patient.

29:50.880 --&gt; 30:00.520
Of course, I think we lack, yeah, we lack a bold stance from policy and too many times

30:00.520 --&gt; 30:10.480
I hear legal excuses being used to defend a status quo position.

30:10.480 --&gt; 30:14.000
Some of the examples I've given are the public procurement where they would say, oh, no,

30:14.000 --&gt; 30:19.440
we can't do that because it should be a distortion of competition where it's not.

30:20.440 --&gt; 30:26.680
So that's one part missing and the other part, I think, is really a strategic vision for

30:26.680 --&gt; 30:32.520
the IT economy that realized that free software is an asset and should be a core asset in the

30:32.520 --&gt; 30:33.520
strategy.

30:33.520 --&gt; 30:37.120
Today, it's not, and it's a bit, I think it's sad.

30:37.120 --&gt; 30:38.120
Okay.

30:38.120 --&gt; 30:39.120
Thank you very much.

30:39.120 --&gt; 30:40.120
You're welcome.

30:40.120 --&gt; 30:48.360
Dan, thank you very much for the introduction into the legal framework of Free Software

30:48.360 --&gt; 30:50.800
in France.

30:50.800 --&gt; 30:54.680
And I would like to close with my favorite question.

30:54.680 --&gt; 31:00.400
As you probably know, we have to allow free software day every year on the 14th of February.

31:00.400 --&gt; 31:03.880
I'm a huge fan of the campaign.

31:03.880 --&gt; 31:08.600
And yeah, on this day, we encourage people to say thank you to Free Software Projects

31:08.600 --&gt; 31:13.120
or to people who are working behind Free Software.

31:13.120 --&gt; 31:19.320
And yeah, I would like to ask you which project you would like to say thank you to or to which

31:19.320 --&gt; 31:26.440
people would like to say thank you to.

31:26.440 --&gt; 31:30.040
I'm trying to think, for example, because, you know, we've been doing I Love Free Software

31:30.040 --&gt; 31:36.760
for so many years now that I'm running out of, so I have to repeat myself now.

31:36.760 --&gt; 31:40.080
So I'm a bit trying to find new ones.

31:40.080 --&gt; 31:46.480
You know, I think, yeah, I think I will choose a Calix OS.

31:46.480 --&gt; 31:55.600
So Calix OS is an Android based operating system for mobile computers, basically, that

31:55.600 --&gt; 32:02.480
is built to give as much privacy to the user as possible.

32:02.480 --&gt; 32:13.760
And I chose this project because, you know, it's all the bits that enable us to use Free Software

32:13.760 --&gt; 32:19.000
and to have privacy at the same time and security.

32:19.000 --&gt; 32:28.000
And of course, all of that without depending entirely on Google, you know, because I think

32:28.000 --&gt; 32:31.960
it's very important that the work they're doing, because I mean, first, I don't know if

32:31.960 --&gt; 32:40.400
you've tried Calix OS, but the installation setup is one of the most accessible and simple

32:40.400 --&gt; 32:49.000
I've ever seen for a non, you know, for putting Android based operating system on your phone.

32:49.000 --&gt; 32:52.200
You know, we've been doing that for some years now in the Fsefi, you know, helping people

32:52.200 --&gt; 32:57.880
to take control of their data on their phone and on their mobile computers and to get

32:57.880 --&gt; 33:04.560
rid of the Google sign of things and to replace it with a still Android based, but with Free Software

33:04.560 --&gt; 33:06.240
on top of it.

33:06.240 --&gt; 33:10.560
And you know, it was, you know, it was hard several years ago, you know, we had to have

33:10.560 --&gt; 33:16.720
these parties, right, to help people get together and help each other do that, which was great

33:16.720 --&gt; 33:21.320
to meet people, but at the same time, you know, we had to do that because it was scary,

33:21.320 --&gt; 33:26.240
it was complex, complicated, people would be afraid to break their device, to avoid

33:26.240 --&gt; 33:28.440
the rarity, et cetera.

33:28.440 --&gt; 33:32.760
But Calix OS, wow, that was so easy, I just loved it.

33:32.760 --&gt; 33:37.160
And it was so easy, not just to install it, but to have all these systems, you know, it

33:37.160 --&gt; 33:44.080
comes with microG, it comes with Afterroid, you know, all these things are already integrated

33:44.080 --&gt; 33:45.280
when you install it.

33:45.280 --&gt; 33:50.160
And so, you know, it's really to use, it's, you know, it just works.

33:50.160 --&gt; 33:54.480
And that's what we want, you know, as user who are very busy with other things, we may

33:54.480 --&gt; 34:01.120
not want to spend an entire week and installing a new operating system, or whether I, I may

34:01.120 --&gt; 34:06.640
be, if I want to install the operating system for the weekend, maybe I want to install some

34:06.640 --&gt; 34:11.960
obscure operating system on some obscure device, and maybe not on one of the most important

34:11.960 --&gt; 34:13.280
devices I have today.

34:13.280 --&gt; 34:16.360
And so, Calix OS enabled me to do that.

34:16.360 --&gt; 34:23.160
And, and you know, it's such a strategic area, the mobile device because it's such a

34:23.160 --&gt; 34:31.000
central device in the lives of people in France and in our societies here.

34:31.000 --&gt; 34:37.840
So yeah, I think, I think I owe it to them to, to, to say thank you.

34:37.840 --&gt; 34:40.600
Thank you, you go for your drive.

34:40.600 --&gt; 34:41.600
Thank you, Bonnie.

34:41.600 --&gt; 34:42.600
Thank you very much for inviting me.

34:42.600 --&gt; 34:45.560
It was nice to have you.
