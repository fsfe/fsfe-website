<p>
  With this webpage, Free Software Foundation Europe hopes to assist
  the consultation process for the drafting of version three of the GNU General Public License (GPLv3).  Information
  will be added here as it becomes available, and as we find what
  questions people have.  If you have a suggestion for information
  which should be here, please contact us.

<h2 id="intro">Introduction: What's happening</h2>

<p>
  On January 16th 2006, <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software
  Foundation (FSF)</a>, our sister organisation in the United States, published the first
  discussion draft of the GPL version 3 and launched a 12 month
  consulation process.
</p>

<p>
  At the end of 2006, FSF will publish the updated the GNU General
  Public License.  This license, commonly called &quot;the GPL&quot;,
  is by far the most used license for <a
  href="/documents/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The task of the GPL is to ensure that everyone who receives a copy
  of GPL-licensed software is free to use that software, to modify it,
  and to redistribute it.  The number of people who use software which
  is distributed under the terms of the GPL is somewhere in the region
  of 100s of millions.
</p>

<p>
  Version 2 of the GPL was published in 1991.  Version 3 will do the
  same job as version 2 but will be updated to account for changes in
  software's legal and technical environment.
</p>





<h2 id="participate">How to participate</h2>
