<h2>#ilovefs day 2014</h2>

<p>As every year, Valentine's Day will be celebrated on the 14th of
February, which will be a Thursday this year. Similar to <a
href="/news/2013/news-20130221-01.html">last year</a>, the FSFE is
planning an online campaign to celebrate this day as an "I love Free
Software" - Day. </p>


<h2>Campaign: Spread your love for Free Software</h2> 

<p>Our online campaign aims at rising awareness to Free Software and the
passionate, hard-working people behind it. Show them that you appreciate their
work – it could make all the difference!  Others already did so, to get
inspired you can <a href="/campaigns/ilovefs/2014/whylovefs.html">read why they
  love Free Software</a>.  </p>

<p>Of course, there are lots of ways to declare one's love... Here are just
some ideas about how you can go public and proclaim your love to Free
Software.</p>

<ul>

    </footer>
  </div>
  <li><strong>E-mail/Letters</strong> Send active Free Software supporters a
  message thanking them for their work. Do not underestimate the effects of
  such a message. As many Free Software developers work hard for their projects
  without earning money, a big "thank you" / "love you" is like good fuel for
  their further encouragement </li>

  <li><strong>Microblog</strong> Especially on Valentine's Day, microblog about
  how you love Free Software, and use the Hashtag <strong>#ilovefs</strong>. Encourage
  your friends to do as well, let us try to push our message in a high ranking on Twitter
  trends and hashtag timelines in identi.ca and other blogging system. </li>

  <li><strong>Blog</strong> If you are a Blogger, blog about the "I love Free
  Software" - Day and the idea behind it. Get people attracted by the idea of
  Free Software.</li>

  <li><strong>Banners</strong> We set up a <a href="/campaigns/ilovefs/2014/banners.html">page
    showing different banners</a> that support the "I love Free Software" - Day
  and that are free to use. Some even come along with code snippets to easily
  implement it on your homepage or blog.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Show your love - Individually</h2>

    application!</li>

    <li>Use your lunch break at work to talk with your colleagues about Free
    Software and why it is worth to support our movement.</li>

    time.</li>

    <li> <a href="mailto:fellowship@fsfeurope.org">Send us pictures</a> of how
