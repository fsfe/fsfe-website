		<div id="introduction">
			<p>
				If, like us you are conviced that software patents are bad and
				that it	is necessary to take action, here are a few pointers to
				what you can do. You will also find on this page all the actions
				that FSFE did, and is doing. Wether you are a hacktivist, a volunteer, a
				journalist, a political figure, or simply a concerned person, you
				can contribute!

		<h2>Past actions</h2>

			<li>
				<p>
					<strong><a href="/campaigns/swpat/letter-20101222.html">Letter to German 
					competition authorities - 2010-12-22</a></strong> Free Software Foundation Europe's

				<p>
					<strong><a href="/campaigns/ipred2/ipred2.html"> 2007-present: IPRED2
					- The Criminalisation Directive</a></strong> A proposal has been made
					by the European Commission to criminalise and increase the penalties and
					invasive investigative measures for patents, copyrights, trademarks, and
					all other laws lumped together by the term "<a
					href="/activities/wipo/iprip.html">Intellectual Property</a>".  It looks like
					patents will now be excluded from this directive, but the legislative
					process is still ongoing and there are many other harmful aspects of this
					directive that must be corrected.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
					<strong><a href="/campaigns/gplv3/gplv3.html">2006-2007: Version 3 of
					the GNU GPL</a></strong>: During the 18 month public consultation for
					the drafting of GPLv3, FSFE worked to assist community participation.
					Among other benefits, GPLv3 offers better protection for free software
					developers against patent litigation.  Our licences can only solve a small
					part of the harm of software patents, but they can make free software
					development easy in some ways.

				<p>
					<strong><a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/ciaran/?p=49">
					2006-July-12th: Participation in EC hearing</a>:</strong> Ciaran

				<p>
					<strong><a href="/campaigns/swpat/memorandum.html"> 2005-June-28th:

					has published, on June 28th 2005, the Karlsruhe Memorandum against software
					patents. This memorandum collected more than 200 signatures at this year's

					argues that software patents in Europe will hurt jobs and innovation. Among
					the supporters are leaders of some of Europe's biggest trade union groups.
					All MEPs received a copy of this.
