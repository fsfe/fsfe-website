      "Ada and Zangemann is a wonderful book which frames the vision of
      software freedom in a colorful, exciting, and accessible way that should
      connect to readers of all ages without being overbearing. Ada is a
      wonderful girl and I hope her spirit of community and freedom is
      something that young readers will bring to their own lives."
