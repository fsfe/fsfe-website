	<p>Contact will seek to explore and realize the greater promise of social media to promote new forms of culture, commerce, collective action, and creativity. Technologists, artists, activists, businesspeople, funders, and other stakeholders have been invited to discuss the networked future, and come together to hatch new ideas, connect with new collaborators, and forge an ongoing community for innovating social media and beyond.</p>
