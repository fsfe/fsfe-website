<p>At the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), we strongly believe 
in the power of internships to teach about software freedom and their 
importance for both the intern and the organisation. That is 
the reason why we have supported them since our earliest years. Over 
more than 20 years of our organisation's existence, <a href="/news/2022/news-20220121-01.html">many interns have 
come to learn about our work</a> and help us achieve our goal of empowering 
people to control technology. Some of them have stayed with us and are 
now part of our staff. Others are still associated with us in other 
ways, and we are delighted to cross paths with those who have 
continued their careers in this or other  related fields.
</p>

<p><strong>We have talked with some of our latest interns about their experience 
with us!</strong>
</p>
	
<h3>Free Software is easy to use and important for our society</h3>	

<p>A paid  interniship in the FSFE can be an intensive yet enriching 
experience. It familiarises people with the use of Free Software and it 
helps them to strengthen relationships  with the Free Software community 
worldwide.
</p>

<p>Some of our interns are already using Free Software, but 
there are others like Elif, who was an intern in the legal area and knew 
about it, but never used it because she had the impression that <italic>"Free 
Software is hard to use"</italic>. This changed after her months at the FSFE. 
<italic>“During my internship at FSFE, I saw that there is so much Free 
Software that is user friendly. Now I use it every day”</italic>, states Elif. 
But Free Software is not only about using it in your daily life. Even 
as an active Free Software user, being part of our team helps to get a 
better understanding of its importance in our society, as Sergio, an 
intern in the policy area explains: <italic>“After this internship I was able 
to better comprehend the importance of Free Software, and to understand 
how the policy and legislative processes take place in the European 
Union, but also in regional and local levels in Europe”</italic>.	
</p>

<blockquote>
          <p>
            "I use Free Software whenever I can and really enjoy it!”
          </p>
          <cite>Marlene, former FSFE intern</cite>
</blockquote>` 

<h3>Get your hands on</h3> <p> <italic>"As an intern, you get to make a 
difference in real-life situations by working for software 
freedom"</italic>, says Evelyn, who worked in the policy area, but like 
the other interns, had the chance to work on different tasks and 
projects, such as helping at the FSFE booth during several conferences. 
Or helping in workshops, like the one on <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/upcyclingandroid.html">Upcycling Android</a> in 
Bolzano, which Marlene said was <italic>"one of my favourite days of my 
internship. It was a pleasure to meet other people who also enjoy Free 
Software, and I learned a lot at the workshop"</italic>.
</p> 

<blockquote>
      <p>"My favourite task was things I have done for 
the Ukrainian refugee kids project. Because I believe the story of Ada 
&amp; Zangemann gives them hope and courage to start a new chapter in 
their life.”
     </p>
     <cite>Elif, former FSFE intern</cite>
</blockquote>` 

<h3>Become part of an international community</h3>
<p> 
Being an intern at the FSFE is not only  a step in your career in which 
you can enhance relevant skills for your professional path such as 
technical ones, but it is also a community experience. You acquire 
personal skills and get to know different people from all over the 
world  while giving something back to society. <italic>“Doing meaningful work 
that has a real value”</italic>, is how Vincent describes it.  He is a 
former intern who is currently an active member of our community.
