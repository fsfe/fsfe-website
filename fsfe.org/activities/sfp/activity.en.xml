    <description>
     Software users must be able to participate in the development and 
     distribution of software in order to have a world where software does what 
     software users want it to do. Software patents block this goal by adding 
     legal and financial risks to software development and distribution, and by 
     giving patent holders the legal power to completely prohibit software 
     developers from using the patented ideas.      </description>
