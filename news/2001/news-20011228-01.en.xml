    <title>FSF Europe appoints new Vice President</title>
    <body>
        Jonas Oberg was appointed new Vice President of the FSF
        Europe: "The future of Free Software depends a lot on
        what we do today. I plan to work to preserve the ability to
        use and develop Free Software in all of its forms, for
        example by helping to extend the efforts already underway
        against software patents and helping the media, government
        and companies understand the underlying issues of Free
        Software."
