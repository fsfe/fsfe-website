      <h2 id="Apps">The Apps</h2>
      
      <p>
        For most people, the <a href="https://market.android.com/">Google
        Play Store</a> is the only or the main source for their
        applications. It doesn't even tell you whether an app is Free Software
        or not, let alone its license. Unfortunately, most apps from this or
        other markets are proprietary. Even if you install a Free Software app,
        there is no reason to trust the downloaded binary. Using the Google
        Market also requires a Google account. It is recommended to not use this
        market at all.
      </p>

      <h3 id="F-Droid">F-Droid</h3>

      <div class="image left">

      </div>

      <p>
        The <a href="http://f-droid.org/">F-Droid initiative</a> was started to
        change the sad Free Software app situation in the Android world. It
        builds a repository of easily-installable Free Software for the Android
        platform. There is an Android client application that makes it easy to
        browse Free Software applications, install them onto your device, and
        keep track of updates. Apps available on F-Droid do not contain hidden 
        costs, are safe for children, and are transparent about possible 
        <a href="https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/AntiFeatures">antifeatures</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The F-Droid repository contains details of multiple versions of each
        application. You can also easily create and add own repositories. But
        since the initiative is <a
        href="https://gitlab.com/fdroid/">very active</a>,
        developing in a decentralised fashion and open to collaboration,
        creating own repositories is not really necessary. Its goal is to
        include all useful Free Software Android applications and to keep up
        with their updates.

    <h3 id="selection">Selected apps for common use cases</h3>
    
    <p>
      Nowadways, we fortunately live in a world in which we can choose from various Free Software apps for almost any use case. However, this sections aims to present a small selection of apps which we made good experiences with for starters. By no means can such a list be ever perfect for every individual case. We also recommend you to look at the complete <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/">F-Droid repository</a> or app recommendations by <a href="https://prism-break.org/">PRISM Break</a>, <a href="https://droid-break.info/">Droid-Break</a>, <a href="https://myshadow.org/">Me and My Shadow</a>, or <a href="https://securityinabox.org/">Security in a Box</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="browser">Web browsing</h4>
    
    <p>
      In F-Droid you can find many web browsers for different audiences. Probably the most well known is Mozilla's <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/mobile/">Firefox Mobile</a> which is available via <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/de.marmaro.krt.ffupdater/">FFUpdater</a> or its GNU rebranding <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gnu.icecat/">IceCatMobile</a>. Users who prefer lightweight and privacy-aware apps may also want to try <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.klar/">Firefox Klar</a> (also known as Firefox Focus).
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="email">Email</h4>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fsck.k9/">K-9 Mail</a> enables its users to add multiple email accounts and offers a wide range of options. It also supports integration with encryption apps and is able to read GnuPG encrypted messages.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="im">Instant Messaging</h4>
    
    <p>
      The situation of Free Software apps for instant messaging is complicated. While there are 100% Free Software solutions like <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations/">Conversations</a> (for XMPP/Jabber), <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.b44t.messenger/">Delta Chat</a> (using email) or <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.alpha/">Riot.im</a> (using Matrix), they probably will not be very widespread among your friends because their user bases are relatively small. Other apps are completely or mostly Free Software but have other antifeatures like dependencies on non-free servers and libraries, or no server federation, for example <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>, <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.telegram.messenger/">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://wire.com/">Wire</a>. There are several initiatives to make instant messaging as free, secure, decentralised, and user-friendly as possible, and we hope to be able to make clearer recommendations in the future.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="multimedia">Multimedia</h4>
    
    <p>
      Plenty of Free Software apps aim to make you enjoy audio and video on your mobile phone. Notable apps are <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/">NewPipe</a> as a lightweight interface for YouTube which adds some unique features, the <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html">VLC Player</a> for videos, or <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.programmierecke.radiodroid2/">RadioDroid</a> to listen to thousands of radio stations
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="outdoors">Outdoors</h4>
    
    <p>
      When you are travelling, your mobile phone can be a helper for you. <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/de.grobox.liberario/">Transportr</a> knows public transportation networks of countries and cities all over the world. <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/">OsmAnd</a> serves detailled offline and online maps of whereever you are right now, and also includes navigation when riding your bicycle or car.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="games">Games</h4>
    
    <p>
      F-Droid contains various mobile games for almost any taste. For example puzzlers may enjoy <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.uberspot.a2048/">2048</a> while block sandbox fans can play <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.minetest.minetest/">Minetest</a> in single as well as multiplay mode.
    </p>
    

<h2 id="OS">The Operating Systems</h2>
      
      <p> 
        An operating system is a collection of software that enables you to use
        your phone and run other applications on it. Even though Android is <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html">mostly
        free</a>, many phones ship with proprietary components and add-ons. Some
        phones also have a locked <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting">boot loader</a>
        which prevents you from booting and installing other operating systems.
        If you want to buy an Android phone, make sure that the boot loader can
        be <a
        href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">unlocked</a>.</p>

      <p>On some devices it can only be unlocked with clever hacks
        and their manufacturers tend to declare your warranty void when you unlock their device's boot loader.
        But, given European  Directive 1999/44/CE, just the fact that you modified or changed the software of your device,
        is not a sufficient reason to void your statutory warranty.
        <a href="/freesoftware/legal/flashingdevices.html" title="Does rooting your phone invalidate its warranty?">See Carlo Piana's and Matija Šuklje's analysis</a> for more information.
        There are
        also companies that ship their devices with an unlocked bootloader or
        provide you with the means to unlock it. Besides that, it is a good idea
        to check if there are free versions of Android <a
        href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">supporting the device</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="Replicant">Replicant</h3>

       <div class="image left">
        <img alt="Replicant" src="/campaigns/android/replicant.png" />
      </div>

      <p>
        <a href="http://replicant.us/">Replicant</a> is a
        distribution of Android that is 100% Free Software. Since it does not
        use any non-free drivers, it currently works on a limited number of
        devices.
      </p>

      <p>
        We ask you to help Replicant extend its support to more devices. You can <a
          href="http://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/issues">contribute
        code</a>, and <a
      href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/donate-to-replicant-and-support-free-software-on-mobile-devices">donate
    devices</a> to the Replicant team for testing purposes.
      </p>

	  <p>
	  	Phones with pre-installed Replicant are available from <a href="https://tehnoetic.com/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=59">Tehnoetic</a>
		that donates part of the profits back to the Replicant initiative.
	  </p>
      
      <h3 id="LineagoeOS">LineageOS</h3>
      
      <div class="image right">
        <img alt="LineageOS" src="/campaigns/android/lineageos.png" />
      </div>

      <p>
        <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a> is a version of
        Android which you can use without a Google account. Even though it is
        usually more free than the software your device comes with, freedom
        is not its main objective. While LineageOS works on <a
        href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">most Android
        devices</a>, it makes use of <a
        href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">non-free
        device drivers and firmware</a> which are fetched
        from a device and included in the ROM. LineageOS is the most popular fork of the discontinued CyanogenMod project.
	  </p> 

    <p>
      LineageOS does not contain Google Play services by default which is good for your freedom. However, if you really need some of these proprietary apps or libraries you can try Free Software implementation <a href="https://microg.org/">microG</a>.
    </p>

      <p>
	    We collected <a
        href="https://fsfe.org/campaigns/android/help.html#OS">information</a>
        about how you can help to ensure that LineageOS and other operating systems become as good as possible, and
        how to identify and remove non-free parts.
