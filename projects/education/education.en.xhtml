			<h3>General</h3>

			<p> The Free Software Foundation Europe actively promotes the
				use of Free Software in schools and universities. Free Software
				is pedagogically and technologically superior to proprietary
				systems. But more importantly, its basic spirit involving freedom and
				cooperation is the same spirit of education in a democratic environment.
			</p>

			<p>
				We have a more <a href="argumentation.html">detailed argumentation</a>
				which sums up why we think that Free Software
				is the kind of software which should be used in education.

				There are already some organisations which support and advocate the
				use of Free Software in education:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> 
					The <a href="http://www.ofset.org/">Organisation for Free Software
					in Education and Teaching</a> (OFSET) promotes the development of free
					software for the educational system and teaching. OFSET is an associated
					organisation of the FSF Europe.
				</li>
				<li> 
					The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/osie">Open Source in Education</a>
					Project (OSiE) supports and advocates the use of GNU/Linux systems in the UK.<br/>
					Please note that OSiE uses the term "Open Source" which we avoid for 
					<a href="/documents/whyfs.en.html">various reasons</a>.
				</li>
				<li> 
					The <a href="http://fsub.schule.de/">Freie Software und Bildung e.V.</a>
					(FSuB e.V., Association for Free Software and Education) promotes the use of GNU/Linux
					systems in German schools.<br/>
					Please note that the FSuB e.V. accepts the use of proprietary software on top of
					free platforms, a position with which we strongly disagree.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.linuxdidattica.org/">Software libero nella scuola</a>, an Italian
					initiative for Free Software in schools.
				</li>
				<li>
					The <a href="http://www.laka.lv/">Latvian Open Source Association</a> (LAKA) also helps
					schools and promotes the use of GNU/Linux in schools.<br/>
					Please note that LAKA uses the term "Open Source" which we avoid for
					<a href="/documents/whyfs.en.html">various reasons</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>
