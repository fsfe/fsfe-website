<h1>LLW 2023: learning and exchanging legal knowledge</h1>

<p>The Swedish city of Gothenburg hosted the 2023 edition of the Free 
Software Legal &amp; Licensing Workshop (LLW), the annual conference for 
the Legal Network community. It was great to see so many old and new 
faces in person after two years online, and to learn, share and network 
about the legal and licensing issues facing current technology 
developments.

<p>Two and a half days of talks and discussions about 
licensing and other legal issues surrounding Free Software in the 
beautiful Swedish city of Gothenburg. Two and a half days in which <a href="/activities/ln/">the 
Legal Network</a> community finally got together in person to share legal 
expertise during the official sessions, but also during the coffee 
breaks and social gatherings. After a long hiatus due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, during which the FSFE had to organise the LLW as an online 
conference for two years, we are grateful to be able to provide a 
productive platform for such discussions. 
</p>

<p>A healthy licensing ecosystem allows Free Software to flourish. Discussion and knowledge sharing 
contribute to this, which is why this conference was so valuable for 
the professionals who attended. One of the key discussions this year, 
with an entire track dedicated to it, was Artificial Intelligence and 
Machine Learning, discussing its ethical and responsible use, as well 
as the implications on Free Software licensing. But of course, there 
were also time to engage in other issues that have been around for 
years and that are also important for the Free Software community, such 
as Open Data, the legal implications of cryptocurrencies on Free 
Software, or the practices of “Open Source Program Offices” (OSPOs) in 
different international companies.</p> 

<p>Enabling newcomers to the community to be able to productively engage in sharing expertise and knowledge is 
also important to the Legal Network. To that end, the FSFE organises a 
mentoring programme at the LLW to support young professionals in the 
Free Software legal field, and mentors were able to help their 
mentorees build community connections and integrate them into the Free 
Software legal community smoothly during the LLW 2023. 
</p>


<p>In short, the initial feedback from the 2023 edition of LLW has been very positive, 
with interesting talks and exchanges of ideas, as well as time to 
socialise and have a coffee with new and old faces.  We are 
appreciative for all Legal Network members who took the time to 
participate in person, and hope to see them again next year. It is 
extremely heartening for us to see the Free Software legal community 
grow in strength and knowledge with regular meetings like the LLW.

<h3>The Legal Network</h3>
<p><a href="/activities/ln/">The 
Legal Network</a> is a neutral, non-partisan, group of experts in different fields involved in 
Free Software legal issues. Currently the Legal Network has over 400 
participants from different legal systems, academic backgrounds and 
affiliations.
</p>

<p>The aim of the Legal Network is to promote discussion and 
foster better knowledge of the legal constructs that back Free 
Software. The conversations on the Legal Network are intended to be 
dynamic, thought-provoking and up to speed with the most recent 
developments.
</p>

<p><a href="/activities/ln/application.html">Admission to the Legal Network</a> is restricted, and the 
discussions held there are confidential. Nevertheless, this does not 
mean that the content of the mailing list is contained away from the 
larger Free Software community. The <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a> applies to all 
discussions on the Legal Network mailing list and at Legal Network 
events, which enables members to use the information received, but not 
to reveal the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker or any of the 
participants involved in the discussion.
