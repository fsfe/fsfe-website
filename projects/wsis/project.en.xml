    <description>
The <a href="http://www.wsis.org">World Summit on the Information Society</a> (WSIS) 
is a UN conference organized by the ITU at which important cornerstones for
the information and knowledge society should be laid. The FSF Europe is
participating along with other civil societies to make sure that the
principles of the digital age are not determined by media industry and
governments alone and that human rights will not be technically invalidated.
