    <title>FSFE with an F-Droid workshop in La Ingobernable in Madrid, Spain</title>

    <body>
      <p>Erik Albers is doing a "Freedom to Go" workshop about Free Software in Android at the Ingobernable in Madrid, Spain. After an introduction to the (lack of) freedoms in Android and Custom-ROMs, Erik will present the functions and possibilities of F-Droid - the repository as well as the client. Next, the G-Droid application will be introduced, a fork of the F-Droid client, with which you can access the same repository of Free Software applications but which offers new options. Finally, some of the best Free Software applications inside the F-Droid repository will be presented, as well as extended possibilities for anonymity and encryption.</p>
<p> The event is free of charge and open to visitors without prior registration.</p>
