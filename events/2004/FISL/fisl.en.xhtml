<h1>Georg Greve in South America</h1>

<p>From <b>May 20th, 2004</b> until <b>June 10th, 2004</b>, <a
 href="/about/greve/">Georg Greve</a> was touring South America,
 visiting the local Free Software community in Argentina, Uruguay and
 Brazil to support them in their struggle for freedom and share
 experiences collected in the work of the FSFE.</p>

<p>His public activities included an interview for Argentina's most
 important newspaper, articles in one of the most popular papers in
 Porto Alegre, Brazil and public speeches such as a speech at the
 University of Cordoba about Free Software in Education. He was
 keynote speaker at the first national Argentinian congress on Free
 Software organised by USUARIA in Buenos Aires and the international
 Free Software Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil.</p>

<p>As laws about Free Software in education and the public sector are
 increasingly being discussed, Georg Greve also spoke to the national
 parliament of Uruguay in Montevideo and the senate of the province of
 Buenos Aires, Argentina to support these initiatives.</p>

<p>After visiting the foreign ministry in Brasilia, Brazil and giving
 a speech at the Banco Central do Brasil, he made his way back to
 Europe.</p>

<p>Personally he most valued the chance to get a first hand impression
 on how Latin America is using the freedom of Free Software to address
 social issues and problems. A prominent example are the "Telecentros"
 in Brazil which are set up in camps of the Landless Workers Movement
 and other areas with little hope in order to give people a way of
 acquiring skills, getting new perspectives, gaining a voice and
 building a community to work for social change.</p>

<p>We expect this trip to help and support the local Free Software
 community in their work and contribute towards building a global
 network of Free Software organisations, of which FSFE will be one
 part.</p>
