Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:18.100 --> 00:22.780
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe where a charity

00:22.780 --> 00:26.020
then it powers users to control technology.

00:26.020 --> 00:30.340
I'm Matthias Kirschner, the president of the Free Software Foundation Europe, and my

00:30.340 --> 00:34.040
today's guest is Peter Uelson.

00:34.040 --> 00:40.100
Peter is the project coordinator at a digital lab in Gothenburg, and I'm at Peter through

00:40.100 --> 00:46.840
an exchange program by the Goethe Institute in Sweden, so they match the digital lab and

00:46.840 --> 00:52.100
the FSFE and then cover the expenses that we could visit each other, and now Peter

00:52.100 --> 00:57.080
spent the last days with other staffers and myself here in our Berlin office and had

00:57.080 --> 01:01.480
time to learn from each other and think about some potential ways what we could do in

01:01.480 --> 01:03.080
future.

01:03.080 --> 01:07.600
And yes, I wanted to use this opportunity to talk with Peter about his work with Free

01:07.600 --> 01:12.240
Software, his experiences with Free Software, so welcome, Peter.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.560
Thank you so much, have a good day.

01:14.560 --> 01:21.160
So Peter, before we go into the other questions and about your work, my question would be how

01:21.160 --> 01:24.520
did you first encounter Free Software?

01:24.520 --> 01:32.000
Yeah, yeah, just thought about this recently, I actually, the first time I started using

01:32.000 --> 01:41.120
is I installed Linux on my computer around 2000, and it was after I'd seen Steve Ballmer,

01:41.120 --> 01:50.640
I think it was the former CEO or at least, I mean the boss of Microsoft, he did a keynote,

01:50.640 --> 01:56.600
he did a keynote speech on stage, I saw on TV, it was screaming and jumping up and down,

01:56.600 --> 02:04.680
and I was like, no, I'm not gonna use Microsoft anymore, and I haven't since, I've cheated

02:04.680 --> 02:11.800
with Apple, but I've never gone back to Microsoft, that's funny, I think you are the first person

02:11.800 --> 02:20.080
who tells me that the reason for them to use Linux or not use Microsoft was the keynote

02:20.080 --> 02:22.520
speech by Ballmer.

02:22.520 --> 02:32.760
Okay, and yeah, so now at DigiDim Lab, you work with a DigiDim, and we also covered that

02:32.760 --> 02:40.200
in our public money, public code brochure, and we wrote like, DigiDim is a participatory

02:40.200 --> 02:47.840
democracy framework software that allows citizen to debate attend meetings and create proposals

02:47.840 --> 02:53.680
with the goal of improving life in the city, but I'm quite sure that you could explain

02:53.680 --> 02:59.440
us a little bit more what it means in practice, what you can do with that citizen.

02:59.440 --> 03:12.560
Yeah, it's, I mean in practice is just a user-friendly web platform for setting up, like

03:12.560 --> 03:18.420
it's a participation process, mainly for mainly aimed at cities, but like with DigiDim

03:18.420 --> 03:29.760
Lab, we also work with some housing companies or, or, yeah, different like sections of cities

03:29.760 --> 03:30.760
and so on.

03:30.760 --> 03:39.040
So it's, so with, with Dacidim, you can, and you can in a sort of modular way design

03:39.040 --> 03:41.200
citizen process in different stages.

03:41.200 --> 03:48.800
So there might be like for us, we, we push, like, citizen participatory budgets a lot,

03:48.800 --> 03:57.960
and then you have different phases of, of the citizens are able to, to write suggestions

03:57.960 --> 04:06.320
on the platform, and then in the next step, someone, someone within the city is like going

04:06.320 --> 04:10.840
through the suggestions to see, oh, is this legal, how much would each suggestion cost

04:10.840 --> 04:15.880
and put a price tag on them and see if it's not, is it feasible, can we do this at all?

04:15.880 --> 04:23.240
And then the next step, the citizens can, can vote for the suggestions that they like,

04:23.240 --> 04:28.560
and that's how the, that's particularly part of the budget is done, distributed.

04:28.560 --> 04:36.480
And there are also like, after something is, like, decided on Dacidim, you can follow

04:36.480 --> 04:41.560
the process of implementation, which is a good thing for transparency also to see like,

04:41.560 --> 04:48.800
oh, oh, we voted to improve this park and now it's been done to like 50% and these

04:48.800 --> 04:51.480
other things that have been done and these things are left.

04:51.480 --> 05:00.840
So it's, yeah, so, so you can sort of have a participatory process from start to end,

05:00.840 --> 05:06.320
you know, in just a clear and user friendly way.

05:06.320 --> 05:13.160
So on, on, on what level is, is that use, so there are suggestions by citizens and like,

05:13.160 --> 05:21.320
is that then mainly like on a, on a city level or is it also used on a, on a higher level there?

05:21.320 --> 05:28.320
And I mean, it's, it's, it was developed by Barcelona, city of Barcelona, to start with.

05:28.320 --> 05:33.800
And it's being used in some, some regions and some national processes.

05:33.800 --> 05:40.800
And we, we were also involved in using it for something called the future of Europe conferences

05:41.680 --> 05:47.840
where they, they had the process of like citizen suggestions for the whole of EU where you can put

05:47.840 --> 05:52.480
in suggestions and there was a process around it. So it's, I mean, it's, it can easily scale and

05:54.160 --> 06:00.240
and I mean, we use it for like just smaller parts of the city, for example, space, but,

06:00.960 --> 06:05.600
but for Barcelona, I mean, it's a few million people. So it's, so it kind of scales in

06:05.920 --> 06:11.680
these different ways. I wouldn't use it for like a smaller association. I think that, like, that has to be like,

06:12.880 --> 06:23.520
yeah, on, on some kind of medium scale to be worth using. But other than that, you can go like,

06:23.520 --> 06:30.640
pretty far. But then I guess like, the most interesting things around citizen participation

06:30.720 --> 06:40.080
has happened on a city level for the last, last six to eight years and something like that.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.360
And with, with which public administrations did you work then in the past?

06:47.840 --> 06:58.320
Like, right now in Sweden, we have like six decedent platforms running for, for a couple of areas

06:58.320 --> 07:05.920
in Stockholm, Bootscheck and JÃ¶rg Holman. We have a city called Siktuna. We have a housing company

07:06.960 --> 07:15.680
or two, two housing companies. And also the tenants association use it a bit. So, and then,

07:15.680 --> 07:20.480
then in the past, we've also been involved in like international processes like this for the European

07:20.480 --> 07:32.560
Union. And we worked with New York and Chicago in a consortium of other companies like mainly

07:33.600 --> 07:38.560
French company called open source politics. We work with it not.

07:39.440 --> 07:45.040
How is, how is that now working? Because I mean, if I remember correctly, you started as a

07:45.040 --> 07:52.800
non-profit as a digital lab in Gothenburg. But I mean, meanwhile, when you talk about you have all

07:52.800 --> 08:01.600
those different cities and parts of cities and other projects you're working on, you also

08:01.600 --> 08:07.280
meanwhile have a cooperative there to organize like the economic part of this. But what other

08:07.280 --> 08:14.800
players do you have about Dicidim at Dicidim development? Like, when it comes from Barcelona,

08:14.800 --> 08:20.160
there are probably other people developing it from there. So, and then you said that there's

08:21.600 --> 08:29.200
company then in France. Who else is participating here? I think they built like really

08:29.200 --> 08:34.320
sort of interesting ecosystem around this. So, I mean, there's Barcelona, but they're also like,

08:34.800 --> 08:40.640
they can still contribute a lot, but also when other cities start using it, like recently,

08:40.640 --> 08:49.760
Helsinki in Finland, they've also been contributing back to the code. And then there are a lot

08:49.760 --> 08:56.560
of smaller cities, of course, that don't have the resources to contribute. So, I mean, it's a good

08:56.560 --> 09:03.200
sort of equalizing thing that the city has the resources they can put, they can put that into

09:03.200 --> 09:10.480
development and yeah, just general improvements of features. And then there are around

09:13.120 --> 09:23.280
30 sort of developing partners, which we are Dicidim lab, one of mainly like smaller companies,

09:23.280 --> 09:32.000
some might be not profits too, I'm not entirely sure, but most of them like small medium-sized

09:32.000 --> 09:39.600
companies that can work and do like local adjustments, because like for us, for example,

09:39.600 --> 09:46.000
we might need a special kind of login system for Sweden, or there's a certain way of doing post

09:46.000 --> 09:53.520
codes or whatever, so there's this kind of adjustment that makes sense to have a like at least

09:53.600 --> 10:04.080
company in the same country. So, you have this core of 30 organizations who are contributing

10:04.080 --> 10:09.120
on a regular basis to bring the software forward, and then around that you have

10:09.120 --> 10:16.240
then other contributors on a case-by-case basis, or when they have resources to participate with.

10:16.240 --> 10:21.440
Yeah, and I think that, I mean, I think it's an interesting model, and also the way that

10:22.400 --> 10:28.560
like Barcelona, and I know that like Madrid worked a lot like that, actually like taking

10:28.560 --> 10:36.560
a lot of input from the citizens, like how do we want this platform to improve. So let's sort of start

10:36.560 --> 10:44.000
like sort of citizens perspective all the time too, which I think is great. So can you use Dicidim

10:44.080 --> 10:51.680
to get new features for Dicidim? Yeah, it's funny to actually do this. They have something called

10:51.680 --> 10:58.160
the Meta Dicidim installation, and they use this for suggesting new features, or this.

11:00.160 --> 11:05.840
So you can comment and vote for suggesting new features. When you said before that, like for

11:05.840 --> 11:11.680
example, then it's also used in Helsinki, and they participated there. Does that mean that they

11:11.760 --> 11:17.040
Helsinki then actually had people from the public administrations themselves who contributed code,

11:17.840 --> 11:25.920
or other contributions? Or did they contract companies to do this? Oh, I'm not entirely sure, but

11:27.360 --> 11:36.480
yeah, I think they did both. I think they had some in-house work, and I mean, my impression is that

11:37.440 --> 11:44.960
that's it is a good model to have some kind of in-house work from the cities to actually succeed

11:44.960 --> 11:52.400
with these kind of things, like just also just to have someone to actually understand what is

11:52.400 --> 11:58.080
happening even though they don't do a lot of the development themselves, to have like the in-house

11:58.080 --> 12:03.600
sort of know-how about how to develop a platform and what kind of contractors to work and stuff

12:04.560 --> 12:10.080
I mean, that's one of the big advantages. I also often promote for a free software that you can

12:10.080 --> 12:16.720
use all kind of different models, and you can decide what kind of competency do we want with

12:16.720 --> 12:23.920
in-house? What of the of my infrastructure is so important that we try everything to get to

12:23.920 --> 12:30.240
developers of ourselves there, or at least people who understand this technology can therefore

12:30.320 --> 12:35.920
take smarter decisions on whom to contract and how much to pay for certain features.

12:36.960 --> 12:42.400
And in some other areas, you might say, well, not so important that we don't need someone directly

12:42.400 --> 12:47.440
involved with something else. It's okay, we want to have one person always following the

12:47.440 --> 12:54.240
development so that whatever happens, we don't have to stop letting people participate in our

12:54.320 --> 13:01.760
processes. Yeah, I think it kind of creates a continuity and it also makes it safer in that you

13:01.760 --> 13:07.440
know. I mean, that's also a thing I'm not relying on one particular provider with open source.

13:07.440 --> 13:13.440
There's a lot of these things that make it more stable. For these kind of city platforms,

13:13.440 --> 13:20.240
I mean, there's also always the risk that the progressive coalition of Barcelona is going to

13:20.240 --> 13:24.480
lose the next election, and then the next city government might not be as interested in

13:24.480 --> 13:32.000
platform as the previous one. So that's so I think like the way they've done it with having a

13:32.000 --> 13:39.680
sort of multi-stakeholder development process is clever that way. And it said also something from

13:39.680 --> 13:46.160
your experience that they are mainly then local providers, or is it also that people are interested,

13:46.160 --> 13:53.120
and there is not so many local providers yet to provide the services that you then from Sweden

13:53.120 --> 13:58.880
work with a public administration in some other European country, or how did that work?

13:58.880 --> 14:06.640
So now is it mainly Swedish administrations or organizations you then work with, or is that

14:06.640 --> 14:12.400
something which is easy for you to work with a public administration in Spain, for example.

14:13.360 --> 14:20.960
I mean, we've really enjoyed doing the international work here, but I think we've always had

14:20.960 --> 14:28.800
like someone on the ground like corporate wins and kind of local company or so on, because

14:30.960 --> 14:37.680
just to have the knowledge of the sort of pure like processes, how those things work on a political

14:37.680 --> 14:45.600
level and all of that, it's kind of, it's usually easier for someone with a local connection,

14:46.240 --> 14:52.000
but then there are other things that there are like, I mean, we've been doing trainings in the

14:52.000 --> 14:58.800
decedent platform and also like designing processes and how to combine decedent with physical

14:58.800 --> 15:04.800
meetings and reach out, ways of reaching out and all the things like that sort of general

15:04.800 --> 15:10.800
for every kind of process. I mean, a lot of the actual challenges, obviously some participation

15:10.800 --> 15:18.560
are the same, but the bureaucracy behind it might be different. You said before one of the success

15:18.560 --> 15:27.840
factors is that the city somehow has someone on their own or someone who they could trust with

15:27.840 --> 15:34.240
a very good connection to them to actually implement that. What are the other success factors for

15:34.240 --> 15:42.560
introducing a power-disappity platform for like a city? Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of

15:42.560 --> 15:48.480
challenges and I think the ones that succeed are those that actually realize that yeah, this is

15:48.480 --> 15:54.640
going to be a big task. This is not something that's just going to happen by itself. It's not enough

15:54.640 --> 16:03.440
to just, it's not enough to just install a platform. I mean, what should we do? Build a new park,

16:04.240 --> 16:11.680
close to the street. Yeah, successful. Yeah, so I mean, a lot of it is about trust and because

16:11.680 --> 16:18.160
you might have had like participatory processes in a past that weren't actually that participatory

16:18.160 --> 16:24.400
or nothing came out of it and then people lose trust in the process or like, especially if it's

16:25.040 --> 16:32.160
more sort of poorer communities, they might have this like bad experience from dealing with

16:32.160 --> 16:41.120
city officials in general. So I mean, outrage, communication and connecting to the local community

16:41.120 --> 16:47.200
and local organizations and leaders and things like that to build up and kind of trust in the process

16:47.200 --> 16:52.960
and maybe run it a couple of times so that people actually see that, oh, it had an impact like

16:52.960 --> 16:58.320
something actually happened this time. So yeah, so that's a part also that you meant that it's not

16:58.800 --> 17:04.960
let's make some suggestions, but that you can then also afterwards actually see this was then

17:04.960 --> 17:11.120
implemented and how it was implemented. So people see it's not just about online discussions.

17:11.120 --> 17:16.160
Yeah, and it's just it's not just one of these like suggesting boxes where you don't know where

17:16.880 --> 17:25.600
where it's going to end up or if it even will end up somewhere. I mean, I could imagine when some

17:26.560 --> 17:33.200
some people when they hear about that they should discuss with others on an online platform

17:33.200 --> 17:41.040
about ideas for their city. They might somehow think about some of their worst experiences they

17:41.040 --> 17:50.480
made on Facebook, Twitter and other such platforms. What was your experience there? I mean,

17:50.480 --> 17:57.680
when you see all those those huge platforms and how much they they try to moderate or

17:58.480 --> 18:03.440
yeah, they do the moderation there and they have lots of stuff doing that, but still

18:04.560 --> 18:09.760
from my perspective, it often doesn't work at all and you have I mean also from from the

18:09.760 --> 18:17.360
architecture of all of this it's it's built in a way that controversial things and that like

18:18.240 --> 18:27.520
hatred and other things are are empowered there and are spread more widely. How is that on

18:27.520 --> 18:31.840
on that seat and then how is the discussion happening there? Do you like when you introduce

18:31.840 --> 18:38.400
that, do you then need to get five people moderating the processes or what's your experience there?

18:39.840 --> 18:45.280
I mean, it's important to have a moderation, someone moderating discussion, but also like

18:46.080 --> 18:52.240
I mean a lot of it is designed and the way that like Twitter, Facebook is it's actually

18:52.240 --> 18:58.160
designed to create like maximum attention and and sort of divisions like this part of their

18:58.160 --> 19:06.960
business model, whereas with with decedim it's been it's been sort of consciously designed to have

19:07.920 --> 19:15.200
in to have a civil discussion and also be I mean the way that you need to be concrete in your

19:15.200 --> 19:24.080
suggestions like you can you know you're you can't just come and say like oh I think this is about

19:24.080 --> 19:31.280
this and that you need to be like oh how are we going to use this money to improve my local area?

19:32.080 --> 19:38.720
and I guess like the connection to your local area, I mean you don't want to destroy that

19:44.080 --> 19:50.000
I mean there might be stuff that you don't agree with but usually it's like oh should we put

19:50.000 --> 19:55.040
money into making a football pitch? No I'm not interested in sports, I want like cultural

19:55.440 --> 20:01.040
activities like that's that's more the kind of divisions you're going to get. But I mean I

20:01.040 --> 20:06.480
could imagine that some discussions also could get quite heated yeah for example if you think about

20:07.200 --> 20:14.080
should we close this street and just have this as like for for children playing or do we

20:14.080 --> 20:22.400
a transfer this street into a bicycle street? So I mean is that then still civilized or then

20:22.400 --> 20:31.280
other people getting into very heated discussions on the platforms? I mean from my experiences

20:32.080 --> 20:38.080
you should live very civil and like but I think there's also a balance to think about like I mean

20:38.080 --> 20:43.840
you do need places where people can vent issues that are important to them I mean you don't you don't

20:43.840 --> 20:52.160
only create like a hateful environment but you also need like areas of like constructive

20:52.160 --> 20:58.480
discussions and you need I think like one of the things that motivating me is that I think that

20:58.480 --> 21:05.360
this kind of I mean opening up to this kind of more constructive discussions I believe could be

21:05.360 --> 21:12.240
a way to to take like momentum away from these kind of parties that's just political parties

21:12.560 --> 21:22.640
just about like people being upset and like blaming immigrants or whatever I don't know I think

21:22.640 --> 21:30.000
there is a lot of like political energy that has to be directed in different in in more constructive

21:30.000 --> 21:38.240
ways and and I mean unfortunately social media is doing it the completely wrong way but

21:39.200 --> 21:45.280
we do need like places for for discussion and for discussing with people that we maybe

21:45.280 --> 21:52.560
not meet in our daily life so yeah so I'm still I mean that's the hopeful view of

21:53.600 --> 22:00.160
internet based discussion that you can still have a respectful discussion that you tolerate

22:00.160 --> 22:06.560
yeah person yeah it sounds utopian when you look at like how many things function today but I think

22:07.440 --> 22:16.560
I mean there is the least I can impossible one question I have is did you see any or where there any

22:18.400 --> 22:26.720
any processes for the tools where you saw that this discussion isn't working like that in this

22:26.720 --> 22:35.840
area and you have to change processes because you it's it's handled differently in this culture

22:35.920 --> 22:41.120
do you experience something like that when when you work with different region when you saw that

22:41.120 --> 22:45.520
like someone else was using the software and they said like that's not going to work for us we need

22:45.520 --> 22:53.200
another we need to redesign this part for us because that's not how how people interact in other in

22:53.200 --> 23:04.880
our region or in our city or yeah I mean like our our challenges often to get people to to participate

23:04.960 --> 23:16.400
more like I think I mean and and to sort of also try to adjust this to make it easy to

23:17.840 --> 23:24.080
to make a suggestion without creating an account for example or or like find ways to where you can

23:24.080 --> 23:31.600
put down your suggestions easily on just a tablet or something in the street and yeah those kind of

23:31.680 --> 23:41.840
leveraging those kind of pressures I think like for some of some of this came more natural in Spain

23:41.840 --> 23:47.360
where they where it's I mean the platform and the people behind it it came out of this social

23:47.360 --> 23:54.560
movement where there was like a big consensus on we want more democracy we want more transparency

23:55.280 --> 24:03.840
and yeah so the engagement was already there anyway like so you say that when you go to the

24:03.840 --> 24:12.480
north of Sweden then you can already be happy when you get a yeah yeah exactly okay yeah

24:14.480 --> 24:22.480
and but I mean one one thing for me then is of like what what are some nice outcomes you you saw

24:22.560 --> 24:28.800
there and why you think it's it's worth participating there I mean do you have two or three examples

24:28.800 --> 24:36.720
what what came up in an inner process which was used on the with that CDM and then the city or the

24:36.720 --> 24:44.640
region they they had something I thought like I really liked that yeah and yeah what have we got

24:44.640 --> 24:51.120
I mean I know like on on a bigger scale in when I've done this in Madrid it's been like both

24:51.200 --> 25:00.000
stuff like having a better coordinated system for the local transports you can use the same card

25:00.000 --> 25:04.080
for everything within the city which you couldn't before that was one of the suggestions come up

25:04.080 --> 25:12.880
and another thing was like in a more major to have to make like Madrid carbon neutral in in 20

25:12.880 --> 25:19.360
years so they've started to and that was actually like decided on the on the digital platform

25:19.440 --> 25:24.960
and they've started to make measurements for it to happen now Madrid does turn like

25:25.840 --> 25:32.560
have a right wing okay government at the moment so that's kind of hold to the process a bit but

25:32.560 --> 25:38.800
yeah there was like some some really interesting like major decisions coming out of of their

25:39.600 --> 25:47.120
local of the digital platform and the process around it for for our part is more the kind of

25:47.120 --> 25:54.480
stuff that we do for housing associations or local areas is more like yeah let's do this this

25:54.480 --> 25:59.200
cultural trade or let's improve this football pitch or whatever but I mean it's still good stuff

26:00.320 --> 26:06.560
it gets people a better connection to their area so often the small things which might have a

26:07.280 --> 26:17.280
improvement for for life yeah hopefully oh okay then my last question about this it

26:17.280 --> 26:27.680
would be like what larger challenges between like parts of getting citizen to participate in

26:27.680 --> 26:33.600
their what what challenges do you see in general for the for the platform itself in comparison to

26:33.600 --> 26:42.480
the proprietary environment around which is probably also trying to get some some parts there

26:44.640 --> 26:49.920
yeah I think I mean I think there like things to be concerned about and it's I mean it's

26:49.920 --> 26:58.400
extremely clear how different the just the business model around the proprietary software is

26:58.480 --> 27:07.360
in Sweden like from like the stuff that I know it's so different like you almost always has this

27:07.360 --> 27:13.840
kind of monopoly situation for each kind of platform like there are like two companies that

27:14.640 --> 27:18.720
work together and make all the school platforms for Sweden and there was lots of

27:21.680 --> 27:26.240
attention around this these guys in Stockholm were made their own open source platform but

27:26.240 --> 27:32.000
so yeah so you have yeah because it's a small market and there's always there's some

27:32.000 --> 27:39.840
and there's like an instant monopoly situation in an every kind of platform and yeah so my I mean

27:39.840 --> 27:46.480
my concern would be that you would get this in sits and participation too or that I could have

27:46.480 --> 27:51.600
a company that create maybe I shouldn't give them the idea but it's probably not listening

27:51.680 --> 27:57.680
but say that they have a more sort of general platform for local authorities and then they just

27:57.680 --> 28:05.600
make like the participation thing a plug-in so so it's easy to make it really easy for the local

28:05.600 --> 28:12.640
authorities to start using this and things like this I mean whereas like with the open source

28:12.640 --> 28:17.760
community we're a part of it's there's a natural cooperation between different companies different

28:17.760 --> 28:25.680
cities so yeah I mean there's that on the other hand I mean I think like sits and participation

28:25.680 --> 28:35.760
is a good example of I mean the advantages of free software and like because it's I mean it's

28:35.760 --> 28:41.920
crucial that you can control what's actually happening as no one is manipulating the votes for

28:41.920 --> 28:49.440
example and things like that and also because it it needs to be a platform that is like widely adopted

28:49.440 --> 28:57.840
by as many people as possible the user interface and the user friendliness is super important so

29:00.160 --> 29:09.440
so for us I mean even besides all the other points with free software it was so obvious that

29:10.000 --> 29:17.600
that platforms like Destiny for example where Barcelona's already put in a lot of resources

29:17.600 --> 29:25.200
into a platform they like weigh ahead of every proprietary platform just from a design perspective

29:25.200 --> 29:34.640
so yeah so I mean there are tons of advantages it's just like the awareness about this

29:34.720 --> 29:43.280
on a city level in small cities soft not there well let's see when people are listening

29:43.280 --> 29:48.880
and they'll tell us what free software tools are already out there maybe that will make a difference

29:51.120 --> 29:59.840
so we have to come to an end now but there's one question I'm asking every person whom I have as a

29:59.840 --> 30:08.240
guest in our podcast and that is if there are any free software projects individuals out there

30:08.240 --> 30:17.600
whom you would like to thank oh I mean I'm happy about the people who started this team

30:19.760 --> 30:25.680
I maybe I should I worked with the Drupal for maybe eight years and made a living from that so thank

30:25.760 --> 30:37.280
you to those people too yeah the console platform environment rate city environment rate

30:37.280 --> 30:45.040
so it's also great so that's my main ones I think thank you Dan
