		<title>Open Source Preservation Workshop in Stockholm, Sweden</title> 
 
		<body> 
			<p> Peter Bubestinger and Till Jaeger from FSFE and others 
			will give insights on how memory institutions and cultural 
			heritage organisations worldwide are increasingly empowered 
			by Free Software licensed tools. This workshop is part of the 
			PREFORMA project, in which 3 format conformance checkers have 
			been developed to check and validate document-, image- and 
			audiovisual files. Topics like format obsolescence, vendor 
			lock-in or interoperability issues of proprietary implementations 
			are being addressed in this workshop. </p>
