<p>
  Greece is one step closer to securing Router Freedom, but regulators 
  are excluding fiber (FTTH) connections from the legislation. A 
  coalition of organisations, allies of the FSFE, is now requesting 
  that lawmakers reconsider this and thus safeguard the freedom of all 
  users.
</p>

<p>
  Since 2021, the <a href="/news/2021/news-20210505-01.html">regulatory 
  process</a> that defines the network termination point (the NTP) in 
  Greece has been carried out by the Hellenic Telecommunications and 
  Post Commission <a href="https://www.eett.gr/">(EETT)</a>. Defining 
  the NTP is necessary to determine whether users have the right to 
  choose their own router and modem or if their Internet Service 
  Providers (ISPs) have the final say over network equipment.
</p>

<p>
  In April 2022, we welcomed that the Greek regulator proposed 
  legislation safeguarding Router Freedom for common networks, such as 
  DSL and coaxial. This is a leap forward in safeguarding consumer 
  rights. However, in the same proposal, EETT has explicitly excluded 
  fiber connections (FTTH), a decision that has the potential of 
  negatively impacting end-users’ rights. The proposed regulation sets 
  the NTP for fiber connections in a position that would make the 
  optical terminal equipment part of the ISPs’ networks, making home 
  network access equipment the property of the ISP.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE assisted a coalition of organisations to respond to the 
  EETT’s <a href="https://www.eett.gr/opencms/opencms/admin_EN/News/news_0611.html">public 
  consultation</a>, supporting the regulator to implement Router 
  Freedom for all types of internet connection, including FTTH.

<h2 id="why-securing-router-freedom-for-fiber-is-a-must">Why securing Router Freedom for fiber is a must</h2>

<p>
  Backed up by empirical data gathered from our <a 
  href="https://survey.fsfe.org/index.php/628449">Router Freedom 
  Survey</a>, we demonstrated in <a 
  href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-eett-ntp1-en.pdf">our 
  submission</a> that defining the NTP at the passive point also for 
  fiber represents the best and only future-proof regulatory solution 
  that achieves striking the balance among consumer protection, fair 
  competition of terminal equipment markets, privacy, and security, as 
  well as sustainability of the telecom sector.
</p>

<p>Regarding FTTH, the survey responses report the following issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Proprietary devices</strong>. Generally ONT devices are proprietary and 
    owned by ISPs. Because the devices are proprietary, end-users are not allowed to 
    inspect the source code of drivers and firmware running on the 
    devices, raising the level of insecurity and uncertainty as to which 
    functions the device is performing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Undeveloped ONT market</strong>. The ONT market has still not developed in Europe. ONT devices are not easily available at retail stores and 
    alternatives are not openly available. There are routers that have 
    ONT built-in, but these alternatives are currently 
    &quot;semi-closed&quot;, and come with proprietary firmware.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Unlawful technical and commercial hurdles</strong>. Even in countries where 
    free choice of terminal equipment is a reality – like Germany and 
    the Netherlands – ISPs still impose several barriers to force use 
    of their own equipment on end-users. Within these jurisdictions, 
    network topologies would allow the connection of personal equipment 
    without any serious issues, ISPs make it cumbersome to replace 
    their terminals by not providing login data or other access 
    credentials, not offering technical support for the network as well 
    as threatening end-users with contract termination. These barriers 
    reportedly discourage end-users from deploying their own equipment and 
    are in flagrant non-compliance with telecommunications laws.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="router-freedom-striking-a-balance-between-isps-and-end-users-interests">Router Freedom: striking a balance between ISPs&#39; and end-users&#39; interests</h2>

<p>
  Determining the position of the NTP has a direct impact on divergent 
  interests of end-users and ISPs. While major ISPs seek to cover their 
  high investments in the deployment of new-generation networks, 
  end-users suffer with commercial practices that restrict their 
  legitimate rights to exercise digital freedoms. Therefore, we have 
  urged EETT to safeguard end-users&#39; interests by counterbalancing 
  the very restrictive arguments of ISPs on device security and network 
  integrity with the real technological necessities encountered in real 
  life.
</p>

<p>
  Looking through the historical perspective, the approach taken by 
  telecom operators follows a consistent pattern when new technologies 
  emerge. Since 2001 we have experienced this argumentation pattern 
  being raised by ISPs. <a href="/news/2020/news-20200302-01.html">Network 
  security and integrity are the “scapegoats”</a> for every emerging 
  technology by which end-users could have higher degrees of freedom. 
  The same restrictive behaviour and argumentation used to limit free 
  choice of terminal equipment in fiber networks were previously used 
  when DSL and coax technologies were being laid down. However, as our 
  data demonstrates, ISPs&#39; concerns do not resound in reality, as 
  the number of disruptions caused by end-users is insignificantly low. 
  This situation clearly shows that there is no <a href="/news/2020/news-20200601-01.html">objective 
  technological necessity</a> to exclude FTTH from the standard passive 
  position of the NTP.
</p>

<p>
  Digital rights should not be compromised just because a product, the 
  optical network terminal, is not yet widely available on the market. 
  Keeping the network termination point at the passive physical point 
  for fiber networks will legally make sure that people can use their 
  own equipment. Securing the right to Router Freedom in 
  next-generation networks will foster innovation in the terminal 
  equipment market.

Make it compatible with your devices. Configure, improve, and repair your router. Its performance should be up to you. #4. Avoid a router monopoly. If you can only use the equipment provided by a single company, your possibilities might be less secure or user-friendly. And you will have no alternative. Get the most out of the innovations in the router market."/>

<p>
  As we said in our submission, more than 90% of the survey respondents 
  manifested support for regulatory policies safeguarding the right to 
  choose and use routers and modems.
</p>

<p>
  Fiber networks are the connections of the future. The EETT has taken a courageous position to set the position of the NTP at the passive point for legacy networks, but we reinforce the urge for guaranteeing the free choice of terminal equipment for the next generations and emerging technologies. End-users recognise the need to maintain a safe, open, and secure internet connection. Allowing them to choose and use their own equipment is a fundamental step in this direction.
