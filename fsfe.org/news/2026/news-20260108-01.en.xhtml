	<h1>Ada &amp; Zangemann available to pre-order in Dutch </h1>

	Rikken and others. Be the first to get the book by buying it at the
	FOSDEM conference in Brussels in the weekend of 31 January or pre-order

<p>It was a lot of work during the last months for me as an FSFE
volunteer beside my work commitments. But in the last week of my
vacation I finalised it: the book "Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of
Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream" is available for
pre-order in Dutch! The story for kids and adults explains in an
understandable way the importance of control over technology. It has
been translated and published thanks to many volunteers who joined me in
this process.</p>

<p>Bound as a hard-cover it makes for a nice gift that will last, no
matter if you gift it to children, parents, siblings, your local library
or in the work context of your boss, your employees, or your business
partners.)</p>

<p>
Be the first to get the book by buying it at the FOSDEM conference in 
Brussels in the weekend of 31 January. If you would like one or more 
copies of the book, please <a 
href="mailto:nico.rikken@fsfe.org?subject=FOSDEM">let me know how 
many</a> you intend to pick-up at FOSDEM, so I can bring enough with me.

The illustration depicts a young Black girl sitting at a desk cluttered with books, a smartphone on a stand, wires, a laptop, and other gadgets, as if she is tinkering on a project and/or coding, with tools and electronic components scattered around her."/>

<p>Can't attend FOSDEM? No problem, the book is already available for
pre-order in the Netherlands and Belgium through book stores. Please
pre-order now, get it from 2 February onwards, and proof the publishing
industry that people buy a great book even though it is available under
an Open Educational Resource license.</p>

<p>Please contact me if you want to buy a box of books for your company
to gift the book to employees or partners, or if you have ideas for
promotion.</p>

<p>At FOSDEM the FSFE's president Matthias Kirschner and I will also
have a main track talk on Sunday 1 February 14:00 about <a 
href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/R9Q9ZP-ada-zangemann-bestseller-automation/">"Automating
translation of a bestseller to spark children's interest in coding".</a>
