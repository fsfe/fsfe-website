      <p>The Fediverse is a large, decentralised social network that continues to grow. Since its beginnings in 2008, text-based platforms such as StatusNet, Friendica and Mastodon have dominated. In this session,  Tobias Diekershoff takes a look at what’s out there in the network that’s beyond just text. Starting with well-known video and image-sharing services such as Peertube and Pixelfed, we will explore other projects and the opportunities they offer creative podcasters, streamers and 3d artists.</p>
     <p>If you are not familiar with the Fediverse, please watch Tobias&#039; presentation from last year, “about:Fediverse“, which will introduce you to this social network alternative.<br />
