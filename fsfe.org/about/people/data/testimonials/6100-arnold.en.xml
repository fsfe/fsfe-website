      Free Software needs a voice in politics. We volunteers do amazing things
      together, but some tasks are not that much fun, or are time sensitive or
      need extensive expertise. FSFE can only tap its full potential with paid
      staff to do the things the volunteers wouldn't get to. By now, I met all
      of the staff and can say that I don't regret a cent I've given to allow
      the FSFE to operate.
