    <h1>Free Software in Education</h1>

    <p id="introduction"> 
      We actively promote the use of Free Software in schools and
      universities as it encourages schooling of understanding over
      product training and upholds the scientific principle.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have set up an <a
        href="/activities/education/eduteam.en.html">Education Task
        Force</a> to focus on these efforts.  It acts as a hub and works on
      monitoring the European situation.  We participate in Free Software
      events and assist other initiatives in making the change possible. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The team currently develops a guide how to successfully deploy
      Free Software in schools and universities.  Amongst other
      arguments here are four of the key benefits:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Sharing:</strong> Using free software allows schools to
        teach children to share and cooperate.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Learning to program:</strong> The possibility/freedom to
        tinker motivates children to learn more.
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <strong>Easy to administer:</strong> Free Software is stable,
        secure and reliable.  It offers unrestricted access to the source
        code, thus allowing to modify or adapt it to the schools'
        needs.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Licenses:</strong> With Free Software, teachers can give
        a copy to each student.  There is no risk to mislead any child
        to use an illegal copy.
      </li>
    </ul>
