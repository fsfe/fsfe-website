4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,440
notes.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,720
As you implement and ultimately what our views are on these questions or what does technological

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,600
sovereignty mean to us, what activity needs to be undertaken and what do we want to see

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,240
to achieve this European technological sovereignty, but also what do we need to do when we look

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:52,360
at our infrastructure?

9
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,760
Let's get started.

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,160
Welcome to the software freedom podcast.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,760
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,960
We are a charity that empowers users to take control of technology and I'm Bonnie

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Mary.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,000
Today I'm here with Alexander Zanda.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,320
Alex is the senior policy consultant for the FSFE and as you have already heard in

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,640
previous episodes in his work for the FSFE, he monitors the current happenings in the

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,080
European Union and also pushes for the recognition of free software.

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,800
In this policy and it will episode, Alex and I will talk about the European technological

19
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,040
sovereignty and digital infrastructure.

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
Any?

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,880
Yeah, Alex, I'm sorry, I'm a bit, I have a bit of a flu or cold, I hope you can bear

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
with me.

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,200
At least we are not in the same room, so you can't get together, I'm so happy that you

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
can bear with me.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,600
Yeah, thanks for having me again.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,880
So I had to search in the internet what any is.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,480
Could you explain this to us a bit?

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,720
I know now that it's own infrastructure procedure, but yeah, it's spelled in capital letters

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,880
so it got the feeling there is something bigger behind us.

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,280
Yeah, it's an initiative procedure and it's an initiative procedure from the European

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
Parliament.

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,560
The European Parliament can up with discussions, proposals, reports, initiatives, in this

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,520
case, own initiatives to address topics they want to talk about where they have the feeling

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:38,720
that, for example, the European Commission is not working enough on some things or basically

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,680
these reports are to nudge the Commission to get active and also on the same time to

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,600
present the views of the European Parliament towards the Commission.

37
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,880
So since the European Commission is the entity that proposes law in the European Union,

38
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,080
so you can basically say that the European Parliament is asking with this own initiative

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,080
procedure with this report for lawmaking which then should come from the European Commission.

40
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,000
So one could say this is preparatory work from the European Parliament to address a topic

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,920
in this case, European technological sovereignty and digital infrastructure where they believe

42
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,720
that they want to present some views and that the European Commission, like based on these

43
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,920
views, then later on should get active and propose law which is going in this direction.

44
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:39,960
So it's first basically a request to get active in a specific area to identify gaps in lawmaking

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,040
and also second to also already present some positions and tell the Commission the views

46
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,880
of the European Parliament in order to allow their majorities afterwards so that the Commission

47
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,320
is presenting something which also finds majorities later in the Parliament, for example.

48
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,960
So that's the procedure and so one could say so this is happening in the EATRA

49
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,480
committee in this case so that's the committee for industry and the members of this committee

50
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,120
and the Parliament said we have some issues with sovereignty and our digital infrastructure.

51
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,040
We need to get active here and that's why they decided to write a report.

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,560
This was happening now so the report, the Trump report was presented in the European Parliament

53
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,600
and now the European Parliament discusses the proposal of the rapporteur and then we come up as

54
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,800
final report and push this towards member states and the Commission to get active in this area.

55
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,000
All right thank you very much one question regarding the any process.

56
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:48,120
Does this often lead to a law then or is this most often then without any effect?

57
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,640
No it's it normally leads to something so the latest example we all know is for example the AI

58
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,040
Act so the European Parliament started to work on the topic of AI very very early many many years ago.

59
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,640
They started to do this with this initiative report they even created their own committee for this

60
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,920
just to work on this topic and to present. So the position of the European Parliament

61
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,840
already to the Commission while they were working on their own proposal so it's very common

62
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,280
that the European Parliament gets active and tells the Commission where they want to see law

63
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:31,240
however the Commission do not have to react but in terms of goodwill and democracy normally the

64
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,680
Commission picks these reports up they are also part of the debate so they are also sitting in

65
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,360
the European Parliament giving statements to the report giving their views on the report so they

66
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:50,280
also already interact during this procedure with the European Parliament and normally it won't be

67
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,160
the case that the Commission then proposes a law with exactly the same terms or the exactly

68
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,680
the same scope but normally they come up with laws where they pick up these demands and requests

69
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,560
from the European Parliament and transfer this then into a law proposal so it's it's not that this

70
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:17,400
work is not considered by anyone it's it's definitely a useful procedure so to say first of all to

71
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,760
to find already positions in the Parliament and it's also good for the European Commission to

72
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,240
already learn before they start drafting a law what could be potential debates in the Parliament

73
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,480
what could be potential demands so that they can already pick them up in their specific drafts

74
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,320
and if you look at the European Commission's work program and their agenda of the next term

75
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,320
so the next five years it's definitely something they also want to work on so they also talk

76
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:53,000
about sovereignty they also talk about digital infrastructure and they also talk a lot about

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,040
how to protect this how a European answer to this could look like in particular in these changing

78
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:04,600
times and yeah it's to be expected that the European Commission will also propose law on the topic

79
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,320
that the European Parliament works on at the moment so it's it there will be definitely a follow-up

80
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:17,960
I think all right before we dive into the procedure or the report you also mentioned a word

81
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:25,000
little perter and now that this is the person who is active on this but I also guess they're

82
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,240
more than one person could you briefly outline who is behind this any now absolutely so every

83
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,920
report in the European Parliament be it such a own initiative report or be it a report on a

84
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,680
Commission proposal like in the Cyber Resilience Act or in the Copyright Debate so every every

85
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,160
file every report gets a so-called repertoire so this is the responsible person in the European

86
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,480
Parliament leading the debate for the European Parliament until it gets into the plenary and gets

87
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:04,360
a vote so this is basically the person who comes up with a very first draft so basically if it's

88
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,840
a Commission proposal an answer to the Commission proposal so one could say or in this own initiative

89
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,320
report so the very first draft the world sees is written by this repertoire so and then this

90
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,400
repertoire is coming from a specific group so it could be a social democrat it can be a green one

91
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:30,600
it can be a conservative so every group has so so to say the right to send reperters to reports

92
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:37,160
but as that there can be only one repertoire but the other groups also send so-called shadow

93
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:44,920
reperters the shadow reperters are then the leading persons for this file from a specific group so

94
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,600
ultimately what you have you have a leading repertoire coming from a group and then from all the

95
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,320
other groups that are in the European Parliament they send a shadow repertoire so that there's

96
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,760
basically one person from each group working on this file and it's being responsible for this file

97
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,400
so and these are the most important persons if you want to yeah lobby around these documents or

98
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,480
reports and if you want to reach out you normally reach out to the offices of the reperters or shadow

99
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:21,720
reperters because they are the ones guiding with the debate they are coming up with amendments and

100
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,600
negotiate these amendments to come up with so-called compromise amendments they are the ones who

101
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,520
prepare the voting list so they advise how the how the whole group should vote on this and this

102
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,600
is how basically a position is formed in the European Parliament then the committee votes on it

103
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,760
and from the committee it is transferred to the plenary where then all members of the European

104
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,720
Parliament vote on this and to organize this they have these so-called reperters and shadow

105
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,400
reperters who help to find the compromise on the text and to help to find majority so that's

106
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,680
basically their role so this means they're very close to the text they negotiate text they come

107
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,600
up with new ideas they find majority so that's why these are very important roles and positions

108
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:11,160
in this procedure however also other members of the Parliament and members of other groups can

109
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,480
also contribute to these reports by amendments so they can say I want to delete this part I want to

110
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,760
add a new word I want to add a completely new idea and all of these amendments yeah they need

111
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,920
to be discussed they need to be analyzed they need to be streamlined and they need to find

112
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,960
majorities and this is the work of these reperters so you can basically say it's comparable to a

113
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:41,400
share part in other Parliament or assistance in other Parliament that help to come up with a final

114
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,280
text so they have a very important role since they are basically the ones who are thriving a file

115
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:55,160
so one could say so those are the people you talk to when you want to have free software in there

116
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,520
absolutely so I definitely talk to them I also talk to others so as said there are sometimes

117
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,720
also other members who are active in a specific file so you not only have one person working on

118
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,600
digitally topics you have a few and you want to reach out to all of them however the most

119
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:17,720
influential person in a file is normally the rapporteur and so that's why it's so that you should

120
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,200
at least talk to the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs let's say it like this and you might

121
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,880
also want to talk to others who contribute and you see this that they take part in the Parliamentary

122
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,560
debate so they speak up they present their position so this is a way where you learn about their

123
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:40,040
engagement and but also you see this when amendments are tabled so that they are also

124
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,080
other members other than the rapporteurs who table amendments who want to modify the text who

125
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,040
want to improve the text and these are basically normally the people that are involved in the debate

126
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,640
and these are the people you want to talk to until the moment there is a vote when there is a vote

127
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,200
then this is activity for all members and that's a moment where you might want to talk to all

128
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,520
members and tell them vote in this direction vote in that direction because of this and this reason

129
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,800
but until the moment there is a vote you normally talk with this group of people who are we

130
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,360
working on this file and normally do not talk that much with people who are not even in the committee

131
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:23,800
for example all right thank you so much for outlining this now I would say we can dive into the topic

132
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:31,240
directly what's the European technological sovereignty and digital infrastructure any about

133
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:38,440
and yeah who was behind this I mean in in in general one could say the the European Parliament

134
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,760
also like many other actors these days came to the conclusion that we talk a lot about

135
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,080
sovereignty we talk a lot about technological sovereignty also we talk a lot about our infrastructure

136
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:57,000
and the question is like what does it mean so how does this sovereignty should look like so we

137
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,320
have some views and we already presented them quite often on what we do believe what

138
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,840
sovereignty means digital sovereignty but there are also others that have other views on this term

139
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:13,320
so this term is not defined it's very vague and we are using it quite often but we do not really

140
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,520
know what it means and this also means we do not know as European Union and what to do precisely

141
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,960
so we do some piecework here some piecework there we might label as as something towards

142
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,080
sovereignty but if this is really the case we don't know since it's a lot of piecework and there's

143
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:36,520
not really a streamline concept for what is digital sovereignty and how do we achieve it what kind

144
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,600
of actions do we need this does it need slow making does it need funding all of these questions

145
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,600
they are not really addressed by these days however we have many actors who fill this world with

146
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,560
ideas and maybe already activities but nothing is streamlined in particular if you look at the

147
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,800
European Union 27 member states 27 opinions on something so there is definitely the need

148
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,160
to define this term a bit more and also to come up with dedicated actions towards this

149
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:12,840
so and these are questions that always arise when we talk about sovereignty and the European

150
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:20,040
way these days towards digitalization so are there things we need to watch out for in this

151
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:27,480
changing world and what does it mean for us so and in this and as part of this huge debate this

152
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,520
industry committee and that's also important so they come specifically with a few from industry

153
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:38,760
policy so that's why it's in the industry committee right they want to address these questions

154
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,240
this their specific point of view and so they decided as a committee for all groups

155
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,240
proceeding together and they decided we want to give an answer to this question so from our

156
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,600
perspective from the perspective from the industry and research committee we want to tell

157
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,680
as you can parliament and ultimately what our views are on these questions or what does

158
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:09,080
technological sovereignty mean to us what activity needs to be undertaken and and what do we

159
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,000
want to see to achieve this European technological sovereignty but also what do we need to do when we

160
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,880
look at our infrastructure so and it's a pretty planked paper in the beginning since as it's the

161
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,560
own initiative there's nothing where they respond to but where they pretty much fill a plank

162
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:33,880
paper with their ideas and this is organized now we are coming again to the to the procedures and

163
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:40,600
the rapporteurs might so important this is organized by giving to report to one rapporteur

164
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,800
and this rapporteur then writes a draft and based on the draft the other groups and meant to this

165
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:52,120
report so they they say are we this one is missing or this one is over the top we need to change

166
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,000
this and we want to have I don't know improvements here and there and this is then how normally

167
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,040
such a report is formed however since we have new majorities in the European parliament since the

168
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:10,760
last term we also have seen that these procedures are not used as they have been used in last

169
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:17,800
terms since we have this far right majority if the EPP goes with them and that's something yeah

170
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:25,080
we as FSFE here but also I mean members in the parliament try to come up with majorities that

171
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:31,960
are not formed with far right members or extremist members so and the thing is however since they

172
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,960
are elected they also get reports and in this case the rapporteur for this report for this own

173
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:45,560
initiative procedure is a French fascist so and this leads to the problem that's basically

174
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:55,160
from the procedure wise this person it's she's she's called knafos are knafos from the ESN

175
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:03,080
group she presented a report and so now the question from a procedure wise is do we really want to

176
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:10,120
amend to this report basically if we are for example liberal screens or left ones so and that's

177
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,960
I can imagine that would be the normal procedure but nobody wants to do this so what happened is

178
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:23,720
that they let the summer person write a report and then in the meantime the other groups came

179
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,880
together these shadow rapporteurs I was just referring to and the progressive ones came together

180
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:36,360
and thought how can we find a majority without her and how can we still work on the topic since

181
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,840
the topic is important and since the questions that come from from this report are important and

182
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,880
need to be addressed what can we do so and their solution is that they basically came up with

183
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:55,640
amendments that say to every point what summer says delete and proposed new text so what they do

184
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:02,120
basically is to say to whatever she said we want to delete this and we want to replace this with

185
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:08,040
other text so and this needs to be ultimately voted and could let to a situation that ultimately

186
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:15,480
there will be a report which is still under the name of Zara Knafo but that's not a single word

187
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,000
from her still in this report so that could be a solution and then the question is so from a

188
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,960
procedure wise what could happen is that she then says this is far away from what I think and so

189
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:35,640
I will list for my name from the report and then it's an unnamed each report coming from the

190
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,480
each committee with a majority without far right so that's basically the political game what's

191
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:48,280
happening in this specific file we are addressing that also addresses pretty much many topics we

192
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,360
are working on and that's why it's not a very normal procedure so to say so first of all it's

193
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:01,560
this own initiative procedure certainly we have this new majorities so we had a far right member

194
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,400
as a repertoire so in the from the procedure already a lot is different than to

195
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:15,400
normal finds files we worked on in the past and that's why next to content related questions like

196
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,480
that's an Open Source for example play a role in this sovereignty question or not

197
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:27,080
is basically also in the middle of some other questions that are around for example

198
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,280
who is a repertoire for this report and how do we find maturity so and that's something one needs

199
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,320
to know when we talk about this report so it's not just about content here but it's also about

200
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,160
how do we find majorities and will there be on the topics we work on for example the topic of

201
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,680
sovereignty this is a topic where there will be a progressive majority or will there be a far

202
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:55,480
right majority so there are a couple of questions that are not content related but that are really

203
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,720
important for the future of the questions of sovereignty but also on Europe in general I think

204
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:09,640
yeah I can imagine like I now I have to question why was she handed this any why was it passed

205
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:16,200
on to her do you know that by any chance so I mean a set of these are elected members so they

206
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,840
have the same rights than any other group and this also means that workload is distributed

207
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,680
between the members of the parliament so basically they are all equal and I think that's a good

208
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:35,160
thing for a parliament in general but this also means that they yeah if they want to work they

209
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:42,680
are allowed to work so and this also means it can't be that reports are only going always to the

210
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:48,680
big groups because that would mean the majority always get all the reports and that's a bit unfair

211
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,320
also if you look for example to the Greens or the Liberals or smaller groups that also want to have

212
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,600
a saying the back in the days we remember the data protection reform was the repertoire was a

213
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:06,440
green repertoire so it's definitely important and needed that also smaller groups get fired and

214
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:14,840
they do this by betting points so normally it is the case that yeah based on the strengths of a

215
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:22,200
group you you get some points to bet on reports so and by thus you can basically say as a group

216
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,560
I'm particularly interested so for example take the Greens it's very obvious they want to work

217
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:33,320
on topics of environmental questions so they will use a lot of their points to to get reports

218
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:40,040
that are related to their topics they work on I understand topics that are important for the party

219
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:47,240
like they use their points they have to get to get these kind of reports I'm not able to get

220
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,480
every report for themselves exactly so and it's so it's it's to bring some balance and to let

221
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,280
others also the chance to work on topics they are interested in so and in this case the far right

222
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,720
group here sent they want to bet some points and they want to get this report and work on this

223
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,840
topic of solidarity and I also think that something we have seen in other countries for example

224
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:18,280
in the in the hearing in the German Bundestag where there's also the AFD so a far right party that

225
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:25,640
also showed their strong interest in the question of sovereignty, technical sovereignty and they

226
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,120
I mean have a completely different view than us on the topic but they see it as definitely as a

227
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,840
topic they want to work on so and that's something we see in the far right in general they want to

228
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:42,200
work on digital topics and they want to talk about sovereignty and so this makes it slightly

229
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:49,080
difficult for us so to say since they are an important actor since they can bring a majority at

230
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,760
least in the European Parliament and that's something we fear and that's something we should have

231
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,480
on the radar and I do believe we don't want to talk about sovereignty in a nationalism way but

232
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,080
more in a European and global way and this is yeah a fundamental question we are discussing at

233
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,040
the moment and that's why it's so important where my priorities are going and one could also say

234
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,560
this is basically a test one we see here since this is the very first file in the European Parliament

235
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:23,000
where we see a fashion stripper tour it's also happening in our space and there will be law-making

236
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,920
upcoming by the European Commission in this direction and so this file is basically a very

237
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:36,280
important test run in order to see where majorities goes and in these majorities how they value

238
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,240
Open Source for example if we then talk about our topics so I mean worst case is that the

239
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:51,080
fascists come up with proposals for Open Source that are very national-centric while the so-called

240
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,440
progressive majority don't come up with anything on Open Source but they talk about for example

241
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,560
openness or something like this so and this is what I mean so it prints us often in situations

242
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,440
where we have to be very fine tuned in our activities also in our lobby activities and where we have

243
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:14,200
to be very careful whom we support when and why and what this then ultimately means so it's

244
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,680
definitely not a good idea to go for short wins in this term so to say but to have a long term

245
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,200
vision on where to go with whom we want to go and why we want to go there and so this is

246
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:34,200
so to say other than in other files where we could basically say we go with the majority we get

247
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,320
I do believe that in this term it will be definitely different and we have to watch out

248
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:46,920
for majorities very more than we did in the last term all right so thank you so much for the

249
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,880
background and thank you so much for yeah giving us some introduction there how is

250
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,960
Open Source seen in this report because actually I could not find a term at all I mean that's a

251
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:06,360
thing so I mean the knuckle person so the repertoire did not propose anything on Open Source so she

252
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:12,600
seems to not have this on the radar or she seems not to to see Open Source as a enabler for

253
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:19,400
sovereignty however if you then check the amendments there you can see that there are people

254
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:26,040
having Open Source on the radar and that they also want to bring it in this report so but here

255
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:33,080
again we see that there is so to say a slight shift so in the in the past we have already seen

256
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,880
that in particular conservatives and liberals they have a hard time to use the word Open Source

257
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,600
and promoted in a way that it's better than proprietary software for say in easy words

258
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:52,360
so they want to go with terms that don't discriminate towards others one could say

259
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,000
and with this they do believe that giving advantages to Open Source that this would be

260
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,360
unnecessary interference with the market for to say and that's my day I hesitate to come up with

261
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,640
these kinds of sayings so even if you have from the German conservatives for example a strong

262
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,440
statement a party statement where this is going in the direction of public money public codes

263
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:22,360
we don't see this reflected European might so they value Open Source they do believe that Open Source

264
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:29,080
is good however they won't go into the market and give somehow advantages to Open Source by

265
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,880
coming up with sayings like public money public code however they see the benefits so that's

266
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,920
that's something we also need to see so and for example you could also see in the cyber resilience

267
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,360
act so they don't want to harm this market so they came up with exemptions for Open Source so

268
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,960
this is what they do but they they are hesitant in order to they're over promoted so to say

269
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,680
in from from their perspective from their view so and this also means we had also in the past

270
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:04,040
other majorities social democrats decrees also the left ones that are very progressive when

271
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,640
it comes to to our ideas and that mainly follow our ideas on public money public code for example

272
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,480
right and that would they would be happy to to come up with such amendments and proposals

273
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,560
and we have also already seen in the past that these votes goes in this direction but EPP is hesitant

274
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,760
together with them so they abstain or even vote against so but since there are these new

275
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,600
majorities the EPP can decide with whom they go basically they can go with far right majority or

276
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:40,440
they can go with the progressive majority but this also means that they can bring in a lot of pressure

277
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,880
into this progressive group since they can always say if you don't want then we go to another

278
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,480
group where we already have a majority and the progressive part on the other hand don't have

279
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,400
this option so they can't create pressure on the EPP for example and say look if you don't

280
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:03,640
vote with us we find another majority since it is not there anymore so and this gives a very very

281
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:11,400
strong position to the EPP coming up with like a lot of texts that they want and they are the

282
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:17,080
progressive parts of the parliament have to eat it so to say since else they would go to a

283
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:23,000
fascist majority so and that's the that's a piggy point what I what I meant in the beginning

284
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,640
where I said we have to yeah watch out and see where majorities can go so and sometimes it might

285
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:37,240
be the case that we lose Open Source to not have Open Source in a fascist majority all the

286
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,280
other way around right so and this is this is quite difficult and it's challenging however

287
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,720
also from the amendments what we can see is and that's already also something where we can see

288
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:58,120
that the EPP is not only pressuring this progressive majority but also basically talking to them

289
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,440
and and value this input so what the what the EPP does and this so they came up with with a group

290
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,440
of SMD and Liberals so the the Conservatives the Social Democrats and the Liberals together

291
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,960
as a group amended to this report and by thus they also already show that they have a majority

292
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,600
so and they amended in a way that they talk about openness and interoperability and common

293
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,680
standards so what they don't compromise us basically it's about compromises also in words

294
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,440
so it's pretty much compromising in words so I mean if you take openness in the

295
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,040
availability and common standards it's very unlikely that you will achieve this without Open Source

296
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,280
or free software right or open standards it's it's it's it's it's it's nearly impossible I'd say

297
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:51,720
however they are afraid of using the term Open Source the only ones bringing up

298
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:58,040
amendments with the term Open Source are the greens and the left ones so these those groups also

299
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:05,160
precisely added amendments on the term Open Source and and want to be clear on this so to say

300
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,200
and that's a situation where we are so on the one hand we could bend the the terms openness

301
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:18,440
interoperability and common standards to a way that we say that this is basically Open Source

302
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,800
or we nudge them as long as possible that they say it and I do believe that's important that

303
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:30,200
they say it and this is definitely something we do but it could be that the the the EPP

304
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,640
won't take this and this is then also what I meant with the test one right so if this test

305
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:46,520
one we can see how far they go with the wording where the problems with the wording so what could

306
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:53,000
be potential outcomes and majorities and where are so to say red lines for them and this will be

307
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,600
particularly interesting in the in the next weeks to see if the term of Open Source

308
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,840
can find its way in this report because I do believe if we talk about European technological

309
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:13,000
sovereignty we have to talk about Open Source at the same time you see a debate at the moment

310
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:20,200
it's just called by European and this is also something what we fear is that people do not

311
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,640
understand that Open Source is global so and it's good that it's global and there is no European

312
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,920
Open Source or US Open Source or Chinese Open Source but there's only global Open Source

313
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:37,800
and this is also something I think for the next term what we need to explain is sovereignty is

314
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,760
only possible with free software and free software is global and it's good that it's global

315
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,440
so and I think these are the two main pain points so to say in the debate we need to discuss

316
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:54,600
in the next five years and then we need to find majorities and for this precisely this report but

317
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,360
we are discussing now is a very good test run where we can see a lot and then also adapt our

318
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,840
strategies and ideas how we talk to the people how we convince them once we once we bring in some

319
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:14,520
lighting this is a short break for our own cause thank you for listening to the software

320
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,120
podcast working for software freedom and producing podcasts costs money please consider supporting

321
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:33,640
us with a donation on the fsfe.org/donate and then the show notes I see so this is very

322
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,800
interesting to watch over the next weeks will you care when I own this absolutely absolutely and

323
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:46,520
we try to influence it yeah so that's that's also important and I mean I'm sure we will put the

324
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,560
information to the file in the in the show notes so feel free to also reach out to the members

325
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,600
of the parliament so you can see the repertoire and the shadow recorders the amendments are also

326
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:02,200
linked so you can also see who tabled what and you are absolutely free to reach out to them

327
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:09,320
email addresses are easy to find and ask them to add Open Source to the report and to connect the

328
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,240
topic of serenity with the topic of Open Source and be more clearer on the terms of openness in

329
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:22,280
the availability and standards so it needs to be Open Source in the availability and open standards

330
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:28,280
that are compatible with Open Source so I think if we have this then we have a good report

331
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,600
even if you see it's going in the right direction and they understood that inner

332
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,120
availability is key in particular when we talk about European administrations

333
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,360
but the only thing I'm asking myself why don't you then just clearly say in the availability

334
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,880
is only possible with this Open Source because else I mean how should this happen I don't know

335
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,280
that's what I'm asking myself as well I'm like why are they so afraid of the spread but the

336
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,320
important thing is that we reach out to them and tell them that we as people think that this is

337
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:04,360
very important absolutely and as if we will follow this file and also like continue

338
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,160
than the work on this serenity terms so it's really just a starting point for the next five years

339
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:16,040
so we this the topic will also be done about funding about how do we support movements

340
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,680
and this is then also important where the money goes for example right so even if you have this

341
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:26,040
report there will be a way more questions that need to be addressed in the next five years and

342
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:32,120
we will be around and keep you updated in this podcast but also on fsfe.org and other channels
