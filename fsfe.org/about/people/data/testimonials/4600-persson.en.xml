      Code is law, as Lawrence Lessig put it. Therefore Free Software and open
      standards are necessary for human freedom. Our freedom is threatened by
      patents, copy-prevention schemes, locked-down devices and spying. To
      counter these threats I support the FSFE's campaigning for open
      standards, information security and device sovereignty, and against ever
      more onerous copyright laws.
