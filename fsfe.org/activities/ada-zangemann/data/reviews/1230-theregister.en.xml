    "Ada and Zangemann explains the concepts of FOSS to school kidsâ€¦ and managers, marketing people, and victims of Windows-induced Stockholm Syndrome. [...] The book explains this in accessible terms of ice cream flavors, smart skateboards, and speakers which are restricted in what music they play. [...] [I]t gives kids agency: it shows them that they can have control of something and do their own thing."
