<div id="introduction">

    <p><strong>
	In 2021 the Free Software Foundation Europe turned 20. During this time we have empowered users to use, study, share, and improve software. In 20 Years FSFE, we thanked everyone who helped us along the way. 
    </strong></p>

<p>
  <em>
    We would like to take a breath and look back on the road we
    have come, to reflect the milestones we have passed, the
    successes we have achieved, the stories we have written, and the
    moments that brought us together and which we will always
    joyfully remember.
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    But it is not just about the FSFE itself: for our 20th birthday
    we want to give momentum to our pan-European community, the
    community that has formed and always will form the shoulders
    that our movement relies on. <strong>20 Years FSFE is meant to
    be a celebration of everyone who has accompanied us in the past
    or still does.</strong> Thank you for your place in the
    structure of the FSFE today and for setting the foundation
    for the next decades of software freedom to come.

<h3 id="a-birthday-message-from-our-president-matthias-kirschner">A
message to you from our President Matthias Kirschner</h3>

    <p>
        Although technology is ever-changing, our values have been
        consistent throughout the last twenty years. The core of our work
        is, in a nutshell: educating people on the nature of Free Software,
        highlighting its political implications, and simplifying its legal
        preconditions. Matthias Kirschner, President of the FSFE since
        2015, explains this in his own words in a short video.

and interviews</h2>

    <p>
        We contacted people who paved the way of the FSFE since its
        beginning, such as long term volunteers and past staffers. In a series
        of interviews we discuss the progress of the FSFE as well as
        technological topics.

        The FSFE is all about you, the community. For 20 years we have only been able to
        operate thanks to a wide network of people who support us and support
        software freedom. Every person who is involved in the FSFE has unique
        memories, expertise, and hopes for the future. They are all part of the
        story of 20 Years FSFE.

    <p>
        So many things have happened in the last 20 years! Countless hours
        were spent by members of our community to run booths, give talks,
        hold workshops, organise meetings, do lobbying, and more.
        Unfortunately we lack a lot of visuals from these activities! We would
        love to fill up our archive with all the great things you were doing in
        support of our cause!

<h2 id="Highlights-from-the-last-20-years">Highlights from the last 20 years</h2>

  <p>
	In 2021, the FSFE looks back on a successful history with
	major successes in the public, legal, and policy fields. For example
	in 2005, when our intense <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2004q2/000057.html">campaigning</a>
	and collaboration with other organisations persuaded the European
	Parliament to <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2005q3/000109.html">vote</a>
	against Software Patents. Or two years later, when the European
	Court of Justice aligned with the FSFE, <a href="/activities/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.html">requiring
	Microsoft to publish interoperability information</a>. During that
	time, we saw that it was needed to help Free Software developers by
	clarifying the legal aspects of their work, such as the enforcement
	in case of license violations. This led to the FSFE starting to
	work with Free Software legal advocates and practitioners for legal
	initiatives in 2006.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, the FSFE maintains <a href="/activities/ftf/ln.html">the world's
	largest professional network on legal issues related to Free
	Software</a>. The FSFE's legal experts on this network help
	with concrete licensing consultancy. To this end in 2017 we also
	created the highly successful <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> initiative to provide a
	set of recommendations that make licensing Free Software projects
	easier for developers. REUSE has been adopted by well known
	projects such as the German Corona Warn App and the KDE.
  </p>

  <p>
	Since its founding, the FSFE has been committed to running public
	campaigns and helping people to understand the benefits of Free
	Software. As early as 2012, we helped users to overcome software
	restrictions in their phones with the launch of our <a href="/activities/android/">'Free Your
	Android' campaign</a>. Two years earlier we introduced <a href="/activities/ilovefs/index.html">"I
	love Free Software day"</a> which is celebrated around the
	globe every year on 14 February. In 2017, we launched the
	extraordinarily successful <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">'Public Money? Public Code!'
	campaign</a>, convincing several public administrations to change
	their IT strategy. The accompanying  <a href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">open letter</a> has been signed
	by over 200 civil society organisations, 31.000 individuals, and
	several public administrations like the city of Barcelona and the
	Swedish JobTech Development center.
   </p>

   <p>
	Of course, all these accomplishments can only give a glimpse of the
	impact of the FSFE and our activities in the last 20 years. All
	these successes are the result of our large community that we can
	rely on.
