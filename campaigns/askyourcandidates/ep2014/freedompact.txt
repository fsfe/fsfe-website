Freedom Pact


Considering that:
Access to software determines who may participate in a society where most interactions rely on digital technologies;

Free Software, which everyone may use, study, share and improve, enables political, economic, and cultural participation for everyone;

The use of Open StandardsÂ¹ is critical to achieve interoperability between different IT systems in Europe, and ensure the long-term accessibility of information; 

Software patents are incompatible with Free Software and are a menace to society and economy, because they restrict innovation, damage businesses and put collaborative creativity in great danger;

Free Software helps to boost European economy by enabling small and medium sized companies to compete on a local and regional level against existing  software monopolies;

Free Software is essential for public bodies to break free from vendor lock-in, obtain value for money, and promote the growth of European businesses;



I pledge to:
promote the use of Free Software in all areas of public life, in particular in the educational sector, so that students can learn in freedom

promote legislation to make Free Software the first choice in public procurement throughout Europe 

promote policies in favour of Free Software and oppose policies that discriminate against it.

promote the widest possible use of Open Standards1 in the public sector, as well as the publication and archiving of all public data and documents in formats based on Open Standards

ensure that all software developed with public funds is released as Free Software, so other administrations and the public can benefit from it

strengthen consumers' rights so as to promote users control over their own devices and oppose any measures endangering it

oppose any provision that aims at establishing software patents in Europe and work to end the European Patent Office's practice of granting patents on computer-implemented inventions
