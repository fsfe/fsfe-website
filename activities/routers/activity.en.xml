    <title>Router Freedom</title>
    <description>
      It should go without saying that in our society we should be able
      to freely choose technical devices for use in our homes. But some
      Internet service providers in Europe dishonor this principle by
      dictating which device their customers have to use in order to
      connect to the internet, or they discriminate against the owners
      of alternative devices. This undermining of our basic freedom of
      choice is strongly opposed by the FSFE and many other
      organisations, projects, and individuals. Router Freedom is not
      merely a topic for experts. It affects all of us.
