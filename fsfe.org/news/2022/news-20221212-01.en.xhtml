<p>
  Copyleft ensures that Free Software remains Free. Stockfish filed a 
  lawsuit when ChessBase distributed parts of Stockfish work under a 
  proprietary license, violating GNU GPL obligations. Checkmate! 
  Copyleft won. Stockfish secured numerous concessions from ChessBase 
  to respect the GPL.

<p>
  Stockfish is is a Free Software chess engine licensed under the GNU 
  General Public License version 3 (GPL-3.0). It was created in 2004 
  and, through its strong community support, is now the strongest chess 
  engine available to the public. ChessBase is a German software 
  company that develops and sells proprietary chess software.
</p>

<p>
  In 2021, Stockfish filed a lawsuit against ChessBase GmbH, alleging 
  that ChessBase had distributed to customers software products under 
  proprietary licenses despite them being derivative works of 
  Stockfish. The most notable derivatives were the Fat Fritz 2 and 
  Houdini 6 software distributed by ChessBase. By doing so, Stockfish 
  alleged that ChessBase has violated central obligations of the 
  GPL-3.0, which ensures that users of the software are informed of 
  their rights. Despite leading developers with Stockfish terminating 
  their licensing of Stockfish to ChessBase, ChessBase continued to 
  distribute a number of Stockfish derivatives.
</p>

<p>
  This suit is notable as it is among the first of its type to involve 
  a permanent termination of a Free Software license to a specific 
  party. Additionally, Stockfish did not seek damages or other forms of 
  financial compensation in their lawsuit, but rather pressed the court 
  only for judicial actions that would result in the enforcement of the 
  GPL-3.0.

<p>
  Having a <a href="/freesoftware/legal/faq.html#copyleft">copyleft 
  license</a> means that the derivative and/or combined work has to be 
  licensed under the same license as the original work. As a result, 
  this ensures that a copylefted piece of Free Software can remain 
  free, and it is difficult to transform it into proprietary software.

  On 7 November 2022, a settlement was reached between Tord Romstad and 
  Stéphane Nicolet (leading developers of Stockfish), and ChessBase in 
  the District Court of Munich I (Case No. 42 0 9765/21). Under this 
  settlement, ChessBase will no longer be able to distribute Stockfish 
  for a year, whether in its original or modified form. Nevertheless, 
  licensing of the rights to Stockfish under the GPL v3 to ChessBase 
  will resume after this year, provided that distribution of Stockfish 
  or its derivatives in this time must comply fully with the license 
  conditions of the GPL-3.0, which includes informing all its users 
  that their use of Stockfish in their products will be subject to the 
  GPL-3.0. To this end, ChessBase can seek certification from the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>, a 
  non-profit organization based in New York that works for software 
  freedom, that their software is in compliance with the GPL-3.0.
</p>

<p>
  To prevent any future violations, ChessBase will also create the 
  position of a Free Software Compliance Officer and maintain a domain 
  (foss.chessbase.com) that lists any of their products that contain 
  Free Software.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, in case of future violations ChessBase is required to 
  pay a contractual penalty to the FSFE for each breach of Stockfish’s 
  initial request for ChessBase to cease its violations of the GPL-3.0. 
  Under the terms of the settlement, this amount will be determined at 
  Stockfish’s discretion.
</p>

<p>
  It is heartening to see the enforcement in this settlement of the 
  GPL-3.0 and copyleft principles, and we hope that this contributes to 
  a climate where the freedoms of Free Software are respected by 
  businesses and upheld by the courts. We thank the developers behind 
  Stockfish for their great work and for sticking to the Community 
  Enforcement principles
