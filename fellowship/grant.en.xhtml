      <p>
        The Fellowship grant was a way for people involved in Free Software
        activism to become Fellows, even if they could not afford the Fellowship
        donation. Since now all volunteers can join the Fellowship without the
        need of any payment, it has become obsolete.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      There are <a href="contribute/contribute.en.html">various ways</a> of
      contributing to FSFE, where financial support is only one of the options.
      No matter in which way you choose to get involved in FSFE â€“ you are
      welcome to the Fellowship!
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are involved in any volunteer activity within FSFE, please get in
      contact with the
      <a href="about/team.en.html">coordinator of your group</a>, who will give
      you instructions how to join the Fellowship.
