00:00.000 --> 00:18.080
Hello and welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:18.080 --> 00:22.000
This podcast is brought to you by the free Software Foundation Europe.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.240
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:26.240 --> 00:31.040
I'm Bonnie Merring and our guest for today's episode is Johannes Näder.

00:31.040 --> 00:34.240
Johannes has joined the FSFE Starfighters last year

00:34.240 --> 00:38.880
and since then he has become a valued and esteemed colleague.

00:38.880 --> 00:42.000
He is the FSFE's German team coordinator

00:42.000 --> 00:46.560
and also the person responsible for the Public Money Public Code Initiative.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.840
If you have not yet supported or heard of this initiative,

00:49.840 --> 00:53.600
this is the perfect episode for you to learn all about it.

00:53.600 --> 00:57.200
Hello and welcome Johannes, thank you so much for joining me today.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.320
Hi Bonnie and thanks for inviting me.

01:00.320 --> 01:05.840
I'm really excited to learn all about your connection with free software.

01:05.840 --> 01:10.960
You have known about free software before you started working for the free Software Foundation Europe.

01:10.960 --> 01:14.880
But how did you get to know and love free software?

01:14.880 --> 01:19.360
I think yes, my first contact with free software was in the late 1990s

01:19.360 --> 01:24.000
a long time ago when I installed Sousa 6 with a friend.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.560
And I remember hours of excitement typing commands on his computer

01:28.560 --> 01:31.440
until we finally managed to boot into the graphical system.

01:32.240 --> 01:36.000
At the time, although I didn't know about the four freedoms,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.640
I remember feeling like I was owning a computer for the first time released

01:40.640 --> 01:45.040
something I never experienced with the proprietary software I had used before.

01:45.040 --> 01:48.240
So I think this was the first contact with free software for me.

01:49.120 --> 01:52.160
But in the following years, I learned more about free software concepts

01:52.160 --> 01:57.200
and I switched to using Linux, excited not only by how it empowered me to use computers,

01:57.840 --> 02:03.200
but also by how it could help society remain free and collaborative in digital age.

02:05.280 --> 02:09.200
I've been involved in free software policy work since 2010

02:09.200 --> 02:14.480
and today, second, November, it has been one year since I joined the free software

02:14.480 --> 02:16.480
foundation Europe as policy project manager.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.200
Oh my god, that's quite a journey for you.

02:23.200 --> 02:27.600
Like it's 1990s, so it's 30 years?

02:28.400 --> 02:29.680
No, let's say 25.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.640
Oh my god.

02:34.640 --> 02:35.680
Yeah, a long time.

02:36.480 --> 02:40.880
And you have a free software, have you ever had a feeling of regret

02:41.680 --> 02:46.000
where you're always excited and had the feeling, oh my god, yes, I'm the person in charge.

02:47.760 --> 02:51.200
I really stick to free software and for my private use,

02:51.200 --> 02:57.280
absolutely during my last job, I had to use some proprietary systems and software

02:57.280 --> 03:04.720
and I really felt like, oh, I didn't really think I ever had to go back to this.

03:04.720 --> 03:08.720
So, but now with the free software foundation Europe, that's of,

03:10.160 --> 03:11.600
yeah, good again.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.560
Awesome, I'm really glad to hear that.

03:16.320 --> 03:21.520
Also, you have worked for, or you have loved free software, let's say, like that for a long time.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.040
You recently started your work with the FSFE.

03:25.920 --> 03:30.720
So, in this time, you have mainly worked on the public money, public code initiative.

03:31.520 --> 03:37.600
Can you tell me a bit about what's this initiative, all about what's so important for you

03:37.600 --> 03:40.640
in this initiative? And yeah, just give me a quick introduction.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.880
Yeah, sure, tell me if it's too long, try to keep it quick.

03:45.760 --> 03:50.320
Yeah, so we have this very simple claim for our public money, public code initiative.

03:51.280 --> 03:56.560
We want legislation requiring that publicly finance software developed for the public sector,

03:56.560 --> 04:01.200
be made publicly available under free and open source software license.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.600
If it is public money, it should be public code as well.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.720
Code paid by the people should be available to the people, as simple as that.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.640
So, why are we demanding this?

04:11.280 --> 04:14.880
The free software foundation Europe has been around for over 20 years now,

04:14.880 --> 04:19.600
and since the beginning, we have been trying to convince public bodies to use and procure

04:19.600 --> 04:26.000
free software. There is a useful political lever here and public institutions are among

04:26.000 --> 04:31.520
the biggest buyers of IT technology. I think up to 27% of software companies' revenues

04:31.520 --> 04:37.520
from public administrations and institutions. So, at some point, we realized that we needed a

04:37.520 --> 04:42.960
dedicated initiative for this. And that's why we came up, I think, six years ago with the idea

04:42.960 --> 04:49.040
of public money, public code. This framework gives us the opportunity to get in touch directly

04:49.040 --> 04:54.640
with decision makers, but also people from the administrations and explain to them why they

04:54.640 --> 04:58.000
should use free software and how they can move in this direction.

04:58.720 --> 05:04.320
So, public money, public code targets the whole of Europe, all political and all administrative

05:04.320 --> 05:09.280
levels. And we deliberately speak of an initiative or framework, not a campaign,

05:09.280 --> 05:13.840
because pressure from the street is certainly not the means of choice in this kind of political

05:13.840 --> 05:20.160
work. One big success of public money public code is that we have made the topics of free software

05:20.240 --> 05:26.480
and public code accessible to parties from the entire political spectrum. So, it's kind of

05:26.480 --> 05:32.400
depoliticized in the sense of it doesn't belong only to one part of the political spectrum,

05:32.400 --> 05:39.200
it is opposed by the other parties. So, what do we do with this framework? This is really what

05:39.200 --> 05:45.280
you were asking about. We have this catchy and successful slogan, which is very good to explain

05:45.440 --> 05:51.200
what we want to achieve. And it's here everywhere, like everybody keeps saying public money,

05:51.200 --> 05:57.200
public code. Yeah, it has really become widely known during the last years, which is good.

05:58.800 --> 06:05.520
We have a special brochure for public money public code, which we have developed for politicians

06:05.520 --> 06:11.360
and administrations. It contains best practices, experiences, success stories of other institutions

06:11.760 --> 06:17.280
and administrations. There are definitions, arguments, information on the economic relevance of

06:17.280 --> 06:22.240
free software and procurement also. I think it's a great tool to get started with the topic and

06:22.240 --> 06:29.280
to convince people. It can be downloaded from our website, fsfe.org, and you can audit as well

06:29.280 --> 06:35.040
as a printed version free of charge. By the way, the brochure is by now some years old already,

06:35.040 --> 06:40.400
and we plan to publish a new version with new best practices in some time next year,

06:40.400 --> 06:48.560
probably mid 2024. What else do we have there? It's of course our open letter, which currently more

06:48.560 --> 06:55.840
than 36,000 individual signatories, and more than 200 organizations have decided to sign the open

06:55.840 --> 07:00.800
letter also, including several administrations that have committed themselves to public money

07:00.800 --> 07:08.560
public code. For example, there's this Norwegian labor and welfare administration, they account up for

07:09.280 --> 07:18.720
one third of the Norwegian state budget. We have as well big as small administrations

07:19.680 --> 07:24.960
committed to public money public code by signing the open letter. We have an explanatory video

07:24.960 --> 07:32.160
in many languages. You can find it as well on fsfe.org or media.fsfe.org, as well as

07:32.320 --> 07:37.760
campaigning material. We have dedicated mailing lists for stakeholders from German municipalities,

07:39.200 --> 07:45.920
and of course our website publiccode.eu, which is landing page and information page about the whole

07:45.920 --> 07:51.760
initiative. And with this initiative, we also want to be kind of a hub for the community for

07:51.760 --> 07:57.760
stakeholders and for public administrations, enabling them to connect and to learn from each other

07:57.840 --> 08:04.720
and see how they can benefit from the experiences made in other administrations. So more. Yeah, short

08:04.720 --> 08:10.400
introduction. To what it is about in all the campaign material, that's quite a lot.

08:11.760 --> 08:18.240
And it has grown. I have to feeling like it's become one of the most well-known initiatives

08:18.240 --> 08:26.240
by the fsfe. Yes, definitely. So I think as you already said, the slogan public money public code is

08:28.240 --> 08:33.920
widely known by now. Many administrations not only in our fsfe.org bubble. Let's put it like that,

08:33.920 --> 08:44.000
but also in the whole administration digitization scene. So if you come up with public money public

08:44.000 --> 08:52.720
code, at least most people get an idea of what you're focusing on and what you're talking about,

08:52.720 --> 08:59.600
and you can start explaining more about this then. Why do you think it's such an important initiative?

09:02.240 --> 09:07.520
Well, for administrations, we think it's very important to opt for using free software instead

09:07.520 --> 09:13.840
of proprietary software. And there are several reasons for this. First proprietary software comes

09:13.840 --> 09:19.120
with a vendor login, whereas free software and open standards enable interoperability across

09:19.120 --> 09:25.200
institutions, across systems, and across versions. So this is the prerequisite for independence,

09:25.200 --> 09:32.480
and I think the cornerstone also for digital sovereignty, which is a term which has been

09:32.480 --> 09:37.920
discussed a lot during the last years. Second, free software enables collaboration. So public

09:37.920 --> 09:41.840
administrations can work together and tender or develop software tailored to the needs.

09:42.720 --> 09:48.720
This kind of collaboration may still be new to many public administrations, especially when it comes

09:48.720 --> 09:54.160
to code development. However, as the benefits of free software become more widely known,

09:54.160 --> 09:59.040
more and more administrations also want to collaborate and learn from how others have done it.

10:00.640 --> 10:07.120
Third free software supports sustainability, because once these effects are just described and

10:07.120 --> 10:13.200
the one for all principle have taken full effect, administrations no longer have to constantly reinvent

10:14.160 --> 10:19.680
especially in local administrations, similar processes and services exist in many different places.

10:20.400 --> 10:26.720
If you, for example, think about dock licensing or something like that, which is really a service

10:26.720 --> 10:35.600
that is needed in practically every municipality, every community in all countries. So it's the same

10:35.600 --> 10:41.040
all over the world. Why do administrations all over the world buy licenses for this of proprietary

10:41.040 --> 10:45.280
software products? Why don't they work together and make sure they have a tool that really needs

10:45.280 --> 10:53.120
their needs? One more point, the long run free software will save money. If you think about how much

10:53.120 --> 10:59.280
money administrations spend on proprietary licenses, if they just invest that money into free software,

10:59.280 --> 11:08.160
tax money would be saved and used more efficiently. And by these administrations and public

11:08.160 --> 11:13.680
administrations can also strengthen local partners from the local economy, especially small and

11:13.680 --> 11:20.400
medium enterprises, which might or will probably lead to more innovation by opening up this very

11:20.400 --> 11:27.520
close market that we have now with the proprietary software market to new competitors. And finally,

11:27.520 --> 11:34.000
free software is transparent by default. So the code is verifiable by independent third parties

11:34.000 --> 11:38.400
and security vulnerabilities are more likely to be found and can be fixed immediately,

11:39.200 --> 11:45.840
which, as we know, also leads to a higher acceptance of the whole digitalization of administrative

11:45.840 --> 11:53.440
services by the citizens. I think these are really good reasons for administrations to think of

11:53.440 --> 11:58.000
moving in the direction of free software and think of implementing public money, public code.

11:58.000 --> 12:09.040
How and why do you think it has a wider acceptance with the public or the civil society

12:09.040 --> 12:16.880
if public institutions would use free software? Yes, so I think for for myself and I think also for

12:16.880 --> 12:24.240
many citizens, if I want to use a digital service, especially new digital service, where

12:24.240 --> 12:31.920
switch from analog filling out forms to using my computer to ordering something or

12:34.080 --> 12:39.440
with an administration, then I really want to make sure that the program does what it should do

12:39.440 --> 12:46.800
and doesn't do anything else that my data is being handled carefully and doesn't end up maybe on

12:46.800 --> 12:57.840
a server somewhere out our own jurisdiction, which is very important. So I think we also know

12:57.840 --> 13:05.840
from studies during the corona pandemics that if people see that the software they are using for

13:05.840 --> 13:16.320
these digital services is transparent, they will rather take a step forward to choosing to really

13:16.320 --> 13:22.320
use them. And to also trust that the data is handled carefully and don't just link to some

13:22.320 --> 13:28.240
large companies who then sell it for profit. This comes additionally, yes, absolutely.

13:29.520 --> 13:36.800
How can institutions support public money, public code? So like if there is a public institution

13:36.800 --> 13:45.040
out there that says, oh yeah, I know it's important that we stick to the data laws that we protect

13:45.040 --> 13:52.800
that of civilians that we also do not waste the taxpayers' money on millions and millions of licenses

13:52.800 --> 13:59.120
for proprietary software. And how can those institutions support public money, public code?

13:59.120 --> 14:05.200
Because they obviously can't just change the whole infrastructure. And we have talked about this

14:05.200 --> 14:10.880
for a long time. We have said, you don't need to change everything overnight. It's a policy

14:11.680 --> 14:21.760
decision. How can they support? So what we have in mind with public money, public code is a

14:21.760 --> 14:28.800
continuous long-term process towards free software rather than this big bang migrations that we already

14:28.800 --> 14:35.840
have seen failed in the past, which are really complex. And often I've seen as lighthouse projects.

14:36.080 --> 14:40.640
So if they fail, the public tends to blame free software for that failure. Also, it's not good for

14:40.640 --> 14:46.880
their administrations. So public money, public code, therefore, more aims for incremental movement

14:46.880 --> 14:53.760
towards free software. Yeah, and you were asking, how can they take the first steps if they really

14:53.760 --> 14:59.360
want to do that? So of course, they can start learning more about free software, public code,

14:59.360 --> 15:04.720
and about the benefits that it brings to their work and to society. I think our brochure,

15:04.720 --> 15:08.960
I already mentioned it with best practices and how to use a good introduction, a good first step.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.800
And as I also said for interested stakeholders from German municipalities, only Germany, sorry,

15:14.800 --> 15:20.400
at this point, we have a mailing list for exchange and seeking synergies registering.

15:20.400 --> 15:25.360
It's really easy. So maybe we can also put the link in the show notes. Yes.

15:26.960 --> 15:31.520
Yes. And we like to encourage administrations,

15:31.520 --> 15:37.280
willing to move into this direction instead of doing this kind of big bang migrations,

15:37.840 --> 15:42.880
rather start putting their own developments in the free software licenses and design tenders

15:42.880 --> 15:48.960
and procurement procedures to ensure that public code is created. And of course, we welcome all

15:48.960 --> 15:53.600
administrations committed to public money, public code to sign our open letter, calling for public

15:53.600 --> 15:58.560
code legislation as explained above. And I think we will also put this link in the show notes.

15:59.200 --> 16:06.400
Yes. Does signing the open letter has any immediate consequences or is it more taking a stand

16:06.400 --> 16:12.720
and saying, Hey, I'm in favor of this and showing also like the parliamentarians,

16:12.720 --> 16:18.880
oh, I would really like us as public institutions to follow those rules and to

16:19.600 --> 16:25.440
implement free software. Please help us with laws and guide us in this direction.

16:26.160 --> 16:33.760
It's I would say it's both of course. Yes. We want to give visibility to these administrations

16:33.760 --> 16:38.880
and public institutions that decide to support public money, public code. So we are adding

16:38.880 --> 16:44.320
the new signatories to our PMPC website, so public money, public code website. Sorry if I

16:44.320 --> 16:50.240
accidentally stick to PMPC, which is our abbreviation for it, which we also use it internally.

16:50.800 --> 16:57.360
So we are adding the new signatories to public code.eu. And with some of them, if they agree,

16:57.360 --> 17:02.480
we conduct interviews to be published also on our website and social media channels as best

17:02.480 --> 17:06.960
practice examples. And some of these examples can also be found in the public money, public code

17:06.960 --> 17:11.920
pressure. We believe that the more institutions commit themselves publicly to free software,

17:11.920 --> 17:18.000
the easier it will be for others to follow suit and do the same. So it's really something that

17:18.560 --> 17:25.440
does have effect for the administrations in the sense that we want to show that they are supporting

17:26.400 --> 17:35.840
this call, this initiative. How do you like contact public institutions or do the public

17:35.840 --> 17:42.080
institutions or public bodies find the open letter by themselves? And if you contact them,

17:42.640 --> 17:49.440
how do they react? Yes, again, also here, both happens. So there are administrations that

17:49.440 --> 17:55.600
are public institutions that contact us and say, hey, we like your idea of public money, public

17:55.600 --> 18:02.960
code. And we would like to be part of that. So how can we do that? But we also reach out to

18:03.600 --> 18:09.760
public administrations across Europe. And there we try to target administrations that already

18:09.760 --> 18:16.240
have some ties to free software or where we see potential. So we get all kinds of reactions.

18:16.240 --> 18:21.200
We see we can see that many administrations are curious about this idea of public money, public

18:21.200 --> 18:26.480
code. And this often leads to video call where we get to know each other, where we can talk about

18:26.480 --> 18:32.160
the concepts and benefits of public code. We can find out what their current situation is,

18:32.160 --> 18:38.160
where they are, if they already know a lot or at the very beginning, we can answer their

18:38.160 --> 18:42.880
questions and address their fears and reservations if there are any. And often there are some

18:44.240 --> 18:50.240
fears and reservations. So sometimes, of course, we also find that we are preaching to the choir

18:50.240 --> 18:55.360
and don't need to convince them to sign the open letter because they do it deliberately.

18:56.560 --> 19:00.800
However, we also see that many institutions are more interesting in learning about the topic

19:00.800 --> 19:05.920
and exchanging ideas with other institutions. So we can provide them with contacts or if they

19:05.920 --> 19:11.280
are from Germany, invite them to this mailing list I've been talking about. So these kinds of

19:11.280 --> 19:17.440
conversations are really valuable to us as well. And even if they ultimately decide not to sign the

19:17.440 --> 19:23.920
letter for now, not to commit publicly to public money, public code for now, they get the chance

19:23.920 --> 19:27.920
to learn about free software and they may be more open to the idea in the future.

19:28.080 --> 19:41.280
So those were the aims or those were the approaches that you focused on in the past. Now I hear they

19:41.280 --> 19:52.160
have been some changes in the strategy as well. Those changes, can you explain them a bit to me and

19:53.120 --> 20:03.120
yeah, let me know why there have been those changes in the strategy or especially in our work

20:03.120 --> 20:10.720
on public money, public code. Yes, public money, public code initiative has now been running for

20:10.720 --> 20:16.480
more than six years and we see more and more free software strategies and announcements and

20:16.560 --> 20:24.800
politics and administrations to move towards public code. That's paper doesn't blush. We are

20:27.040 --> 20:34.160
we are often, yes, if you see what's happening actually, we often are missing concrete progress and

20:34.160 --> 20:38.160
this is a decisive implementation of free software friendly papers and legislations.

20:38.880 --> 20:43.520
Also, many of these papers contain loopholes. For example, if you take the European Commission's

20:43.520 --> 20:50.160
free software strategy, it allows a nose citation to choose non-open technologies where

20:50.160 --> 20:55.680
there are good reasons to do so and to publish software under free software license only wherever

20:55.680 --> 21:03.200
it makes sense to do so. So what are these reasons and when does something make sense, this really

21:03.200 --> 21:08.480
remains undefined and this is a loophole that really allows at any point to step back and say,

21:08.560 --> 21:13.200
oh no, this time we rather use proprietary products instead of opting for free software.

21:13.920 --> 21:19.280
Also, what we see is that clear targets and indicators are often missing. More than good

21:19.280 --> 21:24.400
intentions, we need statistics on the actual development, on procurement and on the use of

21:24.400 --> 21:29.360
free software and public administrations because we want to see if there is any progress and at the

21:29.360 --> 21:37.040
moment we don't have these statistics so it's hard for us to judge. This is why we during the last

21:37.040 --> 21:42.800
year have decided to shift the focus of the PMPC or public money public code framework a bit.

21:43.440 --> 21:47.280
We still want to encourage decision makers and administrations to move into this direction,

21:47.920 --> 21:53.040
to move into the direction of free software, but at the same time we want to take a watchdog role

21:53.040 --> 22:01.520
where we see problematic developments. Okay, so this is called PMPC watchdog, right?

22:02.320 --> 22:12.400
Right. Do you then check out all the strategy papers or how does this work? Could you explain

22:12.400 --> 22:19.600
there's a bit more to me like how I now totally understand why it's needed as you already said,

22:19.600 --> 22:25.680
people tend to write a lot, but just don't mean that they really do that.

22:26.320 --> 22:33.520
Yes, let me first say that steps in the right direction are always good and even if they are slow

22:33.520 --> 22:39.040
and even if we sometimes wish for more and faster progress we want to support and help and give

22:39.040 --> 22:43.920
advice and encourage and connect people to work together towards public code and administrations.

22:45.440 --> 22:50.720
But why have we chosen this to take this or to focus on this watchdog part

22:51.680 --> 22:59.680
is that we think we have reached a critical moment for free software. Some years ago free software

22:59.680 --> 23:08.400
and digital sovereignty were always mentioned in the same breath just yeah so it was clear to everybody

23:08.400 --> 23:13.440
that digital sovereignty for public administrations could only be reached with free software.

23:13.440 --> 23:18.960
Now increasingly many argue that digital sovereignty can also be guaranteed with proprietary software

23:18.960 --> 23:23.680
if only the servers are located in Europe or in Germany or any other country in Europe.

23:23.680 --> 23:29.440
So this leaves the concept of digital sovereignty far behind its potential and another problem arises

23:30.080 --> 23:36.240
when the terms free and open are used inflationarily for software that is not actually free software.

23:36.240 --> 23:41.680
So when projects call themselves free software or open source although the four freedoms are not

23:41.680 --> 23:48.000
granted and not even the source code is available this is very problematic and it can harm public

23:48.000 --> 23:55.360
money public code and it can harm free software. This is why we want to go in this direction by

23:55.360 --> 24:00.960
identifying and naming such undesirable developments and hopefully preventing them.

24:02.480 --> 24:10.080
And you are asking about how we are actually doing this so if you want I could give you

24:10.800 --> 24:19.280
one or two examples from our current work. So these are both from Germany which I apologize for

24:19.280 --> 24:24.880
the reason is that I've been mainly working with a focus on Germany during the last year.

24:27.040 --> 24:33.200
But yes so the first one is the German governmental parties have in their

24:33.200 --> 24:38.800
coalition contract announced to come up with legislation in favor of public money public code.

24:38.800 --> 24:44.240
This was two years ago and the coalition has failed to live up to this promise until now.

24:44.960 --> 24:50.800
Even worse the federal government until now continues to rely on proprietary software.

24:51.520 --> 24:59.280
In the 2024 budget for example 3.8 billion of euros are marked for the proprietary oracle cloud

25:00.240 --> 25:07.600
why the at the same time they're already far too small funds for digital sovereignty and by this

25:07.600 --> 25:15.520
also for free software are to be cut by almost by half in the new budget so from they had been

25:16.640 --> 25:23.680
48 million compared to these 3.8 billion euros for oracle and now they're even cut.

25:24.640 --> 25:30.160
What we did here is we formed a broad alliance of civil society and the free software industry

25:30.160 --> 25:35.120
and we publicly criticized the German government and called it to implement the promised free

25:35.120 --> 25:42.720
software friendly policy and also to provide the necessary funds before the current legislative

25:43.200 --> 25:52.080
period is over so it's time now to act and we yeah we call the government to action here before

25:52.080 --> 26:00.080
it's too late and one other example with a bit different perspective for what watchdog means

26:01.840 --> 26:08.800
we have in Germany a situation where some politicians and decision makers have identified the

26:08.800 --> 26:15.920
need of a sovereign workspace for the public sector so this means a digitally sovereign office

26:15.920 --> 26:21.840
and collaboration suits including documents storage email calendar chat online meeting rooms

26:21.840 --> 26:26.480
so everything that people and administrations need for the daily work for the daily computer work

26:27.440 --> 26:33.200
and for long the most advanced approach to this was the so-called Definix suite

26:34.000 --> 26:41.440
Definix suite developed by the public IT service provider data port. Definix contains numerous

26:41.440 --> 26:46.560
free software components and is advertised as open source based on open source and also digitally

26:46.560 --> 26:52.160
sovereign and this gives the false impression that Definix suite is free software. Data port

26:52.960 --> 26:58.400
has really not yet released the source code for its workspace suit despite being repeatedly

26:58.400 --> 27:05.840
asked to do so by eligible parties. Data port also had an interest in transparent relationship

27:05.840 --> 27:10.080
with a with a similar project run by the center for digital sovereignty at the German

27:10.080 --> 27:16.560
Federal Ministry of the Interior which is called open desk and when being asked for its source code

27:16.560 --> 27:22.000
for the Definix source code data port officials usually refer to open desk where until the summer

27:22.000 --> 27:29.440
new code was also available either um yeah and after we were not successful in obtaining the source

27:29.440 --> 27:35.440
code of Definix from data port we decided to tackle this by sending a catalog of questions to the

27:35.440 --> 27:41.680
German Ministry asking about ties between both projects about funding and about their plans to

27:41.680 --> 27:46.640
publish the source code under free software license and how their current policy of not having

27:46.640 --> 27:52.640
published it complies to the plans of um yeah of the German government to move towards public

27:52.640 --> 27:59.440
money public code. We published this question catalog and we also published the answers on fsfe.org

27:59.440 --> 28:04.320
pointing out some promising steps in the right direction on in the right direction on the

28:04.320 --> 28:11.760
side of open desk but we also clarified that Definix is currently not free software and we demanded

28:11.760 --> 28:16.880
that they should either release the code under free software license or step away from claiming to

28:16.880 --> 28:24.320
be free software. So this is something that that we did during during the summer by now we see

28:24.320 --> 28:30.640
that open desk has since already I think end of June or July has published its source code so as I

28:30.640 --> 28:40.160
said there are some hopeful movements on this part and at the same time with data port and this

28:40.160 --> 28:47.760
Definix yeah what they did is they are not using the terms open source for themselves anymore

28:48.720 --> 28:58.960
so they don't claim to be free software anymore which is not what we would wish to it would be

28:58.960 --> 29:05.200
better if they it would just put the whole Definix suite under an open under free software license

29:06.480 --> 29:15.760
but if they are not willing to do that it's better they yeah they admit not to be free software

29:15.760 --> 29:25.600
than claiming to be yes and at the same time so while doing all this we we always try to keep

29:26.480 --> 29:31.120
discussion channels open so we remain open to discuss these issues with all stakeholders we try to

29:31.120 --> 29:35.760
find out if and how the situation can be improved and how we can help them with this this is also

29:35.760 --> 29:43.360
very important to us so it's not trying to suddenly start opposing administrations

29:45.520 --> 29:52.400
but try to keep in contact and try to see where we can help and how we can improve the situation.

29:52.880 --> 30:01.280
so there are kind of like two strategies currently there is the one of our people to start with

30:01.280 --> 30:09.360
public money public code and then there is the one that also tries to keep the name sticking to

30:09.360 --> 30:16.880
the basis of the or to the aims of the initiative so that public money public code as it has become

30:16.880 --> 30:26.320
a widely known slogan also still means public administrations should use public money for public code

30:27.280 --> 30:37.440
yes and it's also about helping and yeah guiding institutions in this direction or

30:37.680 --> 30:48.480
yes definitely it's it's both what you said so we want to encourage and we want to

30:48.480 --> 30:57.120
a bit guard the yeah at the same time take care that yeah that the terms free software and public

30:57.120 --> 31:05.120
money public code and digital sovereignty are not watered down so this is very important and

31:05.200 --> 31:10.240
because if we allow projects to decorate themselves with the terms up source of free software

31:10.240 --> 31:16.240
but do something completely different then this is bad for taxpayers for digital sovereignty for

31:16.240 --> 31:26.640
innovation and for society as a whole so I think maybe a catchy summary of what we want to achieve

31:26.640 --> 31:33.520
with this new watchdog focus is could be thank you for the thank you for the fine words now please

31:33.520 --> 31:39.920
let the did speak so we want public money public code to become reality across Europe not only

31:39.920 --> 31:45.440
fine words for this we really need progress we really need implementation of existing policies

31:45.440 --> 31:51.040
and papers we need statistics and of course we also need to speak up if something is going

31:51.680 --> 31:59.120
into the wrong direction totally wrong yes sorry you need to speak up if something is going totally

31:59.280 --> 32:10.000
wrong yes all right and how can people participate in the PMPC initiative how can people support you

32:10.000 --> 32:18.400
with PMPC watchdog and yeah let us know how we can join you yeah of course so one thing

32:19.040 --> 32:26.480
everybody can do is go to our website public code.eu sign our open letter which is which is

32:26.480 --> 32:32.640
really good if it does get more signatures even which increases the visibility of it

32:34.560 --> 32:42.080
download our material or the material from our website fsfe.org on public money public code spread

32:42.080 --> 32:47.200
the word spread the word in in your communities especially if you're working in in an administration

32:47.200 --> 32:53.920
or if you have contacts to people in in administration spread the word about free software and public

32:53.920 --> 33:03.040
money public code and we have developed yeah we want to empower people to do this with a workshop

33:03.040 --> 33:10.640
that we have and we can also offer to hold this workshop to tell them how they can reach out to

33:11.360 --> 33:17.920
to the administrations and what they should be aware of how they can start with all of this and

33:18.640 --> 33:27.600
how they how they get to open doors how how they get into contact and how they

33:29.120 --> 33:35.520
yeah how they can really also get some success and what does success mean in the end so we have this

33:35.520 --> 33:43.040
workshop format and we we try to yeah to give this workshop now and then to empower people to

33:43.760 --> 33:52.400
to move in this direction another thing that we have is detective detective is a is a tool to

33:52.400 --> 34:00.640
analyze European tender data which is publicly available but in a format yeah not so easy to

34:00.640 --> 34:06.720
be read by humans so our detective website helps people and our detective tools help help people

34:06.720 --> 34:14.080
who want to dig into this and see what to see what money in Europe is is really spent for in the

34:14.080 --> 34:23.360
MIT sector so do some you can you can go to this website start yeah also linked in the show

34:23.360 --> 34:34.160
north thank you and just start searching and digging digging into this a bit and see yeah where the

34:34.160 --> 34:40.240
money flows really go go there in the direction of proprietary license how much money is spent for

34:40.240 --> 34:47.280
proprietary licenses and how much money is actually spent on free software and other thing is of

34:47.280 --> 34:56.400
course if yeah anybody sees a problematic development then you can always just drop us a line

34:57.360 --> 35:05.520
go to fsv.org write us an email and inform us so we can see how we can step in there so

35:07.040 --> 35:11.760
so that's of course also something that you can do if you see problematic developments just

35:11.760 --> 35:20.240
inform us about this all right thank you so much for the short introduction to this initiative

35:20.320 --> 35:29.280
and also the introduction to all the strategies and the work going on there it's quite a catchy

35:29.280 --> 35:35.600
slogan and it's really a good initiative and a nice initiative to be part of and yeah thank you

35:35.600 --> 35:44.160
so much for also letting us know how people can so how people can oh my god now I'm missing the

35:44.720 --> 35:55.280
participates how people can participate all right I do have a last question for you okay so you know

35:56.080 --> 36:05.600
every year under 14th of February we celebrate I love free software day and even so we do this every

36:05.600 --> 36:13.120
year it's not an old fashioned initiative okay it's not an old fashioned celebration it is

36:13.120 --> 36:19.760
important and it's important to let people know we are grateful for their work because on

36:19.760 --> 36:25.760
this day we reach out to all three software contributors and say thank you thank you so much

36:25.760 --> 36:32.080
for the work you're doing for free software this helps them to stay motivated this helps us to

36:32.080 --> 36:38.960
have a nice interaction with each other and not too many salty comments on this day as we all

36:38.960 --> 36:46.560
know just happening there however it says somebody you would like to say thank you too because we

36:46.560 --> 36:51.840
should not only do this once a year we should really stick to this and do this more that's great I

36:51.840 --> 37:01.200
really love this and I remember that last time when you asked me about this I I think next cloud

37:01.200 --> 37:06.160
because next cloud is to me one of the most fascinating free software projects moving forward so

37:06.160 --> 37:10.960
fast every new version full of new ideas and new features that really help me in my everyday work

37:10.960 --> 37:17.600
and also in my private life because I'm also using it privately but yeah as I said I've already

37:17.600 --> 37:21.760
thanked the folks behind next cloud at the last I love it I said I can do it again so thank you next

37:21.760 --> 37:30.000
cloud but this time my thanks go to a project I just recently became aware of since I've started to

37:30.000 --> 37:36.240
use the backup solution bulk base and the desktop client vorta to backup my private data I feel

37:36.240 --> 37:42.560
much more relaxed when traveling with my laptop so thanks a lot to folks behind bulk days and vorta

37:44.240 --> 37:50.800
that's really good thank you I would like to add my thanks to them yes it'd be awesome

37:50.800 --> 37:59.520
doing it yeah yeah it really helps to know that your data is backup and that just in case you might

37:59.520 --> 38:06.480
need it there to back yeah absolutely really really good to know that all right thank you so much

38:06.480 --> 38:12.240
for being here Johannes and thank you so much to talking with me about public money public code it

38:12.240 --> 38:17.360
was really great and yeah thank you so much Bonnie it was really pleasure to be here thanks for having me
