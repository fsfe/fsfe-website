 <h1>FSFE Annual Report 2016</h1>
<p newsteaser="yes" style="margin: 1.5em;">
 It has been a busy year for the FSFE. Upholding the principles of 
 Free Software and protecting citizens' from being exploited
 are ongoing challenges we tackled from a variety of angles. 
 We (and by "we", we mean the staff and volunteers at the FSFE) pored 
 over hundreds of pages of policies and legislations, looking for loopholes 
 through which Free Software could be attacked.</p>
 
 <p style="margin: 1.5em;">We travelled to events all over Europe, often carrying with us dozens 
 of heavy boxes of merchandising, to explain what Free Software is all about 
 as speakers and attendees. We have organised our own events too including 
 our first international summit.</p>
 
<p style="margin: 1.5em;">And we have dreamt up and executed campaigns to spread awareness of 
the threats to Free Software and users' freedoms. This has entailed 
mobilising dozens of staff members and volunteers, contacting the media, 
and designing and ordering T-shirts, squishy stress balls/hearts, and balloons, 
lots of balloons.</p> 

<p style="margin: 1.5em;">What follows are just a few of the highlights from 2016.</p>

<h2 id="policies">Policies and Legislation</h2>

<p>We have been carefully monitoring policies and legislation in Europe 
and intervened when citizens' rights were in peril. We have formulated 
several proposals to EU institutions and EU member states containing concrete 
steps to <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/radiodirective/">solve the 
issues with the EU Radio Directive</a>. This Directive threatens software 
freedom with its ambiguous phrasing that all but forbids users from 
installing unapproved software (read "Free operating systems") on 
radio-enabled devices. These devices include all modern laptops, wireless 
routers and every single smartphone in existence. Over 40 European 
organisations and enterprises support our concerns and demands.Max Mehl 
and Polina Malaja will be doing follow-up on this with along with our volunteers 
and other organisations to make sure you can still install Free Software 
on those devices.</p>

<p>Another threat to Free Software is the EC's stance on the Digital Single 
Market strategy. We have patiently explained several times why <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2016/news-20160428-02.en.html">FRAND licensing</a>, the licensing 
favoured by the Commission in its "ICT Standardisation Priorities for the 
Digital Single Market", is incompatible with Free Software and why a more 
liberal model should be used. This is still an ongoing battle.</p> 

<p>Staying with the EC, we tried to help out on the <a href="http://k7r.eu/fossa-now-we-need-feedback-by-the-real-experts/">"Free and Open Source 
Security Audit" (FOSSA)</a> project, commissioned jointly by the European 
Parliament. The project should have helped evaluate the suitability of the 
Free Software used in public administrations. A professional audit of Free 
Software tools and frameworks would seem a good thing at first glance, an 
excellent way to test run software and improve it when bugs and vulnerabilities 
pop up. At the very least it would help protect citizens' data stored on 
public servers.</p>

<p>However, after reading the results, it was not clear that the time and 
money invested into the study had been well-spent. The conclusions were 
sometimes vague and some parts directly wrong. Despite our best efforts, 
the company employed to do the survey did not seem to know much about 
Free Software at all.</p>

<p>That said, the EC and MEPs in charge of the project, were always open 
to our comments and able to push for improvements, although they were bound 
to a contract with consultants that were not too knowledgeable about Free 
Software matters. Viewed as a pilot, it helped everybody see where the 
pitfalls were. With a bigger budget and the lessons learnt, the EU is 
planning to follow our advice and improve the project in future iterations.</p>

<p>We even put the law to the test, and our colleague Max Mehl, the FSFE 
coordinator for Germany, sent out <a href="https://blog.mehl.mx/2016/erste-testgeraete-fuer-routerfreiheit-versendet/">"alternative" routers to testers</a> so they could try them 
with their Internet provider. <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters/Implementation/Germany">We published the results on our Wiki</a> to help others 
who are thinking of changing their devices.</p>


<h2 id="campaigns">Campaigns</h2>

<figcaption><div style="text-align:center;">I Love Free Software Postcard</div></figcaption>
	</figure>
But not all our campaigns have been so serious. We have also carried 
out a campaigns to raise awareness about Free Software amongst the general 
public, and here "light-hearted" is literally the keyword. We launched 
our 6th <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2016/news-20160222-01.en.html">"I love FS" campaign</a> on Valentine's day. 
During this campaign, we encouraged all our friends to make a display of 
love towards Free Software by telling the world, online with posts to 
social media, or offline, with public demonstrations of FS love.</p>

<p>From the Internet, we got tweets and blog posts from users, volunteers and 
sympathizers explaining what they loved most about their favourite Free 
Software project. Offline, we had at least one cake baked by the WikiMedia 
Foundation, gifs of people squeezing our #ilovefs stress heart, and pictures 
of people from all over Europe waving our "[heart][heart][heart] Free Software" 
balloons.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, we wanted to help the general media, local newspapers, radios 
and TV stations, to know more about Free Software. To this end we started 
our "Meet a Free Software Hero" campaign. Part of our larger <a href="https://fsfe.org/campaigns/15years/15years">15th Anniversary 
celebration campaign</a>, we encouraged volunteers and media outlets to 
get in touch with each other so that the "heroes" could explain 
what software freedom was all about, and bust a few myths at the same time.</p>

<p>Thanks to the campaign, we managed to increase our profile with the 
media and it has now become much more usual for journalists to get in touch 
with us to comment on stories. This gives us more visibility and influence 
to affect changes in favour of Free Software.</p>

	</p>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Another way of reaching a wider audience was through events. Apart from 
participating in Free Software-specific conferences like FOSDEM, LinuxCon 
and different Linuxtage (we took the FSFE booth to all of these), we also 
participated in the <a href="https://blog.widerstroem.com/#res:ner-page=4om/weblog/10/wear-fair-2016">Wear Fair and more</a>. This event 
is Austria's largest textile fair for sustainable clothing and lifestyle, 
and covers from organic food, to DIY electronic repairs. The themes of 
sustainability, individual personal freedom and alternative economic 
models helped our Foundation fit right in and we sold plenty of 
T-shirts, bags and baby vests. We also collected contact information 
of people interested in our cause.</p>

<p>But we are prouder of the two big events we organised ourselves. In April 
we held our annual <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/legal-conference.en.html">Legal and Licensing Workshop</a>. This Workshop 
is set up by and for members of the FSFE's Legal Network. Legal experts 
from all sectors of the industry got together to discuss licenses, compliance 
and what constitutes derivative work for three days in balmy Barcelona.</p>

<p>Speakers included Harald Welte of gpl-violations.org fame; 
Miriam Ballhausen from JBB; and Eben Moglen, chairman of the Software 
Freedom Law Center.</p>

<p>Our Legal Coordinator Polina Malaja together with our trainee Olga Gkotsopoulou 
are already busy planning next years conference which we expect to be at 
least as successful as 2016's.</p>

<p>Similarly exciting was our first ever <a href="https://fsfe.org/community/events/2016/summit/backsight.en.html">FSFE Summit held in Berlin</a> in September, 
in which, Erik Albers, our community builder, commandeered a veritable 
army of volunteers and interns to make sure that everything run smoothly.</p>

<p>Part celebration of FSFE's 15th anniversary, and everything we have achieved 
over the years; part <a href="https://fsfe.org/community/events/2016/summit/frontpage">event to talk 
about the non-technical aspects of Free Software</a>, we covered the topics 
of Free Software in business, the public sector and as a force for 
social advancement in more than 50 talks. We also had our 15th 
birthday party.</p>

<p>Speakers included, among many others, the two prior presidents and the 
one current president of the FSFE, that is, Georg Greve, Karsten Gerloff, 
and Matthias Kirschner; Sonia Montegiove and Italo Vignoli, the architects 
behind the migration to LibreOffice of the Italian Armed Forces; and Roberto di Cosmo, 
co-founder along with Stefano "Zach" Zacchiroli of SoftwareHeritage.org.</p>

<p><a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2016/news-20160907-01.en.html">Julia Reda, 
MEP for the Pirate Party, closed the event</a> with a keynote on copyright
 reform and made the case for Free Software on machines critical in 
 modern democracies. She explained, for example, why using inauditable 
 proprietary software on voting machines was unacceptable.</p>

<h2 id="network">Strengthening the Free Software Network</h2>

<p>Which brings us to the subject of how we used events to make the network 
of Free Software organisations stronger. The Software Heritage mentioned 
above, for example, collects programs, applications and snippets of code 
distributed under free license from several sources. It aims to preserve 
an encyclopedia of free code for posterity. It was clear from the start 
that the FSFE and SH had a lot in common, so we supported the initiative 
early on, helping them get coverage in the media and offering them a platform 
to spread the word about what they do.</p>

<p>We also <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2016/news-20160817-01.en.html">strengthened our ties with the Document Foundation 
by joining its Advisory Board</a>. At the same time, The Document Foundation 
became an associated organisation of the FSFE. This means that we will 
be offering advice, support and suggestions on one of the most successful 
Free Software projects out there: LibreOffice and all its ecosystem. With 
the Document Foundation as an associated organisation, we created official 
channels for the exchange of ideas, coordinate efforts, motivate each other, 
and find opportunities to work together on specific projects.</p>

<p>Another thing we did was to <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2016/news-20160126-01.en.html">hand over 
the running of the FSFE's Document Freedom Day to Document Freedom Foundation</a>. The DFD 
already organises the Software Freedom Day (SFD) campaign, the Education 
Freedom Day, and the Hardware Freedom Day. It seemed logical that they 
also organise the Document Freedom Day. Like that they widened the range 
of events of related events they offer, and it allows us to concentrate 
on core Free Software topics.</p>

<h2 id="2017">Coming up in 2017</h2>

<p>But there is still a  lot of work to do and 2017 is shaping up to be 
an interesting year. Although we have managed to get the ban on compulsory 
routers into law, we expect that ISPs will fight back, so we will have 
to be on guard for that. The threat of FRAND licensing and software 
patents is never far off and we will have to continue advising lawmakers 
on why these are dangerous for Free Software and the European software 
industry in general.Katharina Nucon, policy coordinator of the German 
Pirate Party, will be helping us with this campaign.</p>

<p>Most of our efforts, however, will most likely be spent pushing for 
getting more public institutions to publish their software under a free 
license. We want public money to pay for public code, and only public code. 
Software used by public institutions is acquired, deployed and/or developed 
with taxpayers' money. Making it available under a Free license to all 
citizens is just the right thing to do. Furthermore, we hope we will raise 
awareness amongst politicians of the importance of using Free Software 
when they see its advantages.</p>

<p>There are several important national and regional elections scheduled 
throughout Europe in 2017. Politicians are supposedly more receptive during 
campaigns, so we will do our best to make candidates and parties commit 
to Free Software and openness in their administrations.</p>

<p>We need governments to commit to improving policies that favour Free 
Software across the board. It is not admissible any more that the 
administration pilfer taxpayers money on proprietary software.</p>

<p>We need policies that help the European IT sector become much more competitive 
and sustainable. There is no better way to achieve this than incentivising 
the use and development of Free Software and Open Standards.</p>

<p>Finally we need better policies to help promote Free Software amongst 
the general public. Every European citizen must be allowed to regain 
control over the technology they use once and for all.</p>



<h2 id="tl">TL;DR</h2>

<p>This has been a long report, but if you need a summary, here goes:</p>

<p>Free Software improves everybody's life and the world. It is clear that
 everybody have been handed
  the short end of the IT stick for too long. SMEs need a level playing ground
   to prosper and create employment. Private citizens and business owners must 
   be allowed to own and control the devices they pay for. Governments must be 
   at the service of the people, as must the software they pay for with people's 
   taxes. Free Software, Free Hardware and Open Standards solve all of the above.</p>

<p>All of these things should be self-evident, but apparently are not. 
That is why we at the FSFE do what we do. Throughout this report we have 
mentioned some of the people that work to turn these things into reality. However, and 
it may sound cliché, but it doesn't make it less true, without the continued 
support from you, the volunteer, the fellow, the occasional donor, and the moral 
supporter, none of our staff would be able to do anything. We rely heavily on you, 
your activities and your donations to stay independent and fight for your rights 
when they are threatened, regardless as to where the threat comes from.</p>

<p>Please help us make next year's report is as long as this one.</p>

<p>Best Regards,<br></br>
Jonas Öberg (Executive Director) and Matthias Kirschner (President)
