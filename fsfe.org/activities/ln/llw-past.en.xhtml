		<p>The FSFE's annual Free Software Legal and Licensing workshop (LLW) was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The decision was not an easy one to take, but the well-being of all participants and staff was of a greater priority for the FSFE. Unfortunately, with the short notice of the cancellation of the event, we were not able to offer any remote attendance options as an alternative for the event.

more than 40 presentations on wide variety of legal issues. After more than a decade-long tradition of LLW,
 we decided to bring the event back to its roots and emphasise the "Workshop" part in its original title,
  resulting in unprecedented amount of parallel interactive sessions aimed at coming up with concrete results.
   Hence the theme for LLW2018: <strong>"Putting 'W' back to Legal and Licensing Workshop"</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The role of Free Software in the 21st century</strong><br />

		<h2 id="llw2017">The Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop 2017</h2>

Based on the topics discussed throughout the years and the feedback we collected, it seemed that several prominent topics for discussions needed to be reopened in order to address emerging challenges. Hence this year's workshop was held under the theme:
		<strong>Restart</strong></p>
		
		<p>Some of the topics we discussed:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Open Government</strong><br />

		<p>Backed up by the feedback and experience we collected in the past few years, we decided to continue with the trend of addressing important challenges.

		<h2 id="llw2015">The Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop 2015</h2>
		
		<p>In 2015 the workshop took place, once again, in Barcelona on 16-17 April, receiving more than 90 experts from all around the world. Instead of rehashing familiar topics, we looked at what problems we will likely encounter in the next five to ten years. Each day we had two topics to spur interesting debate in the room as well as the hallway. As always, the workshop was held under the <a href="/activities/ln/rules.html#chr">Chatham House Rule</a>, to encourage an open and unencumbered debate.</p>

		<h3>Topics</h3>
		
		<p>In 2015 we held a pre-event on 15 April, called the Open* Day, to explore topics beside software. In particular:

			</ul>
		</p>
