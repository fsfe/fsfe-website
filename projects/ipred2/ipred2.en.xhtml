    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

    <p>
      IPRED2, The second &quot;Intellectual Property&quot; Rights
      Enforcement Directive, has at it's core:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      &quot;Member States shall ensure that all intentional
      infringements of an intellectual property right on a commercial
      scale, and attempting, aiding or abetting and inciting such
      infringements, are treated as criminal offences.&quot;<br />
      (Article 3.  Page 6
      of <a
      href="http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2005/com2005_0276en01.pdf">the
      text (com 2005 0276)</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
      The EU definition of &quot;Intellectual property&quot; lumps
      together patents, copyright, trademarks, and many other
      categories of law.
    </p>


    <h2 id="harm">Harmful effects on software freedom</h2>


    <h3>Software patents: Enforcement through fear</h3>

    <p>
      Although the European Patent Convention excludes software from
      patentability, the European Patent Office is currently approving
      software patent applications.  This gives software patent
      holders a legal basis to threaten software
      producers/distributors with litigation.  While &gt;90% of such
      litigation would fail in court, the threat of jail time, seizing
      of assets, and closure of business could make people obey these
      invalid patents through fear.
    </p>


    <h3>Harm to efficient software production/distribution models</h3>

    <p>
      Greatly increasing the risks of software
      development/distribution will have a chilling effect on
      producers/distributors who operate in structures that don't
      include large legal defense funds.  Free Software, which is
      often written by individuals and by businesses whose core
      business is not software, would be particularly harmed by harm
      to these business models.
    </p>


    <h3>Encouragement of commercial abuse, like SCOs</h3>

    <p>
      If we give litigators increased access to national enforcement
      bodies, and if we increase the harmful effects of litigation, we
      will encourage people to use litigation as a commercial tool in
      the market.  SCO in the USA is the biggest example of this,
      without proving anything or even showing any evidence, they have
      accused IBM and others of intentional, commercial-scale
      &quot;IP&quot; infringement, and have slowed the adoption rate
      of Free Software such as GNU/Linux and harmed the reputation of
      a handful of companies (competitors to Microsoft, one of SCO's
      majory funders).
    </p>

    <h3>Inability to indemnify</h3>

    <p>
      Since criminal offenses cannot be indemnified against, patent
      litigation insurance would not be possible, and software
      producers could no longer indemnify distributors of their
      software.
    </p>


    <h2 id="text">Reading the proposal text</h2>

    <p>
      IPRED2
      (<a
      href="http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2005/com2005_0276en01.pdf">com
      2005 0276</a>) has two parts: pages 2 to 8 of the proposal are a
      Directive, and pages 9 to 16 are a Council Framework Decision.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Council Framework Decision is there to give the European
      Union permission to enact a directive which requires criminal
      sanctions for &quot;intellectual property right&quot;
      infringements.
    </p>

    <p>
      The major problems are in the Directive.  Specifically, Articles
      3 and 4 (pages 6 and 7 of the document).  Article 3 is quoted
      above in it's entirety.  Article 4 lists the punishments that
      must be made available for the to-be criminals.  Other problems
      include the use of terminology such as &quot;intellectual
      property&quot;, and propaganda terms such as &quot;piracy&quot;.
    </p>


    <h2 id="options">What we can do</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	We can ask our national governments to reject the Council
	Framework Decision.  This would take away the legal foundation
	for the Directive.  The Framework Decision needs unanimity
	from the 25 member states.
      </li>

      <li>
	We can lobby the European Parliament and the Council of
	Ministers to limit criminal sanctions to cases where the
	infringement was done to fund organised crime or caused a
	health or safety risk to the public.
      </li>

      <li>
	We can lobby the European Parliament and the Council of
	Ministers to remove the criminalisation of &quot;attempting,
	aiding or abetting and inciting [intellectual property right]
	infringements&quot;
      </li>

      <li>
	We can lobby the European Parliament to simply reject this
	Directive.
      </li>
