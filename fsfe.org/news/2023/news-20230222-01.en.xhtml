<h1>Call for Papers for foss-north open (Gothenburg, April 2023)</h1>

<p>foss-north is a Free Software conference in Gothenburg that brings 
together Nordic Free Software communities. This year, the Free Software 
Foundation Europe is organising a track covering political and legal 
aspects of Free Software, as well as best practices from Scandinavia. 
We're looking forward to your contribution by March 5!</p>

<p><a href="https://foss-north.se/2023">This year's foss-north</a> will 
take place on 24 and 25 April, following a community day on 23 April. 
It will be a local, face-to-face event. While in the past <a href="https://foss-north.se">foss-north</a> has focused on the 
technical aspects of Free Software, this year there will also be room 
for presenting best practice examples as well as political, legal, and 
social issues related to software freedom.</p>

<p>We are looking for your exciting talks and insights! Please submit 
your abstract <a href="https://foss-north.se/events/2023/callforpapers/">directly to the 
foss-north website</a> by 5 March 2023 23:59 CET.</p>

<p>Your contribution could address (but is not limited to) any of the 
following questions: Where in your community, municipality, city or 
region is Free Software helping to shape the digital infrastructure? 
What interesting Free Software projects are being developed and adopted 
by your university, school, library, job centre or elsewhere, <a href="https://publiccode.eu">using public money to create public 
code</a>? How can administrations foster software solutions that 
preserve the freedom of citizens and the sovereignty of our democracy? 
How can we as programmers, users, scientists, officials, politicians, 
and citizens contribute to software freedom? How can we <a href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index">regain 
control of our devices</a>?</p>

<p>Contributions on other Free Software related topics and projects 
will also be considered for selection. Our session slots are 45 and 25 
minutes. Please indicate your preferred length in your submission notes 
and using tags. The final programme will be announced by mid-March 
2023.</p>

<p>foss-north is the perfect opportunity for you to share your 
knowledge and get in touch with other people passionate about Free 
Software. We look forward to seeing you in Gothenburg!</p>
