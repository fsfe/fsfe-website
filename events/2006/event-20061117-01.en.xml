    <title>Fellowship meeting in Vienna</title>
    <body>
      The sixth Austrian Fellowship meeting takes place on 17 November
      in Vienna. We meet around 18:00 in the Lounge at the Metalab,
      Rathausstra√üe 6, first district. The "official" agenda will start at
      19:00.<br/>

      Some of the Fellows that have been on the first international Fellowship
      meeting in Bolzano will be there to report from that event. The Freedom
      Task Force which was presented there will also be a topic for the
      evening.<br/>

      As usual, this invitation addresses to all people interested in FSFE or
      Free Software. We are looking forward to many attendants!
