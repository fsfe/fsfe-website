        I am a strong supporter of the ideas behind free software and a daily
user of free software. I think a voice that explains why Free Software
is good for society and what are the conditions under which the Free
Software ecosystem can grow is vitally important. By joining FSF and
FSFE, I wanted to say thanks to free software advocates and developers
and help in maintaining political conditions that allow and favor free
software development and use.

        I joined as a Fellow since I wanted to support FSFE's work to promote
free software. As a person that uses computers quite heavily every
day, I'm very concerned with the current trend of locking down
computing which is taking control away from the users. This is
increasingly problematic since people's lives are more and more
dependent on computers for personal communications, managing finances,
employment, etc. Free software is a necessary requirement for
retaining control over your computing.

        Free Software challenges you to learn: to do for yourself, to be 
        fearlessly independent when it comes to your tech. In the past few 
        years I have taken pride in watching my skill base catchup with and 
        overtake that of my proprietary-loving peers, even some paid 
        professionals, simply by having a free and curious mindset. Free 
        Software frees you in many ways.

        The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) brings together dedicated 
        and engaged activists from all over Europe to seize the opportunities 
        to secure our rights to use, share, study, and improve software because 
        without Free Software, technology subjugates us instead of enhancing 
        our freedom.

        I joined the Fellowship to stop being &#39;a minority of one&#39;, as 
        George Orwell once put it. I wanted to meet people who shared my ideals 
        and beliefs, so it would no longer feel as if I was fighting the system 
        all by myself. It&#39;s reassuring to know that you&#39;re not alone, 
        which probably motivates people to keep up with the work they are 
        doing, even if it&#39;s not always as successful as they would like it 
        to be.

        Freedom is one of the core values of our Society and one of the basic 
        concepts of Democracy. Supporting and spreading Free Software is one 
        way to build creative alternatives for social inclusion and to protect 
        our citizens from the digital exploitation. We are responsible to build 
        a better World as a gift for our future generations.

        I&#39;m very impressed with what the FSFE has achieved on the EU and 
        national level. Back when I was working in the public sector I was able 
        to glimpse the vast amounts of money that are thrown at lobbying for 
        proprietary software and so called industry standards in Germany and 
        the EU. It&#39;s astonishing how the FSFE has still managed to get 
        itself heard. Supporting this was one of my motivations for becoming a 
        fellow.

        Free software is important in our time. It needs professional 
        representation which is hard work and expensive. Joining the fellowship

        free software movement to ensure it&#39;s future.

        I was a solitary voice for years, explaining the principles behind Free 
        Software and its importance for people in my country in numerous 
        articles and blog posts. I wanted to belong to an organization with the 
        goal of building the digital society on 100% free software, and 
        supporting the FSFE and gaining access to its blogging and fellowship 
        infrastructure seemed like a logical first step.

        Free software and FSFE is to me: sharing, learning, being independent 
        of monopolies, producing things together, passion and freedom! Since 
        I've been a Fellow, I am finding new friends who help me in Free 
        Software and other topics, teaching new things every day even though we 
        are kilometers away. It is magnificent to be in a community that 
        continually supports my Free Software passion and motivation!

        Free Software needs a voice in politics. We volunteers do amazing 
        things together, but some tasks are not that much fun, or are time 
        sensitive or need extensive expertise. FSFE can only tap its full 
        potential with paid staff to do the things the volunteers wouldn't get 
        to. By now, I met all of the staff and can say that I don't regret a 
        cent I've given to allow the FSFE to operate.

        If software is licensed as free software, we can audit it, and be sure 
        that it does what it's intended to do (and nothing else). Public 
        institutions develop software, and hire companies to make it, and the 
        citizens should own and reuse all that code. I contribute to free 
        software with translations, user help desk, finding free software 
        alternatives at the University... but I cannot reach the policy-makers, 
        nor people and institutions in other countries. I'm fellow to support 
        the FSFE doing this task, and as one more way to say thank you to the 
        free software community.

        I have always been fascinated by free software. I'm supporting free 
        software projects in my spare time. My education as well as my work 
        would not be possible without free software. The fellow group in Berlin 
        showed me how to contribute to free software in a non-technical way. It 
        was and still is great fun to work with them in a cogenial atmosphere. 
        As I'm involed in the group now, I think it is time to join the FSFE 
        officially and to support them financially.

        I join the fellowship because I'm seeing more and more that writing 
        free code is ultimately not enough to foster a culture where free 
        software is seen as an integral part of society. Free software should 
        not be a fringe topic supported solely by geeks.

        I have been using free software for years, during the last couple month 
        I started "giving" back, by supporting on forums and writing smaller 
        patches. But I felt like free software deserves some money, too. And 
        the Free Software Foundation is simply the best place for the money to 
        go. I also wanted to show my support for Free Software publicly.

        I started doing UNIX sysadmin work while a visiting scientist at MIT in
