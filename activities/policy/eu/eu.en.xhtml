    <h1>Free Software in the European Union</h1>

    <p id="introduction"> 
      The FSFE actively promote the use of Free Software at the European level. European Institutions and member state's public bodies should already use and distribute Free Software which are the best way to fit with their obligations of transparency, non-discrimation and interoperability. 
    </p>
    <p>In order to defend efficiently Free Software in Europe we have defined global policy goals which are our guiding principles in the activities we lead.  </p>
