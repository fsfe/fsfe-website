                <dd class="description">Delivery of e-mails on our mailing lists is delayed. The issue could be pined to AI training harvester crawlers that crawled our public mailing list archives. The delay went meanwhile down from several days, to around 2 hours, but is meanwhile back up at around 2 days.<br />
                    Mails that are send to the mailinglists are processed and will be delivered and are not lost. So please do not resent e-mails.<br />
                    Emails directed to personal email addresses continue to work.<br />
                    The exact issue in our setup causing the delay is still under investigation.</dd>
