	<center><h2>Free Software Experts</h2></center>

	<p> Who wasn't, at least once, depressed because so called <a
	    href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.fr.html">Free
	    Software</a> projects were financed despite the fact that
	    they had nothing to do with Free Software ? Europe will
	    soon finance new projects and we can prevent these
	    accidents by becoming <a
	    href="http://candidature.cordis.lu/expert-evaluators/">External
	    Experts</a>. It will then be more difficult to claim that
	    nothing could be done : our skills are required to
	    validate the candidate projects.
	</p>

	<p> The <a href="http://www.cordis.lu/fp5/src/over.htm">Fifth
	    Framework Programme</a> (FP5) of the European Commission
	    <a href="http://www.cordis.lu/fp5-openings/home.html">needs
	    experts</a>.  Among the candidates who proposed themselves
	    thru the <a
	    href="http://candidature.cordis.lu/expert-evaluators/">online
	    application form</a>, only a few of them have a real
	    understanding of what Free Software is and how it
	    works. Candidates will be eligible, but only a few will
	    really be solicited. In every case the experts only speak
	    for themselves, not for their employer nor for
	    organizations they belong to. Early October 2001 a number
	    of projects will be sent for evaluation in the <i><a
	    href="http://www.cordis.lu/fp5/src/t-2.htm">Creating a
	    user-friendly information society</a></i> framework.
	</p>

	<p> Who will then be able, regardless of technical matters, to
	  judge if a project that calls itself Free Software is not a
	  marketing attempt to use a fashionable word ?  The
	  candidates know that the European Commission wishes to
	  encourage Free Software projects because of their intrinsic
	  qualities of freedom, independence and sharing.  The
	  temptation will be great for them to pretend they have the
	  technical and human resources necessary to create and
	  maintain a Free Software project event if they don't have
	  the slightest idea of what it really means. If no expert
	  have a real knowledge of Free Software project development,
	  how will the European Commission be able to sort that out ?
	</p>

	<p> An example demonstrates this. Let's pretend that the <a
	  href="http://www.gnupki.org/fr/index.php">GNU PKI</a>
	  project and the <a
	  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/glue/">GNU GLUE</a> project
	  <a href="http://www.cordis.lu/ist/ka4/tesss/prog.htm">submit
	  proposals</a> that are equally good technically speaking 
	  (regardless of the fact that they deal with different subjects).
	  Let's pretend again that the commission has to make a choice 
	  between the two, without the help of experts knowing Free 
	  Software. Their favor will probably go to GNU PKI since they
	  do a better job at marketing themselves.
	</p>

	<p> It turns out that people knowing Free Software would
	  detect a few strange things on GNU PKI. First of all it is
	  not a package of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU
	  project</a>, despite their name. When one knows that the
	  GNU project is the foundation of every Free Software operating
	  system currently distributed (Debian, RedHat, Mandrake etc.),
	  this mistake implies a disturbing ignorance. Free Software is
	  a matter of communicating with heterogeneous development groups,
	  this is therefore a point that plays against them. In addition,
	  the security expert of GNU PKI, Mr
	  Eduard Tric, <a
	  href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22eduard+tric%22">never
	  participated in a Free Software development</a> and no
	  package of the software developed so far is available.
	</p>

	<p>
	  GNU PKI is therefore obviously launched by people who are
	  new to Free Software. One cannot expect all the cases to be
	  so simple. Evaluating a project, for the European Commission
	  or for your own company often requires a more subtle study.
	  When dealing with Free Software it is mandatory to carefully
	  evaluate the legal protection because various licenses are
	  used and many companies are involved. Their ability to
	  cooperate with development teams on the network, their ability
	  to establish a dialog and their current involvement in the
	  Free Software community is also of great consequences. Those
	  points are not technical, they don't have an equivalent in 
	  non-free software projects and can only be evaluated by people
	  actively involved in Free Software.
