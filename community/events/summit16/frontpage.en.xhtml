	<p style="margin-top: 2em, font-size:1.15em;"><img src="./pics/europe-at-night-250px.jpg" align="right" /><em>Imagine a European Union that builds its IT infrastructure on Free Software. Imagine European Member States that exchange information in Open Standards and share their software. Imagine municipalities and city councils that benefit from decentralized and collaborative software under free licenses. Imagine no European is any longer forced to use non-Free Software.</em></p>

	<p>This is what we are seeking. And although this vision feels like a long road to go, we know that we are taking major steps along it today. To help unlock our full potential on this road, FSFE offers cross-border collaboration and in 2016 its first European summit. Join us and our movement.</p>

	
     <h1>The idea of the summit</h1>
     
      <p>The FSFE summit is the main event to bring together FSFE members and supporters from all over Europe. In a conference style, we offer rooms and slots during the days for our community to present their ideas and interests. These community sessions again are embedded in an environment of talks and presentations by external speakers and professionals. Expect inspiring inputs in and out our diverse community with a mix between prominent speakers and newcomers, both from various countries over Europe. The talks are non-technical and each summit day, we have another major theme to focus on:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="#business">On Friday, September 2nd</a>, talks are dedicated to business with or around Free Software.</li> 
	  <li><a href="#policies">On Saturday, September 3rd</a>, talks cover various aspects of Free Software policies and lobbying as well as community building. Also, there will be our 15 years of FSFE celebration in the evening.</li> 
	  <li><a href="#beyondcode">On Sunday, September 4th</a>, we go one step ahead and offer talks and input about universal access beyond code.</li> 
	</ul>
	
      <p style="margin-top:2em"><b>By and for the community</b></p>
      
      <p>This is an event for the FSFE community. Hence, if you are a Fellow, a supporter or a friend of the FSFE, this event is for you! However, we believe that our community is not defined by membership only. More than that, the FSFE is a European association whose idea is to represent and channel the voice of all European Free Software communities. Means, even if you are part of another Free Software community but you can align with <a href="/about/mission">FSFE and our mission</a>, this event is for you. We like the Free Software movement to grow and stand together. Therefore, there will be a dedicated session during the summit, in that we invite national Free Software organisations to represent themselves, their work and their goals. Together we are strong and we can make a difference. If you like to represent your organisation, please <a href="mailto:summit2016@fsfe.org">get in contact</a> so we can plan accordingly.</p>
	
      
      
     <h1>The setting and the venue</h1>
      
      <p><img src="./pics/bcc_teaser_das_bcc_0-200px.jpg" align="right" />The first FSFE summit is organised as a subconference of the <a href="http://qtcon.org/">QtCon</a> that takes place in the <a href="http://www.bcc-berlin.de/en">Berlin Congress Center (BCC)</a>. Together with Qt Contributors, VideoLAN, KDAB and KDE, this event brings together five Free Software communities and projects under one roof. Although this comes with some mutual limitations, it comes with so much more benefits and synergy effects that we are more than happy for this opportunity. After all, it gives us the freedom to invest more of our energy into the actual content for the first FSFE summit instead of into the logistics. And a key benefit for our participants is that you have access to any talk from all involved communities and their subconferences.</p>
      
      
     <h1>Attendance and community</h1>
      
      <p>Because the FSFE summit is part of the QtCon, entrance to the FSFE summit includes entrance to the conferences of Qt Contributors, VideoLAN, KDAB and KDE as well. Also included is catering during the three conference days as well as entrance to the Friday night and our "15 years of FSFE" Saturday night event. <a href="./attendance">Read more details on our attendance-page</a></p>
      
      
      <p>Although we have to cover a lot of costs, it was important for us to enable attendance to the FSFE summit for no cost for our community members. This leads us into the situation in that <a href="./attendance#donation">entrance is possible for free, but we ask you to consider donating</a>. In any case, when you register and you are a <a href="https://fsfe.org/fellowship/index">Fellow of the FSFE</a>, please <a href="./attendance#registration">mark that you are member of our community</a>. This will help us for our internal evaluation and improvements for a possible next summit.</p>
