    <description>
      STACS (Science, Technology and Civil Society) is a project that seeks
      to bridge the gap between civil society and research in order to
      increase the societal relevance of research being done. The project aims
      to accomplish by educating both civil society organisations and
      researchers, and finding common projects to work on for the future.
