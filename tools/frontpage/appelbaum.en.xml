        I believe that actions of support for the FSFE are important for
        encouraging Free Software development and adoption in Europe as well
        as the rest of the world. I&#39;m an FSFE Fellow because financially
        supporting the cause of Free Software brings positive improvements to
        all societies throughout the world.
