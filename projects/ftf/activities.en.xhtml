      The Freedom Task Force collects and shares knowledge about Free
      Software law, safeguards the interests of Free Software projects,
      connects experts throughout the world and helps other groups
      achieve similar goals.  We do this in partnership with
      gpl-violations.org and members of the European Legal Network.

        <h2>European Legal Network</h2>

        <p>
          We facilitate the <a href="network.html">European Legal
          Network</a> (ELN), a private network of legal 
          professionals with over 200
          members across 27 countries and four continents.  
          Members share knowledge
          across national borders and cooperate to increase the availability of
          information related to best practice in Free Software licensing.
        </p>

        <h2>Conference</h2>

        <p>
          We host a yearly legal conference called the '<a href="activities-workshop.html">ELN Workshop</a>'
          to discuss the current market situation and
          projected future for Free Software licenses.  The next ELN
          Workshop is scheduled to take place in Amsterdam, The
          Netherlands, on the 8th and 9th of April 2010.

        <h2>Special Interest Groups</h2>

        <p>
          We organize special interest groups to discuss topics like
          business processes and the supply chain, software patents and code
          management in the embedded industry.  These groups are designed to
          reduce misunderstandings, share knowledge and address aress where
          there is a lack of available guidance.
