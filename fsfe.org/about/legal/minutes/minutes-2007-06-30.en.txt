         (see attached file "1_cleanups.diff")

      b) clarify that chapters are established on demand after
         agreement of the general assembly, not always.
         (see attached file "2_chapters.diff")

      c) remove position "Head of Office" and replace by "Executive
         Advisor" to be added to Extended Executive Committee. This

         find understanding on this point until the general assembly.
