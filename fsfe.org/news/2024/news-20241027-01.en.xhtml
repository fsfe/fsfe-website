<p>The third edition of the <a href="/activities/yh4f">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom (YH4F)</a> competition, 
organised by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), has 
successfully concluded with an inspiring award ceremony weekend in 
Brussels. Six young developers from across Europe were recognized for 
their outstanding Free Software projects, presenting their work in front 
of an audience that included their families, jury members, and new-found 
friends. YH4F is a unique programming contest designed to give Europeans 
aged 14 to 18 the opportunity to showcase their programming skills and 
creativity by developing Free Software projects. After six months of 
intensive programming, the jury selected the top six projects. These 
winners were invited to Brussels for the award ceremony, where they had 
the chance to present their projects and participate  alongside their 
peers, jury members and their relatives in a weekend filled with 
engaging activities.</p>

<h2>Empowering Europe’s next generation of developers</h2> 
<p>The <a href="/activities/yh4f">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</a> competition continues to grow, 
attracting more and more young people who share a passion for 
programming. They all share the interest in Free Software and the desire 
to take control of their technology. In an 
era where digital tools shape every aspect of our lives, it is vital 
that future generations have the knowledge and ability to create, 
modify, use, and share the software they rely on. By empowering young 
developers to create and contribute to Free Software, YH4F helps foster 
a culture of openness, transparency, and software freedom.</p>
