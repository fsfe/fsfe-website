00:00.000 --&gt; 00:20.000
Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast. This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:20.000 --&gt; 00:24.000
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:24.000 --&gt; 00:28.000
I'm Bonnie Merring and our guest for today is Stanislas Dolceini.

00:28.000 --&gt; 00:36.000
Stanislas is a video game artist and contributes to the Free Software Video Game Zero AD Empires Accentant.

00:36.000 --&gt; 00:42.000
Zero AD is a Free Software Ancient Warfare game, which is developed by the World Fire Games

00:42.000 --&gt; 00:48.000
and Stanislas is also the current project leader of Zero AD Empires Accentant.

00:48.000 --&gt; 00:50.000
Hi Stan.

00:50.000 --&gt; 00:52.000
Hi.

00:52.000 --&gt; 00:56.000
How are your first thoughts when you hear Free Software?

00:56.000 --&gt; 01:06.000
Well, I think it's good. I have a very good feeling about Free Software. I'm a programmer for my other jobs

01:06.000 --&gt; 01:12.000
so I tend to use stuff that is open source and free and leap when I care.

01:12.000 --&gt; 01:18.000
I've always been someone who believes that it's important of sharing things

01:18.000 --&gt; 01:22.000
and give them to the most people so they can make the most out of it.

01:22.000 --&gt; 01:28.000
I'm really a free software enthusiast.

01:28.000 --&gt; 01:34.000
How would you explain Zero AD Empires Accentance to a non-gamer?

01:34.000 --&gt; 01:40.000
Well, I would say it's a game about building an empire.

01:40.000 --&gt; 01:44.000
You would start with something really small, like a main building.

01:44.000 --&gt; 01:46.000
You usually call the Civic Center.

01:46.000 --&gt; 01:54.000
Starting from there, you would expand to colonize everything around the Civic Center

01:54.000 --&gt; 02:04.000
and eventually fight with other people or the AI, the artificial intelligence that you can fight during the game.

02:04.000 --&gt; 02:10.000
So, to put it simply, it's just a city builder game.

02:10.000 --&gt; 02:16.000
If you've heard of Age of Empires, it's really similar to that game.

02:16.000 --&gt; 02:18.000
Yeah, that's about it.

02:18.000 --&gt; 02:24.000
And I was wondering, would you say that it's ever going to be finished

02:24.000 --&gt; 02:28.000
and there's a final release?

02:28.000 --&gt; 02:30.000
Well, I don't know.

02:30.000 --&gt; 02:34.000
I'm pretty sure we are not any close to it.

02:34.000 --&gt; 02:40.000
The thing is, it's open source, so anyone can feel contributing to the game

02:40.000 --&gt; 02:42.000
and improving things.

02:42.000 --&gt; 02:44.000
I don't think anything can ever be perfect.

02:44.000 --&gt; 02:48.000
I think we can get close to something that is definitive

02:48.000 --&gt; 02:52.000
and move on to another project.

02:52.000 --&gt; 02:56.000
Actually, in the beginning of the project, they wanted to make several games.

02:56.000 --&gt; 03:00.000
So, Welfare Games is the publisher.

03:00.000 --&gt; 03:04.000
Azure AD is the name of the series, so, like Age of Empires.

03:04.000 --&gt; 03:08.000
And the current game is Empires Incendent.

03:08.000 --&gt; 03:12.000
And there was supposed to be a sequel called Empires Procedure,

03:12.000 --&gt; 03:14.000
but we haven't started that yet.

03:14.000 --&gt; 03:20.000
So, the idea was to make multiple games using the same engine.

03:20.000 --&gt; 03:24.000
So, yeah, there are two things that are alpha by playing the game.

03:24.000 --&gt; 03:26.000
There is the engine.

03:26.000 --&gt; 03:28.000
Pyrogen is this.

03:28.000 --&gt; 03:32.000
And there is the game, Empires Incendent.

03:32.000 --&gt; 03:36.000
So, I think that the engine will never be finished.

03:36.000 --&gt; 03:38.000
It's something that is constantly evolving,

03:38.000 --&gt; 03:40.000
just like technology is constantly evolving.

03:40.000 --&gt; 03:44.000
We always have new versions of languages,

03:44.000 --&gt; 03:48.000
OSs, hardware, everything to support.

03:48.000 --&gt; 03:52.000
So, it's going to be a constant fight to keep it working everywhere.

03:52.000 --&gt; 03:58.000
But the game might get into somewhat finished state.

03:58.000 --&gt; 04:00.000
But I don't think it's going to come soon,

04:00.000 --&gt; 04:04.000
because we'll keep adding new features to the engine,

04:04.000 --&gt; 04:08.000
making the game constantly evolving.

04:08.000 --&gt; 04:12.000
What are some of the new features you have planned?

04:12.000 --&gt; 04:18.000
There are a lot of things like, we wanted to add multiple attacks,

04:18.000 --&gt; 04:22.000
per unit. So, for instance, an archer that would get attacked

04:22.000 --&gt; 04:26.000
up close, which is like through a sword or something to fight

04:26.000 --&gt; 04:30.000
in Nilly instead of ranged.

04:30.000 --&gt; 04:32.000
Some people wanted to add acceleration,

04:32.000 --&gt; 04:36.000
someone directional damage, someone trample,

04:36.000 --&gt; 04:42.000
like when a horse gets into a pit of like units

04:42.000 --&gt; 04:44.000
and just like smash everything around it.

04:44.000 --&gt; 04:48.000
There are a lot of features that are depths

04:48.000 --&gt; 04:52.000
to the fighting that we might want to add.

04:52.000 --&gt; 04:56.000
But this is an entirely volunteer project.

04:56.000 --&gt; 05:00.000
These things can take time.

05:00.000 --&gt; 05:02.000
They need more time to get polished.

05:02.000 --&gt; 05:08.000
And so, the features like can come really slow.

05:08.000 --&gt; 05:12.000
So, there's still some features in the pipe

05:12.000 --&gt; 05:14.000
that you're planning to implement, but you won't,

05:14.000 --&gt; 05:18.000
you're not yet sure when they will be polished.

05:18.000 --&gt; 05:20.000
When they will be implemented.

05:20.000 --&gt; 05:22.000
I see, I see.

05:22.000 --&gt; 05:24.000
I have also read that it's a really high priority for you

05:24.000 --&gt; 05:28.000
and your team that you build stuff like very accurate

05:28.000 --&gt; 05:30.000
and things like that.

05:30.000 --&gt; 05:36.000
Yeah, there has been always a very eye drive

05:36.000 --&gt; 05:40.000
to keep things historically accurate,

05:40.000 --&gt; 05:44.000
which I mean a really, really frustrating way.

05:44.000 --&gt; 05:46.000
For instance, there was some really nice buildings

05:46.000 --&gt; 05:50.000
that were in Alpha 23 that we had to remove

05:50.000 --&gt; 05:52.000
because they were not historically accurate.

05:52.000 --&gt; 05:54.000
So, we try to keep things precise,

05:54.000 --&gt; 05:58.000
like try to find archeological evidence

05:58.000 --&gt; 06:02.000
about helmets, but swords, but whatever,

06:02.000 --&gt; 06:06.000
or what the people to try to do at the time

06:06.000 --&gt; 06:10.000
you give them meaningful technologies.

06:10.000 --&gt; 06:14.000
And can in the hopes that you would learn some things

06:14.000 --&gt; 06:16.000
from playing the game, like, I don't know,

06:16.000 --&gt; 06:20.000
this, that sells invented barrels, for instance,

06:20.000 --&gt; 06:22.000
or stuff like this.

06:22.000 --&gt; 06:24.000
Oh, what do you say?

06:24.000 --&gt; 06:26.000
Does it cost a lot of time?

06:26.000 --&gt; 06:28.000
Because if I imagine this and if I think about

06:28.000 --&gt; 06:30.000
how you have to do all this research,

06:30.000 --&gt; 06:34.000
then you actually have to design a house

06:34.000 --&gt; 06:38.000
or a barn or a horse or a gear.

06:38.000 --&gt; 06:40.000
Yeah, it takes a lot of time.

06:40.000 --&gt; 06:42.000
And usually it's not done by the same people.

06:42.000 --&gt; 06:46.000
So, you get the nitpakers' historians

06:46.000 --&gt; 06:48.000
and you get the artists that are trying to fit

06:48.000 --&gt; 06:50.000
whatever they need to do.

06:50.000 --&gt; 06:52.000
So, they have to change stuff a lot

06:52.000 --&gt; 06:54.000
because, well, you don't know.

06:54.000 --&gt; 06:56.000
No, they shouldn't be this there

06:56.000 --&gt; 06:58.000
because it's not the same period

06:58.000 --&gt; 07:00.000
or it doesn't belong there.

07:00.000 --&gt; 07:02.000
And so, yeah, but it also

07:02.000 --&gt; 07:04.000
allows people from different backgrounds

07:04.000 --&gt; 07:08.000
and different expertise to join the project.

07:08.000 --&gt; 07:10.000
So, for instance, if you're an historian,

07:10.000 --&gt; 07:12.000
then you just want to get feedback and insights.

07:12.000 --&gt; 07:14.000
It's good.

07:14.000 --&gt; 07:16.000
One of the civilizations called the Kushits

07:16.000 --&gt; 07:20.000
was entirely done by someone

07:20.000 --&gt; 07:22.000
who would just say, oh, I love this civilization.

07:22.000 --&gt; 07:24.000
I want to get a freak out into the game.

07:24.000 --&gt; 07:26.000
Well, at least like,

07:26.000 --&gt; 07:30.000
it's current Ethiopia, I think.

07:30.000 --&gt; 07:32.000
But, yeah, it wanted to

07:32.000 --&gt; 07:34.000
get that civilization to the game.

07:34.000 --&gt; 07:36.000
So, it did a lot of research about

07:36.000 --&gt; 07:38.000
archaeological findings,

07:38.000 --&gt; 07:40.000
pictures and everything.

07:40.000 --&gt; 07:42.000
And the research was so detailed

07:42.000 --&gt; 07:48.000
that it motivated artists to start

07:48.000 --&gt; 07:50.000
building stuff on top of it.

07:50.000 --&gt; 07:52.000
And we got a new civilization in Alpha 23

07:52.000 --&gt; 07:54.000
because of that.

07:54.000 --&gt; 07:56.000
That's really impressive.

07:56.000 --&gt; 07:58.000
Like, there's just one historian

07:58.000 --&gt; 08:00.000
who is really a nerd

08:00.000 --&gt; 08:02.000
for his field.

08:02.000 --&gt; 08:04.000
And then it motivates a lot of people.

08:04.000 --&gt; 08:06.000
Yeah.

08:06.000 --&gt; 08:08.000
Regarding motivation, how did you start

08:08.000 --&gt; 08:10.000
to contribute to Sierra A.D.

08:10.000 --&gt; 08:12.000
Empire's Ascent?

08:12.000 --&gt; 08:16.000
It's actually like not a funny story.

08:16.000 --&gt; 08:20.000
I was working for Moots

08:20.000 --&gt; 08:22.000
on another game called

08:22.000 --&gt; 08:24.000
Intent Blade Warp End,

08:24.000 --&gt; 08:26.000
which is a game where you play

08:26.000 --&gt; 08:28.000
a strategic map

08:28.000 --&gt; 08:30.000
and you try to conquer castle

08:30.000 --&gt; 08:32.000
and you can also play

08:32.000 --&gt; 08:34.000
in first person and, like,

08:34.000 --&gt; 08:36.000
lead the siege to this castle.

08:36.000 --&gt; 08:38.000
It's a pretty nice game.

08:38.000 --&gt; 08:40.000
And what I wanted to do was

08:40.000 --&gt; 08:42.000
learn to do 3D

08:42.000 --&gt; 08:44.000
and, well, 3D art.

08:44.000 --&gt; 08:46.000
And so I went on those forums

08:46.000 --&gt; 08:48.000
and I started, like, making models.

08:48.000 --&gt; 08:50.000
And it didn't go very well.

08:50.000 --&gt; 08:52.000
Like, people were not

08:52.000 --&gt; 08:54.000
really nice to me.

08:54.000 --&gt; 08:56.000
They were pretty

08:56.000 --&gt; 08:58.000
a lot of criticism.

08:58.000 --&gt; 09:00.000
And it was not a really good time

09:00.000 --&gt; 09:02.000
to be around.

09:02.000 --&gt; 09:04.000
I was also really young.

09:04.000 --&gt; 09:06.000
So I didn't, like, quite understand

09:06.000 --&gt; 09:08.000
what was going on.

09:08.000 --&gt; 09:10.000
And I had, like, this

09:10.000 --&gt; 09:12.000
magazine about video games

09:12.000 --&gt; 09:14.000
called

09:14.000 --&gt; 09:16.000
The Video for Uncom.

09:16.000 --&gt; 09:18.000
And it just, like, happened to...

09:18.000 --&gt; 09:20.000
It wasn't a video. It was joystick.

09:20.000 --&gt; 09:22.000
And it just happened that

09:22.000 --&gt; 09:24.000
they were talking about 0.0.

09:24.000 --&gt; 09:26.000
And I was like, okay, what is this?

09:26.000 --&gt; 09:28.000
Like, let's try it out.

09:28.000 --&gt; 09:30.000
I ran the game the first time

09:30.000 --&gt; 09:32.000
and it crashed.

09:32.000 --&gt; 09:34.000
And, like, let go for a bit of time.

09:34.000 --&gt; 09:36.000
And then I went back

09:36.000 --&gt; 09:38.000
and tried to do 3D.

09:38.000 --&gt; 09:40.000
And people would just, like,

09:40.000 --&gt; 09:42.000
a bit nicer to me there.

09:42.000 --&gt; 09:44.000
So I would just, like, go

09:44.000 --&gt; 09:46.000
and try to make new models.

09:46.000 --&gt; 09:48.000
For the game.

09:48.000 --&gt; 09:50.000
So in case, people are not aware.

09:50.000 --&gt; 09:52.000
There are a lot of modes for 0.0.

09:52.000 --&gt; 09:54.000
Because, yeah, the game itself

09:54.000 --&gt; 09:56.000
is a mode for the engine.

09:56.000 --&gt; 09:58.000
So you can, like, to design anything you want.

09:58.000 --&gt; 10:00.000
There is a mode for

10:00.000 --&gt; 10:02.000
Hyrule Conquest, which is a Zelda

10:02.000 --&gt; 10:04.000
Samt word.

10:04.000 --&gt; 10:05.000
There are, like, ponies

10:05.000 --&gt; 10:07.000
ascendant, which is, like, my little pony

10:07.000 --&gt; 10:09.000
in the game.

10:09.000 --&gt; 10:10.000
There are modes

10:10.000 --&gt; 10:12.000
about medieval periods.

10:12.000 --&gt; 10:14.000
There are modes about the American revolution.

10:14.000 --&gt; 10:16.000
There are modes about pirates.

10:16.000 --&gt; 10:19.000
Ancient civilization

10:19.000 --&gt; 10:21.000
before the time frame of the radio.

10:21.000 --&gt; 10:23.000
There are a lot of things like this.

10:23.000 --&gt; 10:25.000
So I started doing two modes.

10:25.000 --&gt; 10:27.000
Like, one was called Millennium AD.

10:27.000 --&gt; 10:29.000
Which is, well, medieval period.

10:29.000 --&gt; 10:34.000
Like, 500 AD to 1080.

10:34.000 --&gt; 10:36.000
So it was, like, civilization,

10:36.000 --&gt; 10:38.000
like, current engines,

10:38.000 --&gt; 10:40.000
north.

10:40.000 --&gt; 10:42.000
And,

10:43.000 --&gt; 10:45.000
and Anglo-Saxons.

10:45.000 --&gt; 10:47.000
So we started working on that.

10:47.000 --&gt; 10:51.000
And this is how I owned my skills

10:51.000 --&gt; 10:53.000
of 3D and everything.

10:53.000 --&gt; 10:55.000
And after six years.

10:55.000 --&gt; 10:58.000
So I started contributing to 0.0.0 in 2011.

10:58.000 --&gt; 11:01.000
But it took 2017 for me to actually

11:01.000 --&gt; 11:04.000
get recognized and get into the team.

11:04.000 --&gt; 11:06.000
Okay. Oh, I got it for a long time.

11:06.000 --&gt; 11:08.000
Yeah, that was a very long time there.

11:08.000 --&gt; 11:10.000
It's been a lot of frustration in that time

11:10.000 --&gt; 11:12.000
because I was feeling I was not good enough

11:12.000 --&gt; 11:14.000
to do anything for a long time.

11:14.000 --&gt; 11:16.000
And eventually I made it.

11:16.000 --&gt; 11:20.000
And this way I could, like, empower new artists.

11:20.000 --&gt; 11:23.000
Like, get them to do the same way I did.

11:23.000 --&gt; 11:25.000
But maybe faster.

11:25.000 --&gt; 11:27.000
So it wouldn't be as frustrating.

11:27.000 --&gt; 11:28.000
Okay.

11:28.000 --&gt; 11:30.000
Was this also your motivation

11:30.000 --&gt; 11:31.000
then to become part of the leader?

11:31.000 --&gt; 11:33.000
That you want to be able to, like,

11:33.000 --&gt; 11:36.000
get other artists click on board?

11:37.000 --&gt; 11:41.000
It kind of fell on me.

11:41.000 --&gt; 11:44.000
I wasn't, like, planning to do this.

11:44.000 --&gt; 11:47.000
Like, when the former project leader resigned,

11:47.000 --&gt; 11:49.000
I was like, no, this is bad.

11:49.000 --&gt; 11:51.000
Like, I don't want this.

11:51.000 --&gt; 11:54.000
Please don't kill my project.

11:54.000 --&gt; 11:57.000
And it took me quite some time to accept it.

11:57.000 --&gt; 11:58.000
Like, he resigned.

11:58.000 --&gt; 12:01.000
But I don't know, three years ago or something.

12:01.000 --&gt; 12:04.000
And I've only taken title, like,

12:04.000 --&gt; 12:06.000
a few months back.

12:06.000 --&gt; 12:10.000
I didn't feel like I deserved title

12:10.000 --&gt; 12:14.000
or like I was up to the task and everything.

12:14.000 --&gt; 12:18.000
But, yeah, so it wasn't like a choice.

12:18.000 --&gt; 12:20.000
Like, I want to be, I want to be project leader.

12:20.000 --&gt; 12:23.000
It was more of, I don't want my project to die.

12:23.000 --&gt; 12:25.000
And I want to do everything in my power

12:25.000 --&gt; 12:29.000
to keep it alive and keep it bringing

12:29.000 --&gt; 12:33.000
whatever it has brought to me and other people over the years.

12:33.000 --&gt; 12:38.000
So, yeah, I really wanted to make it, well, last longer.

12:38.000 --&gt; 12:41.000
Okay, so you decided to become project leader

12:41.000 --&gt; 12:43.000
or to take on the stuff.

12:43.000 --&gt; 12:45.000
Great responsibility.

12:45.000 --&gt; 12:47.000
Yeah, great power.

12:47.000 --&gt; 12:48.000
Okay.

12:48.000 --&gt; 12:51.000
Would you say there were some modifications

12:51.000 --&gt; 12:55.000
from people contributing to zero AD and per centen,

12:55.000 --&gt; 13:00.000
which are really disliked or which were even against your values?

13:01.000 --&gt; 13:04.000
Yeah, there are a lot of things.

13:04.000 --&gt; 13:06.000
Well, first of all,

13:06.000 --&gt; 13:10.000
history is not really good to women and people of color.

13:10.000 --&gt; 13:15.000
So, sometimes you have to play it on the fine line

13:15.000 --&gt; 13:18.000
between getting things historically accurate

13:18.000 --&gt; 13:21.000
and being like really bad,

13:21.000 --&gt; 13:23.000
well, having like really bad teachers

13:23.000 --&gt; 13:26.000
because to justify something.

13:26.000 --&gt; 13:28.000
For instance, for a long while,

13:28.000 --&gt; 13:32.000
women would just boost males in their area

13:32.000 --&gt; 13:34.000
because they were females,

13:34.000 --&gt; 13:37.000
which is, well, a bit preposterous.

13:37.000 --&gt; 13:40.000
So, this was one of the things that was removed

13:40.000 --&gt; 13:43.000
like in 2004, which took a long time

13:43.000 --&gt; 13:45.000
because it has been like,

13:45.000 --&gt; 13:47.000
it had been there forever.

13:47.000 --&gt; 13:51.000
There are some features about gameplay,

13:51.000 --&gt; 13:55.000
about that are not like liked.

13:55.000 --&gt; 13:58.000
So, to give a little bit of context,

13:58.000 --&gt; 14:04.000
Alpha 24 came out two years after Alpha 23,

14:04.000 --&gt; 14:07.000
which means during that time,

14:07.000 --&gt; 14:10.000
a lot of things changed inside the team

14:10.000 --&gt; 14:13.000
and inside the game,

14:13.000 --&gt; 14:16.000
meaning a lot of new features were added

14:16.000 --&gt; 14:19.000
but not tested or changed

14:19.000 --&gt; 14:21.000
or things were cleaned up,

14:21.000 --&gt; 14:23.000
made more historically accurate,

14:23.000 --&gt; 14:25.000
added and everything.

14:25.000 --&gt; 14:28.000
And so, when Alpha 24 came out,

14:28.000 --&gt; 14:30.000
it was a complete different game.

14:30.000 --&gt; 14:32.000
It stayed the same,

14:32.000 --&gt; 14:34.000
like the bassist was the same,

14:34.000 --&gt; 14:36.000
but the game played a lot differently.

14:36.000 --&gt; 14:38.000
And so, people were not used to it

14:38.000 --&gt; 14:40.000
and they got pretty angry at it.

14:40.000 --&gt; 14:42.000
We got a lot of answers,

14:42.000 --&gt; 14:44.000
we got a lot of threads created on the forums

14:44.000 --&gt; 14:46.000
about how we did wrong

14:46.000 --&gt; 14:48.000
and we butchered the game

14:48.000 --&gt; 14:50.000
and stuff like this.

14:50.000 --&gt; 14:53.000
Yeah, it wasn't a really good time to be around.

14:53.000 --&gt; 14:56.000
Oh my gosh, that sounds very horrible.

14:56.000 --&gt; 14:59.000
Yeah, and I mean, it's fine.

14:59.000 --&gt; 15:01.000
You can be angry about your favorite game,

15:01.000 --&gt; 15:03.000
like being changed.

15:03.000 --&gt; 15:05.000
But I think a lot of people forget

15:05.000 --&gt; 15:08.000
that we're just doing this on a free time,

15:08.000 --&gt; 15:13.000
and well, motivation doesn't come naturally.

15:13.000 --&gt; 15:16.000
You have to work for it sometimes,

15:16.000 --&gt; 15:19.000
like if you have stuff to do that needs to be done

15:19.000 --&gt; 15:20.000
but you don't want to do it.

15:20.000 --&gt; 15:23.000
Like, this is where it starts lacking the most.

15:23.000 --&gt; 15:25.000
Like, everybody's insulting you,

15:25.000 --&gt; 15:27.000
but you know, you need to do things

15:27.000 --&gt; 15:29.000
to get things rolling again.

15:29.000 --&gt; 15:32.000
It's really hard to get the motivation you need.

15:32.000 --&gt; 15:35.000
But how do you get your motivation to work for,

15:35.000 --&gt; 15:36.000
in your free time,

15:36.000 --&gt; 15:41.000
for a very nice and very beautiful design video game?

15:41.000 --&gt; 15:46.000
I believe it's about doing something greater than myself.

15:46.000 --&gt; 15:49.000
And something else has driven me.

15:49.000 --&gt; 15:52.000
I don't really like doing things for myself only.

15:52.000 --&gt; 15:55.000
I just want to do things that are meaningful to other people.

15:55.000 --&gt; 15:58.000
So I think if that's where I'm drawing my strength,

15:58.000 --&gt; 16:00.000
like from the community,

16:00.000 --&gt; 16:02.000
and the people who enjoy the game,

16:02.000 --&gt; 16:04.000
from the people who you meet at Evans,

16:04.000 --&gt; 16:08.000
and that says, oh, this is the greatest game I've ever played.

16:08.000 --&gt; 16:10.000
I played all the time,

16:10.000 --&gt; 16:12.000
or sometimes I once made a joke

16:12.000 --&gt; 16:14.000
about the game winning his life

16:14.000 --&gt; 16:16.000
and stopped playing it.

16:16.000 --&gt; 16:18.000
But you know, those people,

16:18.000 --&gt; 16:20.000
those people that are really into it,

16:20.000 --&gt; 16:23.000
these are the people we do it for.

16:23.000 --&gt; 16:26.000
And of course, there are some things that are nice.

16:26.000 --&gt; 16:30.000
Like, I don't know why I just enjoy doing art sometimes.

16:30.000 --&gt; 16:32.000
So I would just like stop,

16:32.000 --&gt; 16:33.000
and everything I'm doing

16:33.000 --&gt; 16:35.000
and just make a few icons for the game

16:35.000 --&gt; 16:36.000
and just feel good about them.

16:36.000 --&gt; 16:38.000
And then it gives you a little bit more motivation

16:38.000 --&gt; 16:41.000
to do the boring task you have to do.

16:41.000 --&gt; 16:43.000
I see.

16:43.000 --&gt; 16:45.000
That sounds very nice as well.

16:45.000 --&gt; 16:48.000
I also have another question for

16:48.000 --&gt; 16:50.000
regarding the game in general,

16:50.000 --&gt; 16:52.000
and this would be

16:52.000 --&gt; 16:54.000
more personal kind of question for you,

16:54.000 --&gt; 16:56.000
which is your favorite tribe,

16:56.000 --&gt; 16:59.000
character, or even building in the game?

16:59.000 --&gt; 17:02.000
That's a good question.

17:02.000 --&gt; 17:06.000
Well, I really like one of the building

17:06.000 --&gt; 17:09.000
that was which moved in it for 24.

17:09.000 --&gt; 17:12.000
It was the gold tavern.

17:12.000 --&gt; 17:15.000
Yeah, I really like that building.

17:15.000 --&gt; 17:17.000
But most, I think,

17:17.000 --&gt; 17:19.000
I really like the goals,

17:19.000 --&gt; 17:21.000
the civilization.

17:21.000 --&gt; 17:24.000
Like, it's one of the civilization.

17:24.000 --&gt; 17:26.000
I contributed to the most, I think,

17:26.000 --&gt; 17:27.000
and it's just like,

17:27.000 --&gt; 17:29.000
well, it feels like home, I think.

17:29.000 --&gt; 17:31.000
Ah, okay, very nice.

17:31.000 --&gt; 17:33.000
For me personally, I,

17:33.000 --&gt; 17:35.000
so far, I like the patience the most,

17:35.000 --&gt; 17:36.000
to be honest.

17:36.000 --&gt; 17:37.000
I don't know.

17:37.000 --&gt; 17:40.000
I really like them.

17:40.000 --&gt; 17:42.000
Ah, yeah, well, a lot of civilization.

17:42.000 --&gt; 17:44.000
I think a lot of people consider the versions

17:44.000 --&gt; 17:47.000
to be the one lacking love the most.

17:47.000 --&gt; 17:50.000
We haven't touched them in a while,

17:50.000 --&gt; 17:53.000
and they could probably use some kind of,

17:53.000 --&gt; 17:55.000
like, new models and improvements.

17:55.000 --&gt; 17:57.000
But they're pretty great.

17:57.000 --&gt; 17:59.000
And I was really happy that two contributors

17:59.000 --&gt; 18:03.000
stepped up to do the voices for them.

18:03.000 --&gt; 18:07.000
Ah, okay, so people also contribute

18:07.000 --&gt; 18:11.000
by doing sound samples or stuff like that.

18:11.000 --&gt; 18:14.000
Yeah, you can actually contribute by doing a lot of things.

18:14.000 --&gt; 18:16.000
So you can do 3D art, you can do programming,

18:16.000 --&gt; 18:19.000
you can do social media stuff,

18:19.000 --&gt; 18:21.000
you can do forum moderation,

18:21.000 --&gt; 18:22.000
you can do...

18:22.000 --&gt; 18:24.000
But you can also do sound design,

18:24.000 --&gt; 18:26.000
you can create new sounds for the gaming,

18:26.000 --&gt; 18:28.000
and you can record voices,

18:28.000 --&gt; 18:32.000
so they can be used for civilization.

18:32.000 --&gt; 18:34.000
For those voices,

18:34.000 --&gt; 18:38.000
they also wanted to have them historically accurate.

18:38.000 --&gt; 18:40.000
I mean, as much as possible,

18:40.000 --&gt; 18:42.000
because it's a bit hard to know

18:42.000 --&gt; 18:46.000
someone from 2000 years ago would just speak.

18:46.000 --&gt; 18:49.000
But so, Persians play,

18:49.000 --&gt; 18:52.000
speak some kind of Farsi, I think.

18:52.000 --&gt; 18:56.000
Cushits, I actually did the Cushit voices

18:56.000 --&gt; 18:59.000
with my ex-girlfriend,

18:59.000 --&gt; 19:01.000
and they speak Cushit,

19:01.000 --&gt; 19:03.000
or 80k, whatever.

19:03.000 --&gt; 19:05.000
So, yeah, it's actually like,

19:05.000 --&gt; 19:09.000
somebody did the research and did the phonetics and stuff.

19:09.000 --&gt; 19:13.000
So we could just like pronounce the words like they would.

19:13.000 --&gt; 19:15.000
So we also have Greek and Latin,

19:15.000 --&gt; 19:18.000
and that's about it,

19:18.000 --&gt; 19:22.000
and we hope to be able to add more in the future.

19:22.000 --&gt; 19:26.000
I see you're really, really, historically accurate,

19:26.000 --&gt; 19:30.000
how many people participate in the development of 080?

19:30.000 --&gt; 19:36.000
It's hard to say, because when you say, I don't know, 20 people.

19:36.000 --&gt; 19:41.000
Most people imagine 20 people working on their day job.

19:41.000 --&gt; 19:44.000
So 8 hours per day and everything.

19:44.000 --&gt; 19:45.000
But it's not like that.

19:45.000 --&gt; 19:50.000
So, officially in the team, there are probably 20 people.

19:50.000 --&gt; 19:56.000
But in terms of activity, we're more like two or three people,

19:56.000 --&gt; 20:03.000
like active four hours a day or something, which is like a lot less.

20:03.000 --&gt; 20:07.000
And some people like, yeah, you know, contributing in other ways.

20:07.000 --&gt; 20:11.000
They make videos, they make, or they make content for the game.

20:11.000 --&gt; 20:16.000
And it's hard to keep track of everything they do.

20:16.000 --&gt; 20:20.000
So I'd say the community is probably like 200 people.

20:20.000 --&gt; 20:28.000
But in terms of like actual contribution, like we're more like six, seven people.

20:28.000 --&gt; 20:31.000
So there are like six, seven people that are really focused on the game

20:31.000 --&gt; 20:33.000
and that they do a lot of stuff.

20:33.000 --&gt; 20:36.000
And then there are a lot of people who do small things for the game.

20:36.000 --&gt; 20:38.000
Yeah, I wouldn't say a lot of stuff.

20:38.000 --&gt; 20:43.000
I would say small things and sometimes they get together and do big things.

20:43.000 --&gt; 20:45.000
That's actually my job as project leader.

20:45.000 --&gt; 20:50.000
Like it's to bring people to do something bigger than just like their own part.

20:50.000 --&gt; 20:55.000
In their own area of expertise.

20:55.000 --&gt; 20:59.000
So for example, designing a new tribe or what would be something bigger?

20:59.000 --&gt; 21:01.000
Yeah, that would take a lot of work.

21:01.000 --&gt; 21:10.000
Like you would take someone doing the history, someone doing the arts, someone doing the art assets,

21:10.000 --&gt; 21:15.000
like all the XML files and stuff like you need to get the civilization to the game.

21:15.000 --&gt; 21:21.000
You probably would need 2D artists to do the icons and stuff.

21:21.000 --&gt; 21:28.000
You need maybe sound to add like, I don't know, maybe new animals that fits the civilization.

21:28.000 --&gt; 21:34.000
And there is a lot of where there are a lot of different jobs that you need to concentrate.

21:34.000 --&gt; 21:36.000
But you don't have to get it all at once.

21:36.000 --&gt; 21:42.000
You can just like do the story part first, then do the art, then get it to the game,

21:42.000 --&gt; 21:45.000
and then like do the final touches.

21:45.000 --&gt; 21:47.000
Okay, I see.

21:47.000 --&gt; 21:53.000
Where will you say is the most contribution needed?

21:53.000 --&gt; 22:00.000
I'd say programming is one of the biggest areas.

22:01.000 --&gt; 22:08.000
When people think programmers, they just think about someone getting behind a keyboard and just like typing code.

22:08.000 --&gt; 22:11.000
But there are actually a lot of jobs there.

22:11.000 --&gt; 22:15.000
We have like AI programmers that we work on the AI.

22:15.000 --&gt; 22:20.000
We have random map programmers.

22:20.000 --&gt; 22:23.000
So there are two types of maps in Z-rated.

22:23.000 --&gt; 22:28.000
There are scrimmage maps and scenario maps, but there are the same type.

22:28.000 --&gt; 22:30.000
And there are random maps.

22:30.000 --&gt; 22:35.000
Scrimmage and scenario maps are made by hand.

22:35.000 --&gt; 22:39.000
You just open the map editor in Z-rated and you place things by hand.

22:39.000 --&gt; 22:43.000
And random maps are made using code.

22:43.000 --&gt; 22:50.000
So you just like script, I don't know, getting some data from OpenStreetMap.

22:51.000 --&gt; 22:57.000
And then that gives you the terrain layouts or you just like code all the mountains yourself and everything.

22:57.000 --&gt; 23:00.000
So that's one area of the code you have to do.

23:00.000 --&gt; 23:05.000
There are like graphics programmers, engine programmers.

23:05.000 --&gt; 23:11.000
Then you have like each OS programming, whatever.

23:11.000 --&gt; 23:16.000
So if you're working with macOS, you need to like have someone who actually got a Mac,

23:16.000 --&gt; 23:21.000
which is usually something that doesn't come by often.

23:21.000 --&gt; 23:24.000
So yeah, there is a lot of specificity everywhere.

23:24.000 --&gt; 23:27.000
And we are maintaining the engine and the game.

23:27.000 --&gt; 23:32.000
So then you have the gameplay programmers that only work on like tiny parts of like,

23:32.000 --&gt; 23:36.000
well, you know, where our units interact.

23:36.000 --&gt; 23:39.000
Like someone who would just like do the secondary attacks.

23:39.000 --&gt; 23:43.000
That would be gameplay programmer.

23:43.000 --&gt; 23:46.000
So yeah, so we need a lot of programmers there.

23:46.000 --&gt; 23:50.000
And we usually need like people who have a bit of experience.

23:50.000 --&gt; 23:53.000
Because a few people learned how to code.

23:53.000 --&gt; 23:57.000
I think I sure did through Z-rated.

23:57.000 --&gt; 24:01.000
But at some point at the end of the day, if you only have like junior people,

24:01.000 --&gt; 24:09.000
you just have got a lot of bugs because you're just going to be trying to make sure everyone is doing that job correctly.

24:09.000 --&gt; 24:12.000
And you just have to keep track of everything.

24:12.000 --&gt; 24:17.000
And you don't get senior by just spending five years on the project.

24:17.000 --&gt; 24:22.000
Because if you keep five years doing the same mistakes, then you're not learning anything.

24:22.000 --&gt; 24:30.000
So yeah, it's important to have like people who have actual experience that have worked with other people that have,

24:30.000 --&gt; 24:35.000
well, the do's and don't about programming.

24:35.000 --&gt; 24:37.000
But we also need artists.

24:37.000 --&gt; 24:38.000
We also need historians.

24:38.000 --&gt; 24:42.000
We also need like some designers and stuff like to make new music.

24:42.000 --&gt; 24:46.000
Artists is just about new making new civilization.

24:46.000 --&gt; 24:47.000
Keep the mood alive.

24:47.000 --&gt; 24:54.000
Like make the community grow and show the true power of the engine.

24:54.000 --&gt; 24:59.000
Yeah, and for artists the same, you have like 3D artists.

24:59.000 --&gt; 25:00.000
You have 2D artists.

25:00.000 --&gt; 25:01.000
You have technical artists.

25:01.000 --&gt; 25:06.000
You have well, you have animators, rigors.

25:06.000 --&gt; 25:10.000
Well, a lot of kind of like specificity jobs and the thing.

25:10.000 --&gt; 25:11.000
You can do everything.

25:11.000 --&gt; 25:15.000
But then you just like, like me, you just ran out of time.

25:15.000 --&gt; 25:20.000
I would like to do a bit of a topic speech.

25:20.000 --&gt; 25:22.000
If that's okay with you.

25:22.000 --&gt; 25:30.000
And I would like to talk a bit more about how zero AD empiricism became free software.

25:30.000 --&gt; 25:31.000
Yeah.

25:31.000 --&gt; 25:32.000
Sure.

25:32.000 --&gt; 25:36.000
What was the, I read that it wasn't always free software.

25:36.000 --&gt; 25:38.000
Or published on air free software license?

25:38.000 --&gt; 25:39.000
No.

25:39.000 --&gt; 25:40.000
Okay.

25:40.000 --&gt; 25:42.000
So yeah, no, it wasn't always free software.

25:42.000 --&gt; 25:44.000
At the beginning, I think.

25:44.000 --&gt; 25:49.000
So it started by edge of vampires' motives and edge of vampires' players.

25:49.000 --&gt; 25:57.000
Getting together to make a game that would be different from edge of vampires with less limitations.

25:57.000 --&gt; 26:00.000
And it was like around the early 2000s.

26:00.000 --&gt; 26:05.000
They came together and started designing things like how they wanted it to be.

26:05.000 --&gt; 26:11.000
We still have the document with all the things they designed during that time.

26:11.000 --&gt; 26:14.000
There are historians, there are people interested in the story.

26:14.000 --&gt; 26:19.000
There are programmers, there are a lot of great people at the time.

26:19.000 --&gt; 26:24.000
And so, well, they started working on it as amateurs.

26:24.000 --&gt; 26:28.000
They worked on it for about nine years, like from 2009.

26:28.000 --&gt; 26:31.000
The problem was that when you work for something for so long,

26:31.000 --&gt; 26:34.000
then life starts getting in the way.

26:34.000 --&gt; 26:37.000
A lot of people came and went.

26:37.000 --&gt; 26:39.000
People got married.

26:39.000 --&gt; 26:41.000
People died too.

26:41.000 --&gt; 26:46.000
One of the original founders died to cancer in 2006.

26:46.000 --&gt; 26:53.000
And so, well, the focus shifted for a lot of people during their own lives.

26:53.000 --&gt; 27:01.000
And they ended up realizing that they could not bring their dream to be real in the current state.

27:01.000 --&gt; 27:05.000
So they said, what if we make it open source?

27:05.000 --&gt; 27:07.000
Maybe people would be interested.

27:07.000 --&gt; 27:14.000
And maybe we can continue to, I don't know, like, yeah, make it better.

27:14.000 --&gt; 27:18.000
And it worked because like 10 years later, I'm still there.

27:18.000 --&gt; 27:25.000
I only joined in 2011, so I wasn't there at the time of the open source thing of the game.

27:25.000 --&gt; 27:28.000
The release, as some people say.

27:28.000 --&gt; 27:35.000
So yeah, they decided to make it open source for that reason, to keep it alive, I think.

27:35.000 --&gt; 27:39.000
The more information can be found on the website.

27:39.000 --&gt; 27:44.000
Okay, do you know if the migration, thank you very much for this quick recap.

27:44.000 --&gt; 27:52.000
Do you know how the migration process went, like, better any hurdles, or did it all that very smoothly?

27:52.000 --&gt; 28:03.000
I don't think it was that hard, but it must have been easy either, because they had like assets that were proprietary,

28:03.000 --&gt; 28:08.000
that they had to replace or buy licenses to be able to use them.

28:08.000 --&gt; 28:13.000
Because as soon as you make everything open source, like, it gets open source forever,

28:13.000 --&gt; 28:19.000
and you can't, like, deprive somebody from their artistic rights and stuff like this.

28:19.000 --&gt; 28:25.000
It, it depends on the country, but in, for instance, in France, like, if I make an art piece,

28:25.000 --&gt; 28:28.000
I cannot concede all my rights to it.

28:28.000 --&gt; 28:30.000
I'm not allowed by the law.

28:30.000 --&gt; 28:37.000
I can, like, at any time, like, revoke the rights to it, because I'm the sole creator.

28:37.000 --&gt; 28:42.000
And it, it depends on the legislation in the, in the country.

28:42.000 --&gt; 28:45.000
So they probably had, like, some troubles with that.

28:45.000 --&gt; 28:50.000
Then you need to get all the contributors that contributed for nine years to accept,

28:50.000 --&gt; 28:58.000
to release their work, kind of for free, like, and to allow people to edit, modify, and change things.

28:58.000 --&gt; 29:05.000
So it might have taken a long time to get everyone up to speed and to agree to things.

29:05.000 --&gt; 29:11.000
Okay. So it did take at some times, but you wouldn't say there'd ever any big hurdles.

29:11.000 --&gt; 29:14.000
No.

29:14.000 --&gt; 29:22.000
What would you say is the main advantage of developing a free software game?

29:22.000 --&gt; 29:27.000
I'd say it's the possibilities.

29:27.000 --&gt; 29:34.000
If you develop a commercial game, then you have to please the shareholders.

29:34.000 --&gt; 29:39.000
You have to reason time. You have to do things that will work.

29:39.000 --&gt; 29:45.000
Whereas we can just, like, break everything, because just test things, see if that work doesn't.

29:45.000 --&gt; 29:55.000
It does know we have no, like, restrictions on what we can do.

29:55.000 --&gt; 30:03.000
Yeah, it's just, like, we're free to do whatever we want, but the price is only time.

30:03.000 --&gt; 30:09.000
Because at the end of the day, you still have to invest in time. You want to be able to do things.

30:09.000 --&gt; 30:13.000
Okay. So you would say it's like you have to sortistic freedom.

30:13.000 --&gt; 30:17.000
Yeah. It's a, it's a, it's a crazy, it's a crazy freedom.

30:17.000 --&gt; 30:22.000
Like, as I said, there was, there are so many modes about the game, like, you can work on any of them,

30:22.000 --&gt; 30:27.000
you can even make them the main game you want to. Like, everything's possible.

30:27.000 --&gt; 30:33.000
Okay. Then I would come to my last question.

30:33.000 --&gt; 30:38.000
This has sadly nothing to do with zero AD anymore.

30:38.000 --&gt; 30:43.000
Every year on the 14th of February, the FSFE organizes the ILOF free software day,

30:43.000 --&gt; 30:48.000
as you have probably heard, because we are producing this podcast for the ILOF free software day.

30:48.000 --&gt; 30:55.000
And the ILOF free software day is a chance to say, thank you to contributors to free software projects

30:55.000 --&gt; 31:00.000
and yeah, to say, thank you for their work and their contribution.

31:00.000 --&gt; 31:05.000
And my question is, who would you like to say thank you to?

31:05.000 --&gt; 31:11.000
Well, so that's easy. I'd like to thank the free software foundationer for letting me do this podcast.

31:11.000 --&gt; 31:22.000
But yeah, I'd like to thank mostly all the people who created theory for giving me such a great hobby.

31:22.000 --&gt; 31:29.000
And I'd like to do like this. This is really cool.

31:29.000 --&gt; 31:35.000
And yeah, so yeah, I'd like to thank all the people I'm working with right now for zero AD,

31:35.000 --&gt; 31:40.000
because it wouldn't be possible without you either.

31:40.000 --&gt; 31:41.000
Thank you, Sven.

31:41.000 --&gt; 31:42.000
You're welcome.

31:42.000 --&gt; 31:49.000
And thank you for your time. It was really nice having you as a guest for the ILOF free software day podcast episode.

31:49.000 --&gt; 31:52.000
I hope I will talk to you in the future again.

31:52.000 --&gt; 31:56.000
Me too. Maybe you will meet someday. I don't know.

31:56.000 --&gt; 31:58.000
