	<center><h2>The GNU has come of age</h2></center>

        <p>The french chapter of the FSF Europe wishes to celebrate in
        this very year 2001 the coming of age of the GNU project on
        September the 27th.</p>

	<p>Although the GNU project was mature long before being 18
	years old, we must remember the date which changed history
	somehow : the <a
	href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html">anouncement</a>
	of its creation by Richard Stallman on 27 of September
	1983. It's gonna be 18 years ago this year 2001.</p>

	<p>We invite all members of the free software community to
	celebrate the best way. We invite people in Paris to join at
	the Hall's Beer Tavern, 68 rue Saint Denis (Paris) begining at
	19H00, on thursday 27 september 2001.</p>
