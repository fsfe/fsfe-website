    <h1>The Legal Network Council</h1>

    <!-- What -->
    <p>
      The Council of the Legal Network assists the FSFE with managing
      the Legal Network by providing the advice of expert members. It
      operates with a collaborative attitude and takes into account
      input from various sources, including interested parties,
      prominent members, and the FSFE. The Council is consulted on the
      prospective evolution of the Legal Network and operates as an
      advisory board for the decisions taken by the FSFE.
