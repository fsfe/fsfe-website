         Launch of the <b>&quot;We speak about Free
         Software&quot;</b> campaign: There are compelling reasons to
         think and speak about Free Software and its philosophy. It 
         is rather common knowledge this applies to society as a
         whole, but it has not yet been widely understood that it
         benefits companies, as well. Therefore the FSF Europe launches
         this campaign on behalf and with support of several Free
         Software companies.
