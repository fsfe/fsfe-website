    <title>Fellowship Meeting in Berlin, Germany</title>
    <body>
      <p>
For this year's last Berlin Fellowship meeting, we've prepared something
special for all Fellows and friends: We'll meet at the Emmaus Church near
Goerlitzer Bahnhof to enjoy a talk by Volker Grabsch. Volker, having 100
CACert Assurance Points, gives us insights on daily security using encryption,
key-signing and certificates!</p>
<p>Also, there's going to be a nice retrospective about the Free Software
Year 2012. If this is still not enough: Free Gluehwein for everyone! As always, you'll find <a href="http://grical.org/e/show/1917/">more details about the location and time at GriCal</a>.
