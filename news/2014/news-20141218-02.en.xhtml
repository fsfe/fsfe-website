<p newsteaser="yes"> We shape tomorrow's world by what we do today. FSFE helps people to
  understand how technology affects their rights and freedoms, and
  empowers them to determine their own path in the digital world. See
  what we achieved in 2014, and where we're going next!</p>


<blockquote><p>Free Software has never been more necessary to
    journalists and activists throughout the world. FSFE helps shape a
    world where technology empowers us, instead of oppressing
    us. </p>
    <cite>– Amaelle Guiton, journalist on hacker culture and privacy</cite></blockquote>

<p>I would like to share with you an overview of the work we did
  during the year of 2014. The support of FSFE's Fellows and donors
  has let us reach more people than ever before, and has allowed us to
  make an important impact. It has also allowed us to invest time and
  effort into making FSFE more effective. Importantly in a time of
  countless industry front groups, their contributions have helped to
  keep FSFE the way we like it: Fiercely independent and oriented
  towards the long term.
</p>
 
<p>Please enjoy our annual overview. Thank you for helping us make the
  world a better place!</p>

<h2 id="telling-the-world-about-free-software">Telling the world about
  Free Software</h2>

<p>Getting the Free Software message to as many people as possible is
  one of the main things we do at FSFE. Working with FSFE's Fellows,
  friends, and allies, we help people understand how software freedom
  lets them take charge of the technology in their lives.</p>

<p>FSFE's Fellows are great ambassadors for software freedom. The
 Zurich Fellowship group really came alive this year. The group
 published a detailed position paper on the ability of Swiss public
 bodies to distribute Free Software, and set up a version of the Free
 Software pact campaign for local elections. These volunteers
 established a country team in Switzerland that on their own Free
  Software Pact and outreaches into the public for the OpenJustitia
  case.</p>

<p>Another team of Fellows got together to form a country team in the
Netherlands which runs privacy cafes, booths at events, and boosts
local Fellowship engagement.</p>

<p>For this
year's <em><a href="http://documentfreedom.org/news/2014/news-20140424-01.en.html">Document
Freedom Day</a></em> campaign, we worked with volunteers around the
world to explain and promote Open Standards at 51 events in 21
  countries.</p>

<p>In Munich, Germany, the local Fellowship group had a big media
impact during the local elections in Munich this year, working to
secure the city's use of Free Software amid political change. The
group continues to closely follow the political process, and to build
resistance in the city administration to the aggressive lobbying of
some proprietary vendors.</p>

<p><strong>Events and conferences</strong> are still the single best venue to
establish personal links with people who might be interested in Free
Software. We explained Free Software in talks, workshops, panel
discussions, radio shows and several times on TV. For many of these
events, FSFE's Fellows took charge of organising our participation and
staffing the booth. In addition to the usual IT conferences and
events, we expanded our reach to cover street festivals in Munich and
Düsseldorf (Germany), as well as festivals and game conferences in
Vienna. This new outreach angle worked well, and we want to be present
at many other such events next year.</p>

<p>Quite frequently, these events are also an opportunity for people
to seek FSFE's help and support with moving their own organisations
along the path to Free Software. In this way, we helped the protestant
church in the German Rhineland
to <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/gerloff/2014/06/30/free-software-in-the-church-from-principles-to-practice/">build
Free Software into its IT strategy</a>, and are currently engaged in a
similar conversation with the European Commission and the European
  Parliament.</p>

<p>Of course, we don't just rely on campaigns and events. We spread
the word about Free Software every day, and help others do the
same. Often, our wonderful team of translators helps us do this in
local languages. During 2014, our monthly newsletter was translated
into six languages on average. The same volunteers help us make FSFE's
website available in up to 30 languages.</p>

<p>People who want to talk about Free Software to their friends and
neighbours can order information packs through our website. We are
currently sending out ten packs per month on average. People can order
these free of
charge <a href="http://fsfe.org/contribute/spreadtheword.html#promo-material">through
our website</a>, though of course we appreciate donations to cover
printing and shipping costs. Both our introductory Free Software
leaflet and our F-Droid leaflet are available in five languages. We
recently added a flyer on “email self defence” in German and
English (more languages will be available soon); demand for this has
been so great that we have already done three print runs of
this. Volunteers distributed this flyer at the premiere screenings of
the movie “Citizenfour”.</p>


<h2 id="changing-the-rules">Changing the rules</h2>

<p>Governments make the rules. By working with politicians and
administrators, FSFE makes sure that laws and institutions put human
rights and freedoms first.</p>

<p>For the European elections in May 2014, we helped the French Free
Software association April with the
<em><a href="http://freesoftwarepact.eu">Free Software Pact</a></em>. We
invited candidates in those elections to sign the pact, asking them to
commit to using their European Parliament mandate to promote Free
Software. Many of FSFE's Fellows got in touch with the candidates in
their area to ask them. 33 of the pact's signatories are currently
serving as Members of the European Parliament. We will repeat this
effort for other elections. Preparations are currently under way for
Switzerland's 2015 elections. With more resources available, we could
put more time into following up with signatories, and using the
contact we've built through the campaign to let them know what they
should do in order to improve the situation for Free Software.</p>

<p>In order to put users in charge of their devices, we kept pushing
  on “<em>trusted computing</em>” and
  “<em><a href="https://fsfe.org/campaigns/generalpurposecomputing/secure-boot-analysis.de.html">SecureBoot</a></em>”. We
  brought this issue with Germany's Federal Information Security
  Office, and to the ministries of economics and interior. At the EU
  level, we initiated conversations about alternatives such as
  CoreBoot. We are pushing to ensure that consumers have the
  possibility to install alternative operating systems on the devices
  they buy and own. Our goal is to use the progress we have made in
  Germany to create progress in other European countries, and finally
  put device owners in full control of their hard- and software.</p>




<p>On <em>public procurement</em>, we pushed hard for the European
  Commission to improve the way it acquires software, in order to open
  up opportunities for Free Software and Open Standards. Using the
  EU's
  “<a href="http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/extending_or_replacing_ecs_contr">freedom
    of information</a>” mechanism, as well as parliamentary
  questions, we got the Commission to
  release <a href="http://download.fsfe.org/policy/procurement/">documents</a>
  about the way its contracts with Microsoft and other providers of
  non-free software are structured. We also obtained a document
  outlining the EC's [desktop software strategy] [pdf] for the coming
  years. This effort has opened the doors to several meetings with
  high-level IT decision makers in the Commission and the Parliament,
  and has enabled us to start a constructive conversation with them
  about what steps to take next. For example, the Commission has asked
  us to provide input to the next version of its “open source
  strategy”.</p>

<p>The router that connects your home to the Internet should be under
  your control. That's why we have followed developments on the issue
  of <em>compulsory routers</em>. We have published position papers,
  and documented
  both <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/routers/routers.html">the
    arguments</a> and
  the <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/routers/timeline.html">process</a>
  in German, English, and Dutch. We supported other organisations with
  arguments and technical expertise, such as the Federation of German
  Consumer Organisations. Germany's ministry of economics is currently
  working on a draft law to enable free router choice for consumers,
  and prohibit compulsory routers.</p>

<h2 id="our-free-software-legal-work">Our Free Software legal
  work</h2>

<p>Freedom faces many challenges. FSFE builds networks among the
  people who can do most to break down the barriers on the way to a
  free society.</p>

<p>We facilitate the world's largest network of legal experts on Free
  Software, with currently more than 360 members (up from 320 last
  year). Participating experts come from a wide range of backgrounds,
  from corporate legal departments to lawyers in private practice, and
  engineers with legal skills. The network serves to develop and
  spread best practices around Free Software, and increase
  acceptance. Several participants have called the network's annual
  meeting, the Free Software Legal &amp; Licensing Workshop, the best
  event of its kind in the world.</p>

<div class="captioned">

</div>


<p>This year, we
  also <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2014/news-20140314-01.en.html">launched</a>
  the Asian Legal Network as a discussion forum specifically targeted
  at the companies in that region, which make most of the world's
  computing hardware and embedded devices. Run jointly with the Open
  Invention Network and the Linux Foundation, this group is intended
  to help those companies join the global conversation on Free
  Software best practices, and assist them in improving license
  compliance.</p>

<p>FSFE's <a href="http://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/ftf.en.html">legal
    team</a> again handled several dozen inquiries from developers and
  companies about copyright, licensing, trademarks, patents, and many
  other aspects of Free Software. Our legal coordinator Matija Šuklje
  also answered lots of in-person questions at conferences and events,
  as well as at Ljubljana's CyberPipe hackerspace, where he works one
  day a week.</p>

<h2 id="making-fsfe-better">Making FSFE better</h2>

<p>This year, we set aside some time to review FSFE's goals, and the
  ways in which we pursue them. We conducted a stakeholder survey to
  learn more about the people who take an interest in FSFE, talked to
  many of our friends and allies in person about FSFE's work and
  direction, and reviewed our activities.</p>

<p>With a small group of internal and external experts, we hammered
  out a better way to explain FSFE's purpose that concisely reflects
  the direction we want the organisation to take for the coming
  years. This was an intense and highly productive internal
  process. The results will become visible over time, as FSFE's edge
  grows sharper, and we become more effective than we already are.</p>

<h2 id="fsfes-finances">FSFE's finances</h2>

<p>This section is based on our financial results at the end of Q3
  2014. FSFE's information for previous financial years
  is <a href="https://fsfe.org/about/funds/index.en.html">available
    online</a>. We will post the final numbers for 2014 as soon as
  they become available.</p>

<h3 id="where-fsfes-funds-come-from">Where FSFE's funds come from</h3>

<p>FSFE has an annual budget of roughly 400,000 Euro. 35% of this is
  covered by Fellowship contributions. 25% is covered by sponsoring
  for specific activities (mostly the
  annual <a href="http://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/legal-conference.html">Free
    Software Legal &amp; Licensing Workshop</a>,
  and <a href="http://documentfreedom.org">Document Freedom
    Day</a>). 20% comes from three big donors (Google, Linuxhotel and
  Red Hat), and 15% from smaller corporate or private donations
  (see <a href="https://fsfe.org/donate/thankgnus.html">our list of
    donors</a>. The rest comes from sources such as merchandise sales,
  speaker fees and so on.</p>

<p>75% of FSFE's income is unrestricted, while 25% are tied to
  specific purposes -- mostly the sponsoring mentioned above.</p>

<div class="captioned">

</div>


<p>In sum, roughly half of FSFE's funds come from a limited number of
  large <a href="https://fsfe.org/donate/thankgnus.html">donors</a>
  and sponsors (and let's not forget
  our <a href="https://fsfe.org/donate/hardware.html">hardware
    donors</a>). The other half comes from countless small
  contributions from individuals and companies, in particular through
  the Fellowship. Fellowship contributions have shown reliable and
  constant growth, increasing by 164% since 2010. This is great, since
  they are the bedrock of FSFE's financial independence. In effect,
  they put us in the wonderful position to pursue our work for freedom
  without being worrying whether our initiatives might annoy our large
  donors.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-spend-the-money">How we spend the money</h3>

<p>This section is based on
  our <a href="https://fsfe.org/about/funds/2013.en.html">financial
    results for 2013</a>. We will publish the figures for 2014 as soon
  as they become available; the distribution of costs across different
  categories is going to be similar to the 2013 results.</p>

<p>Across nearly all categories, our largest cost factor are staff
  salaries. We have a great team of experienced and dedicated people,
  and by paying them a living wage, we make it possible for them to
  dedicate their working time to Free Software.</p>

<p>The largest cost center is public awareness, where we spent 30% of
  our funds in 2013. Most of this went into staff salaries for
  campaigns and general public awareness work. The rest paid for
  FSFE's participation in events (mostly travel-related costs) and
  informationation materials.</p>

<p>About 22% of our spending went to FSFE's legal work. We used this
  to pay the salary of our legal coordinator, and travel to
  legal-related events. A large chunk of our spending in this category
  went towards organising the annual conference of the Legal Network;
  we cover the cost of these events through sponsoring and ticket
  sales.</p>

<p>Roughly 13% of our 2013 spending went towards the
  Fellowship. Again, most of this was for the salaries of our staff
  that support the Fellows in being effective ambassadors for Free
  Software. We also organised a meeting of European coordinators that
  year (to be repeated in 2015), and made money available for local
  activities by Fellowship groups.</p>

<p>Pretty much exactly the same share of spending went to FSFE's
  policy work. Here, the cost structure is very simple. Nearly all of
  the funds we spend on policy work go towards staff salaries. Most of
  the rest serves to cover travel costs for policy work, with Brussels
  as the most frequent destination.</p>

<p>About two percent of our costs in 2013 were for merchandise,
  covering mostly production (buying) costs and staff time. Of course,
  these costs were more than covered by the money we made selling said
  merchandise.</p>

<p>About 20% of our costs (19.2% in 2013, to be exact) are overhead
  spending, covering personnel costs for management and
  administration, team meetings (we are a pretty distributed
  organisation), rent for office space, phone bills, and so
  forth. We're trying hard to keep the overhead rate low; but there's
  no escaping the fact that an organisation like FSFE needs some level
  of management and coordination in order to remain effective.</p>

<h2 id="whats-ahead-in-2015">What's ahead in 2015</h2>

<p>During the coming months, the new <em>European Commission</em> will
  set the direction of its work for the next five years. During the
  past year, we have built a number of high-level connections in the
  Commission and the Parliament, and we are itching to leverage
  these. In addition, we are currently receiving numerous inquiries
  from Commission staff with whom we have built long-standing
  relationships, and who currently see open doors for Free Software in
  Brussels.</p>

<p>It is important that we can intensify our work as soon as possible,
  and take advantage of this opportunity to improve the situation for
  Free Software and Open Standards at the EU level. Software
  procurement, standardisation, patents, and device sovereignty are
  core topics for our policy work.</p>

<p>We want to <em>reach more people</em>, and go to more places where
  people do not yet know about Free Software. This is why we will
  further strengthen FSFE's network of local volunteers and Fellowship
  groups. In 2015, we plan to be present at street festivals and other
  events where until now, nobody has been promoting Free Software. We
  have greatly improved our leaflets, stickers, and other printed
  information materials over the past year. Now we will translate it
  into more languages, and expand its distribution libraries, cinemas,
  shops, and other places.</p>

<p>In the long run, we want to make sure that anyone who hears about
  Free Software in Europe can easily find a knowledgeable person close
  to them to help them along their path. That's why we will focus
  on <em>supporting local activities</em> in various ways. We're
  preparing a workshop for the European coordinators of FSFE's
  volunteer teams, in order to help them and their teams become more
  effective activists. We will enable activists to visit Fellowship
  groups in other places, teach their skills, and share their
  experiences. And we will make our promotion materials available in
  even more languages.</p>

<p>As we prepare to take on these challenges, we are grateful for the
  huge support we are experiencing, and for our Fellows' unrelenting passion for freedom!</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />
  Karsten Gerloff <br />
  President, Free Software Foundation Europe
