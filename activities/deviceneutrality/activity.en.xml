    <title>Device Neutrality</title>
    <description>
      Although digital devices are ubiquotous today, the number of devices on which users
      cannot run Free Software is exponentially increasing. The consequence is an increased
      loss of control over usersâ€™ technology. Device Neutrality aims to
      enable end-users to bypass gatekeepers to have a non-discriminatory use of
      Free Software on their devices.
