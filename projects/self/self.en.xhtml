    <p>
      SELF, an acronym for Science, Education and Learning in Freedom, is a
      research project formed by seven international partners and sponsored for
      a two year period by the European Commission.  The partners of the
      project are Internet Society Netherlands (ISOC.NL), Universitat Oberta de
      Catalunya (UOC), Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), University of
      Gothenburg (UG), Internet Society Bulgaria (ISOC.BG), Fundación Vía Libre
      (FVL) and Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE), which are
      settled in Holland, Spain, Europe, Sweden, Bulgaria, Argentina and India,
      respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      The SELF project  will create an online environment for the collaborative
      creation and sharing of educational materials, and will do so by creating
      the web platform necessary for this kind of collaboration, and
      demonstrate its use by collecting and putting educational materials on
      Free Software and Open Standards into use on the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform itself will support common operations such as the merging of
      learning materials, reuse, adaptation, editing as well as collecting
      learning materials into forms useful for specific courses. It will also
      provide the necessary tools for the translation of materials into other
      languages, and the use of materials in many different forms, such as
      course texts, presentations, e-learning programmes, e-books, educational
      audio and video, manuals and reference materials.
    </p>

    <h3>FSFE Contributions</h3>

    <p>
      One seminal role of the FSFE inside the SELF project is to take care of
      all legal issues that may arise, as well as to form the Legal Expert
      Group to handle such regularly arising issues such as new licenses and
      legal maintainability of the platform. The legal work of the FSFE in the
      SELF project is done by our
      <a href="/projects/ftf/">Freedom Task Force</a>.
