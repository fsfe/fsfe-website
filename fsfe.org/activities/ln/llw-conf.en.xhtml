      <h3><strong>About the Legal and Licensing Workshop</strong></h3>

    <p> This event has become the world’s foremost
      gathering of lawyers, technologists, and thought leaders on Free
      Software legal and licensing topics. With up to three days of
      talks in an informal and confidential atmosphere, the Workshop
      advances the state of the art of knowledge on topics ranging from
      license compliance to patent management, from project governance
      to corporate responsibility and even further to the cutting edge
      issues themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participation in the LLW provides legal professionals not only
      the opportunity to share knowledge and updates on the topics they
      are working on, but also a chance to meet and get acquainted with
      each other. These two aspects, combined, foster better license
      compliance by spreading best practices. The conference also
      provides a forum for different professionals to better understand
      each other, thus reducing the overall friction in the sector.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participation in the LLW is open to all Legal Network members.
      Invitations might be extended to non-members. If you think you
      might qualify, please send an e-mail directly to the Legal
      Coordinator, or to <a href="/contact/">our contact address</a>.
