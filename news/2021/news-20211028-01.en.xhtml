  <p>
	  &quot;Software Freedom in Europe&quot; is the yearly report of the Free 
	  Software Foundation Europe e.V. (FSFE). Here you can have an 
	  overview of our work and achievements during the past year.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	  As explained below by Matthias Kirschner, President of the FSFE, our work covers three areas: Policy Advocacy, Legal area, and Public Awareness.

<h2>Summary</h2>
    
  <p>
	Cancelling of large events, limitations in meetings, and travel 
	restrictions: none of this stopped the FSFE from advancing Software 
	Freedom in 2021. From giving online 'Public Money? Public Code!' 
	workshops to volunteers, to organising an online Legal and 
	Licensing Workshop for legal experts, we kept empowering the Free 
	Software community. We assisted software projects become REUSE 
	compliant with our new initiative, REUSE Booster.
  </p>

  <p>
	We created an interactive map to demonstrate the developments of 
	Router Freedom rights in Europe. And we defined sustainable 
	software, presenting suggestions and demands to support it. 
	Meanwhile, a two-year court case initiated by FSFE supporter Luca 
	Bonissi successfully came to an end, unequivocally recognising the 
	right to a Windows licence refund. Overall, significant 
	accomplishments for Software Freedom marked 2021, the year FSFE is 
	celebrating its 20th anniversary.

 <h3 id="20-years-fsfe">Celebrating 20 Years FSFE</h3>

  <p>
	   Long before the first smartphone was introduced, it was evident 
	   to the FSFE's founders that it is the people who should be in 
	   control of technology and not vice versa. In 2001, Free Software 
	   experts around Europe therefore created the Free Software 
	   Foundation Europe. In 2021, the <strong> Free Software Foundation Europe 
	   turns 20</strong>. This means two decades of empowering users to control 
	   technology. Two decades of helping individuals and organisations 
	   to understand how Free Software contributes to freedom, 
	   transparency, and self-determination.

		Hello FSFE, and congratulations from the year 2041 on your 
		forty years of fighting for the digital rights of Europeans and 
		of all people in all places! — Cory Doctorow
	</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p>
	  The FSFE was founded in <a 
	  href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2001q2/000003.html">April 
	  2001</a>, so in April 2021 we started having a look <a 
	  href="/activities/20years/20years.html">at our community and 
	  previous work</a>. We contacted people who paved the way of the 
	  FSFE since its beginning, such as long term volunteers and past 
	  staffers. So far we interviewed <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210204-01.html">Georg Greve</a>, <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210625-01.html">Torsten Grote</a>, <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210305-01.html">Reinhard Müller</a>, <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210420-01.html">Fernanda Weiden</a>, and 
	  we received a video message from Cory <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210529-01.html">Doctorow</a>. We shared 
	  the FSFE <a 
	  href="/activities/20years/20years.html#Highlights-from-the-last-20-years">highlights 
	  from the last 20 years</a>, and Matthias Kirschner <a 
	  href="https://peertube.social/videos/watch/1fd019fd-2fcf-4777-8b3a-59ac647ab542">presented</a> 
	  the work of the organisation since its founding.
  </p>  

<h2 id="1-pmpc">1. Public Money? Public Code!</h2>

<h3 id="public-health-apps">Demanding Free Software in Public Health related apps</h3>

  <p>
	  Amid the difficulties of the pandemic, the FSFE identifies a 
	  crucial aspect; that apps related to public health should be Free 
	  Software. This way they will be transparent, trustworthy, and 
	  available to people who consciously avoid proprietary software. 
	  Throughout this challenge <a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20200402-02.html">our demands are 
	  consistent</a>, and this is reflected in our work. In December of 
	  2020, the FSFE stood in favour of coronavirus tracing apps to be 
	  Free Software and thanked the volunteers who <a 
	  href="https://codeberg.org/corona-contact-tracing-germany/cwa-android">liberated</a> 
	  the German Corona Warn app (CWA). The FSFE <a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20201208-01.html">appealed</a> to 
	  governments and administrations to publish developed software as 
	  Free Software, to break dependencies on Google&#39;s and 
	  Apple&#39;s app stores and instead make their apps installable 
	  from independent sources like F-Droid, and to renounce 
	  proprietary dependencies. This also helps to protect fundamental 
	  rights such as the right to privacy.
	</p>

	<figcaption>Example of Corona Tracing app</figcaption>
  </figure>
	 
	<p>
	  In August 2021, we witnessed the same 
	  problematic pattern in Germany: volunteers once more had to step 
	  in to take over the government&#39;s task in order to make the 
	  CovPass app available to everyone. The FSFE <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210830-01.html">urges</a> 
	  the government to quickly adapt its practices and make sure 
	  everyone can use such apps without any restrictions from the 
	  start. Furthermore, if ensured that solutions are published as 
	  Free Software, they can be adjusted and reused by other 
	  institutions around the world.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="eu-open-source-strategy">Examining the EU Open Source Strategy</h3>

  <p>
	  On October 21st 2020, the European Commission approved the new 
	  Open Source Software Strategy 2020-2023. On March 2021, we <a 
	  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB9Wga-AaHk&amp;list=PL1e89M45YLytKFFCu_SeeV4Ld2iPdDAoj&amp;index=2">interviewed</a> 
	  Evangelos Tsavalopoulos on this and asked the most important 
	  questions about this strategy.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="radio-lockdown">Preventing a Radio Lockdown</h3>
  
  <p>
	  Since 2015, we have been monitoring the possible unpleasant 
	  effects of the European Radio Equipment Directive which we coined 
	  <a href="/activities/radiodirective/">Radio Lockdown</a>. 
	  Although the FSFE has warned the European Commission multiple 
	  times of the disastrous consequences Article 3(3)(i) can have for 
	  users, organisations, and the whole communication equipment 
	  market, the regulators did not give in. However, in the recent 12 
	  months the Commission did not propose any concrete draft 
	  regulations, so we are in a limbo. The FSFE will continue to 
	  monitor the situation closely.
  </p>

  </figure>
  
  <h3 id="pmpc-workshops">Offering PMPC Workshops</h3>

  <p>
	  In the framework of its campaign &quot;Public Money? Public 
	  Code!&quot; the FSFE has launched a new workshop named <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/ContactingAdministrationsForPMPC">Contact 
	  your administrations</a>. Its target audience are volunteers and 
	  supporters from all over Europe who want to become active in 
	  reaching out their local representatives. This workshop aims to 
	  share best practices when addressing public administrations to 
	  discuss Free Software in the Public Sector, while empowering 
	  volunteers to become more active within their own communities. 
	  During 2021, Lina Ceballos, FSFE Project Manager, held two 
	  sessions online of this workshop for our Italian and Spanish 
	  communities.
  </p>

<h3 id="german-warning-system">Suggesting improvements to the German warning system</h3>

  <p>
    Already in November 2020, the FSFE flagged that <a 
	href="/news/2020/news-20201112-01.html">Germany's warning system is 
	unstable and ineffective</a> and pointed out pragmatic improvements 
	that can guarantee that a warning message can reach every person 
	needed while respecting software freedom and privacy. 
	Unfortunately, our suggestions have not been implemented in time: 
	the German warning system once again failed in July 2021 during a 
	number of heavy regional floodings, after which the FSFE <a 
	href="https://www.thelocal.de/20210730/germany-knew-its-disaster-warning-system-wasnt-good-enough-why-wasnt-it-improved-2/">reminded</a> 
	that the more effective alternatives must be adopted as soon as 
	possible to prepare for the next serious events. The commentary 
	received several republications. 
	Since this wake-up call, it seems the responsible administrations 
	have been giving this crucial change the necessary attention and 
	traction.
  </p>

<h3 id="code-repository-public-sector">Conceptualising a code repository for the public sector</h3>

  <p>
	  Together with our associated organisation the Open Source 
	  Business Alliance, the federal working group of municipal IT 
	  service providers and other experts, FSFE has developed a first 
	  concept for a code repository for the public sector. There, we 
	  clarified the potential of Free Software (<a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20200910-01.html">EN</a>, <a 
	  href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/papers/20200910-Ein-Ort-fuer-oeffentlichen-Code.v1.pdf">DE</a> 
	  for use in public institutions and how such a repository can 
	  contribute to the further development of the digitalisation of 
	  administrations. This concept is already being tested with a 
	  pilot project in the German states of <a 
	  href="/news/nl/nl-202103.html">North Rhine-Westphalia and 
	  Baden-Württemberg</a>.
  </p>

<h3 id="international-development-cooperation">Promoting Free Software in International Development Cooperation</h3>

  <p>
	  In December 2020, the FSFE published an <a 
	  href="/freesoftware/developmentcooperation/index.html">analysis</a> 
	  on the benefits of using Free Software in international 
	  development cooperation. In this increasingly digitised sector, 
	  Free Software is becoming an indispensable fundamental technology 
	  that guarantees legally compliant international cooperation and 
	  reuse. With Free Software, global scaling is possible, as well as 
	  local adaptability. New monopolies and dependencies are avoided, 
	  which is a major UN sustainability goal.
  </p>

<h3 id="sustainability">Connecting Free Software to Sustainability</h3>

  <p>
	  The FSFE demands three conditions that are necessary for a 
	  sustainable digital infrastructure. Our demands target 
	  specifically the market of phones and tablets, but they can be 
	  applied on a wider scale too. 
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
		When the software of a device is not supported any more, the 
		manufacturers should publish the source code of the software 
		and provide it as Free Software.
    </li>
    <li>
		We should be able to use alternative operating systems, and to 
		do so we need the practices that are artificially preventing it 
		to come to an end.
   </li>
   <li>
	   Smart devices should be produced with open standards, drivers, 
	   and interfaces, to ensure a sustainable use of hardware 
	   resources.
    </li>
  </ul>
	  
  <p>
	The <a 
	href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">Sustainability 
	of Free Software</a> has been published by Erik Albers, 
	Sustainability Program Manager of the FSFE. The article was written 
	in preparation of an upcoming campaign about Upcycling Android. 
	Erik Albers also gave a <a 
	href="https://media.ccc.de/v/wk04-7557-von-freier-software-zu-nachhaltiger-software-und-wieder-zurck">talk</a> 
	(DE) about the subject of software sustainability at this 
	year&#39;s winterkongress and in the second round table <a 
	href="https://www.greens-efa.eu/en/article/event/how-do-we-shape-and-grow-a-green-tech-sector">&quot;How 
	do we shape and grow a green tech sector?&quot;</a>, organised by 
	the Greens/EFA in the European Parliament. In February, said Author 
	co-published the <a 
	href="https://www.oekologisches-wirtschaften.de/index.php/oew/article/view/1788">research</a> 
	&quot;Design Options for Long-lasting, Efficient and Open Hardware 
	and Software&quot; in &quot;Ökologisches Wirtschaften: 
	Digitalisation and Sustainability&quot;. In January we <a

	in the European Comission&#39;s consultation about &quot;Designing 
	mobile phones and tablets to be sustainable – ecodesign&quot;. </p>

<h3 id="electoral-activities">Running Electoral activities</h3>

  <p>
	  Prior to the German elections we raised our <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210427-01.html">PMPC demand</a>, in line 
	  with our <a href="/activities/elections/index.html">electoral 
	  activities</a>. During the final week before the German federal 
	  election we reached out to politicians asking their stance on 
	  Free Software. The FSFE and the OSB Alliance conducted <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210920-01.html">interviews with 
	  representatives of five German political parties</a> (DE) . The 
	  videos are available in German. Also we released our <a 
	  href="https://digitalezivilgesellschaft.org/digitalvisionen/">vision 
	  for the upcoming decades and concrete demands for the next 
	  government</a> and analyzed the <a 
	  href="https://digitalezivilgesellschaft.org/wahlpruefsteine/oeffentliches-gut/">elections 
	  programs</a> of the parties.
  </p>

  
<h3 id="spreading-the-word">Spreading the word</h3>

  <p>
	  In 2021 we translated our &#39;Public Money? Public Code!&#39; 
	  video in <a href="https://publiccode.eu/sv/#about">Swedish</a>, 
	  <a href="https://publiccode.eu/nl/#about">Dutch</a>, and Spanish. 
	  Apart from those translations, the PMPC video is available in 
	  English, German, French, Italian, Portugese, Russian, and 
	  Slovenian.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="local-governments">Bringing Free Software to local governments</h3>

  <p>
	The transition to a Free Software framework is often starting at 
	the level of municipalities. On May 2021, we contributed to a 
	report on the use of Free Software in <a 
	href="https://www.kgst.de/documents/20181/34177/KGSt-Bericht-5-2021_Open-Source.pdf/994d10d0-ec25-f8ed-91af-1a12518c27d3">local 
	administrations</a> (DE) which was released by the German 
	association for municipal government.
  </p>
  <p>	
	With an overwhelming 
	cross-faction majority, <a href="/news/2021/news- 
	20210331-01.html">Dortmund</a> committed itself to the use of 
	Free Software in a groundbreaking <a 
	href="/news/2021/news-20210331-01.html">resolution</a> 
	(DE) in February 2021. The case of Dortmund, where the motion 
	passed unanimously, proves that all sides can appreciate the 
	practical benefits of Free Software. The result was made possible 
	by the consistent efforts of the DO-FOSS initiative, which also 
	supported the &quot;Public Money? Public Code&quot; campaign of the 
	FSFE. The Council&#39;s decision means that there is now the 
	political backing to gradually break down dependencies on 
	proprietary vendors. The FSFE will accompany the implementation and 
	at the same time call on other administrations in Germany and 
	Europe to follow Dortmund&#39;s example.
  </p>	
  
  <p>	
	The Swiss canton of <a 
	href="/news/2021/news-20210318-01.html">Bern</a> 
	embraced Free Software and the FSFE met online with the people 
	behind this process. Bern followed the steps of another Swiss 
	canton, Uri, trailbrazer for the use of Free Software in 
	administration. For years, the Free Software &#39;Caluma&#39; has 
	been successful in Switzerland. The example of the cantons of Uri 
	and Bern shows that the principle of &quot;Public Money? Public 
	Code!&quot; benefits everyone: citizens, the administration but 
	also the economy.
   </p>
   
<h2 id="router-freedom">2. Router Freedom at stake in the EU</h2>

  <p>
	  Since 2013 The FSFE has been a leading voice in promoting 
	  end-users&#39; right to use their own personal modems and 
	  routers. 2021 represented a benchmark on the implementation of 
	  this right in Europe. We put great efforts to protect router 
	  freedom on the European level. We have been involved in 
	  legislative processes and implementation of technical rules  in 
	  diverse jurisdictions in the EU. Also, we provide to communities 
	  and individuals all necessary elements to engage in initiatives 
	  so that they can push the agenda on a political level.

  <p>
	  This year demonstrated that although the regulatory framework 
	  remains fragmented in the EU, Router Freedom is emerging as a

	  use their own internet equipment all over Europe.

<h3 id="rf-informing">Informing and empowering the public</h3>

  <p>
	  In response to the EU reform of telecommunications law (EECC), we

  <p>
	  On March 2021, when EU countries started to implement the telecom 
	  reform, we launched an <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210330-01.html">Engagement Package</a> so 
	  that anyone can organize supporting activities for Router 
	  Freedom. The included <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters/">wiki 
	  page</a> helps the volunteers of the initiative identify 
	  interested people, collect information, and set up courses of 
	  action. To involve the maximum number of people, we promoted 
	  Router Freedom in several events, gave talks and organised expert 
	  meetings with stakeholders all over Europe. Our demands have been 
	  shared by several groups in public consultations and official 
	  hearings.

  <p>
	  We followed closely the positive developments in the <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210805-01.html">Netherlands</a>, 
	  which confirmed our demands pro consumer rights. In June 2021, we 
	  talked with a representative of the <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210629-01.html">Finnish 
	  regulator</a>, who explained why Router Freedom is essential for 
	  net neutrality. Our coordinated activities in <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210505-01.html">Greece</a> 
	  in May 2021 supported the regulator&#39;s preliminary decision to 
	  secure Router freedom. We worked closely with consumer 
	  organisations, digital groups, and business representatives to promote and leverage the 
	  agenda, demanding clear rules for consumers, as in the beginning 
	  of the legislative process in <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210506-01.html">Austria</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
	On another hand, we have monitored issues with implementations 
	which could harm Router Freedom. We raised our concerns when <a 
	href="/news/2021/news-20210505-01.html">Germany</a> 
	decided to step back from the positive experience the country has 
	built since 2016 by allowing the national regulator to determine a 
	regulatory framework against consumers. <a href="link to be 
	determined">Latvia</a> opened an extremely dangerous precedent by 
	allowing ISPs to determine by themselves technological issues to 
	prohibit the use of personal routers.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="collecting-data">Collecting Data</h3>
  
  <p>
	  Router Freedom is undergoing a rapid development in Europe, so we 
	  created a <a 
	  href="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/router-freedom-tracker_581123#4/53.12/18.37">monitoring 
	  map</a> to help everyone keep track on the Router Freedom status 
	  in their countries.

  <p>
	To understand better the issues end-users are facing with ISPs&#39; 
	abusive commercial practices, we started a <a 
	href="https://survey.fsfe.org/index.php/628449?lang=en">survey</a>. 
	With this unique initiative in the EU, we aim with this research to 
	gather data about end-user experience, so we can highlight the 
	issues to regulators and decision makers. Our survey is still open 
	and you are welcome to answer our questions.

<h3 id="reuse-booster">Launching REUSE Booster</h3>

  <p>
	 REUSE has facilitated the licensing of Free Software projects. 
	 Developers are given standardised ways to mark all files in a 
	 project with their chosen license and copyright notice. A 
	 tutorial, a set of FAQs, a helper tool, and an API have been made 
	 available to lower the threshold and save time.
  </p>

	<img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/0027eafb7bb2fdb1ec479675c1070ae2.png" alt="REUSE Booster logo" />
  </figure>
  
  <p>
	With <a href="https://reuse.software/booster/">REUSE Booster</a>, 
	the FSFE takes this initiative a step further. Free Software 
	projects can seek tailored support by legal experts. As the name 
	suggests, this will boost the process of adopting the best 
	practices as well as general understanding of licensing and 
	copyright. Each project is evaluated individually and the 
	recommendations apply to its particular situation.
  </p>

  <p>
	  Max Mehl joined a <a 
	  href="/news/podcast/episode-11.html">podcast</a> episode to 
	  present REUSE Booster and talk about the recent developments of 
	  the whole initiative. For example, REUSE was adopted by the KDE 
	  community as the standard best practice to communicate all 
	  projects' licensing and copyright situation. To learn how a large 
	  community like KDE managed this step, we interviewed <a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20201215-01.html">Andreas 
	  Cord-Landwehr</a>, long-term developer at KDE, to discuss this 
	  implementation.

	  court case against Lenovo</a>. Ιn a historic judgment in Italy, in 
	  a case initiated by FSFE supporter Luca Bonissi, Lenovo was 
	  ordered to pay 20,000 euros in damages for abusive behaviour in 
	  denying to refund the price of a pre-installed Windows licence. 
	  In a motivating gesture for the Free Software cause, Luca donated 
	  15,000 euros to the FSFE.

<h3 id="llw">Organising the Legal and Licensing Workshop 2021</h3>

  <p>
	  We organised and supported the very first online edition of the 
	  <a href="/activities/ln/llw.html">Legal and 
	  Licensing Workshop 2021</a>. The FSFE&#39;s Free Software Legal 
	  and Licensing Workshop (LLW) has been held annually for the <a 
	  href="/activities/ln/llw.html">FSFE&#39;s Legal Network</a> 
	  since 2008, and serves as a conference for <a 
	  href="/activities/ln/ln.html">legal experts</a> in the field 
	  of Free Software to debate over issues and share best practices 
	  surrounding Free Software licenses. Instead of a physical one-time 
	  conference, this year, from March to July, LLW offered online 
	  presentations, discussion panels, and workshops continuously.

	   Free Software licensing information, including those specific to 
	   copyleft licenses.As with all online discussions of the Legal 
	   Network and its associated events, the <a 
	   href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule">Chatham

	  “Our Free Software developer needs were understood and met with 
	  minimal frictions. With audits, this NGI0 support went further 
	  than just allowing us to spend more time working on the project, 
	  they taught us how to improve it. The FSFE REUSE team even 
	  contributed actual code with a regular merge-request, in a

    <h3 id="assistance-ngi0">Supporting Free Software Developers Through NGI0</h3>

  <p>
	  The FSFE  provided guidance on how to communicate the components, 
	  licenses, and copyrights associated with software packages. We 
	  assisted software projects with their legal and licensing needs, 
	  and convinced them to adopt our REUSE standards as best practices 
	  for displaying licensing and copyright information.
  </p>

  <p>
	 We have guided over 100 NGI0 software projects to implement the 
	 REUSE standards on their workflow. This has included working 
	 directly with their repositories to better improve how the 
	 licensing and copyright information contained in their 
	 repositories is displayed, so that any adopters of their work in 
	 the future can more easily comply with these license and 
	 copyright obligations.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
	<p>
	  "Regarding REUSE, we have learnt a lot. We realise that the 
	  idea behind REUSE is simple, clear, and powerful. Nowadays, 
	  Free Software projects become more and more complicated, and 
	  many components/files of a single project have different 
	  license/copyright information. REUSE helps a lot on tracking 
	  the status of this information in our project.”

	  "Being involved in NGI0 has been a nurturing experience. On one 
	  hand, it has been very interesting to work closely with and 
	  learn from projects that are reshaping the future of the 
	  internet. On the other, being part of the FSFE team has 
	  provided me with the necessary technical and legal skills to 
	  feel comfortable to contribute directly to projects'

  </p>
  
  <p>
	  We aimed to cover the most crucial current issues, such as the 
	  proprietary software monopolies which were formed within the rapid 
	  digitization after the outbreak of the pandemic. This issue was 
	  also related to the intentional misuse of the term Free Software 
	  for marketing purposes. Also, the panels coved three ongoing EU 
	  policies, the <a 
	  href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/ecoss/"> Open Source 
	  strategy</a>, the <a 
	  href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/digitalmarketsact/">Digital 
	  Markets Act</a>, and the regulations connected to <a

	  welcome new members from around Europe. In FSFE Women we meet 
	  every month online and cover aspects related to Free Software. In 
	  June 2021, Irmhild Rogalla gave a talk about the accessibility of 
	  video conferencing tools, supporting a conferencing platform for 
	  all. In July 2021, Bonnie Mehring presented PMPC in relation to

<h2 id="looking-forward">6. Looking forward to 2022</h2>

  <p>
	In 2022 we are going to monitor the implementation of our PMPC 
	demands, protect Router Freedom in countries where the respective 
	legislation is coming up, and advocate to prevent a Radio Lockdown. 
	We plan to have a physical Legal and License Workshop 2022, but we 
	will evaluate the current conditions when the time comes. We are 
	currently preparing the implementation of two exciting projects for 
	the next year.

  <p>
	 Youth Hacking 4 Freedom is a coding competition to inspire young 
	 people to Software Freedom. It will be open to teenagers 14-18 
	 from around Europe. Participants will compete in Youth Hacking for 
	 Freedom by creating programs of their choice licensed as Free 
	 Software. This hacking competition is a great opportunity for 
	 young people to receive inspiration and to network with important 
	 people of the field. For the winners, the cash prize might turn 
	 into an investment for their own project.

  <p>	
	Upcycling Android will be a campaign with a web presence and 
	practical workshops to overcome software obsolescence on Android by 
	installing Free Software. It will aim to achieve user’s freedom and 
	care for the environment at the same time. Overall, the next year 
	of the FSFE is exciting and promising as we plan to reach out to a 
	younger audience and to highlight the importance of software 
	sustainability. If you are interested to follow our future projects 
	make sure you <a href="link">subscribe</a> to our Newsletter.

<h2 id="join">Join our movement</h2>

  <p>
	  In the last few years, we exceeded ten thousand people from 
	  Europe and beyond who are supporting our cause by <a 
	  href="/contribute/spreadtheword">spreading our word</a>, signing 
	  our open letters, subscribing to our <a 
	  href="/contact/email-updates.html">community mails</a> and <a 
	  href="/news/newsletter.html">newsletter</a>, or joining our <a 
	  href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/discussion">public 
	  discussions</a>. If you ever wondered who all these people are 
	  and what a FSFE supporter looks like, we have created a dedicated 
	  <a href="/about/people/testimonials">testimonials page</a> for 
	  you, where many of our supporters have left a quote, an 
	  interview or a video.
  </p>

  <p>
	  <strong>The FSFE would be nothing without our contributors. And 
	  it would be so much more with you!</strong> If you feel inspired 
	  after reading our report, there are many ways to engage in our 
	  movement. We have a dedicated <a href="/contribute">contribution 
	  page</a> to help you find a way that best fits your interests and 
	  skills.

  <p>
	One of the easiest entrance levels is to spread the word about Free 
	Software in public or among your friends with our <a 
	href="/contribute/spreadtheword">promotion material</a> or directly 
	show your love for Free Software by wearing <a 
	href="/order/index.html">some of our inspiring merchandise 
	items</a>. Follow and share our <a href="/events/events.html">event 
	announcements</a>, find an event that fits your interests, and then 
	go there to meet like-minded people. Don&#39;t be shy; most of us 
	have been in your position once. Or see if you can even join <a 
	href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups">regular FSFE meetings in 
	different cities of Europe</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
	  If you find no event near you, you can also join us online. If 
	  you want to contribute with your <a 
	  href="/contribute/web/web.html">IT skills</a> or your <a 
	  href="/contribute/translators/translators.html">language 
	  skills</a>, you are more than welcome to join our respective 
	  online teams. Not yet sure where to start? Then look into <a 
	  href="https://community.fsfe.org/">our discourse-instance</a> and 
	  start to get to know our community and get inspired about what 
	  you can do.
  </p>

  <p>
	Finally, advocating for freedom also costs money and we depend on 
	people like you to <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/support">support us 
	financially</a>. All support is used to improve European software 
	freedom a little more each day, step by step, bit by bit.

  <h3 id="spreading-the-word">Spreading the word</h3>

  <p>
	  We offer gratis information packages, so that people can raise

	  November 2020 until now we have sent 263 information packages. 
	  Thank you to all of you who spread the news and help us to reach 
	  more people about Free Software. The FSFE T-shirt collection is 
	  beloved; we have sold 700 T-shirts since 1 November 2020. Also, 
	  we introduced two new products to celebrate 20 Years of the FSFE: 
	  a sticker and a bag, which you can see below.
