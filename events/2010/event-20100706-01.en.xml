    <title>Libre Software Meeting (aka RMLL), Bordeaux, France</title>
    <body>
      The 2010 Libre Software Meeting is a non commercial conference with talks, workshops and round tables about Free Software and its uses. The LSM provides a place for exchange and meeting between Free Software developers, users and stakeholders. This year, it will be at Bordeaux 1 University. <strong>Update:</strong> The FSFE will
present its activities at a booth. We are still looking for
helpers at that booth. Whoever is interested to join should contact &lt;rk at office dot fsfeurope dot org&gt;.
