<h1> Fuel the next wave of tech talent with YH4F, the FSFE’s Free Software
competition</h1>

<p>Youth Hacking 4 Freedom is the FSFE’s programming competition for
teenagers aged 14 to 18 years from across Europe. Through YH4F the FSFE
conveys the values and knowledge surrounding Free Software, provides the
chance to develop your own project idea, learn valuable skills for
project management, problem solving and of course: programming! Find out
why it is worth for you to support us in this mission and what our
current sponsors say about YH4F.</p>

<p>For four years the FSFE has organised YH4F and each year was and is a
reminder of what teenagers can achieve when they are given space,
guidance, and the freedom to build something meaningful. Every year,
participants surprise us with their creativity, dedication, and the
ambition to make a difference through Free Software.</p>

<p>YH4F is only possible through the generous support of our sponsors
and our visionary donor Reinhard Wiesemann, who help turn these ideas
into real opportunities. As we prepare for YH4F 2026, we are once again
looking for partners who share our vision: a Europe where young people
can explore technology, learn by doing, and shape the digital future
with Free Software. <a

all about the possibilities to support YH4F
</a>.</p>

<p>And the impact is clear. Our Gold and Platinum sponsors for YH4F
2025, OpenSSF and Proxmox Server Solutions, have seen first hand how
their contribution helps young participants grow, collaborate, and
innovate. Their stories show just how rewarding it is to be part of this
journey.</p>

<p>But before we dive into their experiences, let’s take a moment to
introduce this two organisations that supported YH4F 2025. </p>

<p>Proxmox is a provider of, enterprise-grade, Free Software server
software, focusing on developing and maintaining three core platforms:
Proxmox Virtual Environment, an all-in-one Free Software server 
virtualisation solution; Proxmox Backup Server and Proxmox Mail Gateway.
</p>

<p>The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) is a cross-industry
initiative under the Linux Foundation to secure Free Software for the
greater public good by fostering collaboration, establishing best
practices, and developing innovative solutions that secure the
development, maintenance, and consumption of Free Software. </p>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Hello Dominik. We are really grateful for Proxmox support for
YH4F. What motivated Proxmox to sponsor YH4F? What aspects of this
competition made it stand out to you as something worth sponsoring?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Dominik (Proxmox): </strong>Proxmox is motivated by a deep commitment to the Free
Software movement and its future. Sponsoring YH4F is a direct investment
in the next generation of technologists and innovators. We see this
event as a great platform for fostering programming skills and, more
importantly, instilling the core values of software freedom
-transparency, collaboration, and user control- at an early age.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Thank you! This is truly empowering and we are very moved by
your statement about YH4F. From OpenSSF we have Stacey, CRob, and
Madalin with us today. Would any of you like to share what you
personally value most about YH4F?</p>
</div>


<div class="answer">
<p><strong>OpenSFF:</strong> Youth Hacking 4 Freedom perfectly aligns with our core
mission of building a more secure open source future. What immediately
stood out to us is how YH4F empowers young Europeans to create
meaningful Free Software projects while learning security-conscious
development practices from the ground up.<br/>

We are particularly inspired by the creativity and technical
excellence we have seen from participants across all four years of the
competition. These young developers are tackling real-world problems
with innovative solutions, and their commitment to Free Software values
gives us tremendous hope for the future of secure software
development.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What skills do you think young Europeans gain from
participating in YH4F? Do you think that there are unique skills or
values students gain when contributing to Free Software projects?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Dominik</strong>: Participants in YH4F and similar Free Software projects are
able to gain a unique and highly valuable skill set that goes beyond
just coding. More profoundly, they internalise the values of software
freedom. This includes the understanding that everyone has the right to
access, study, modify, and share software. These are not just technical
advantages; they are core principles that empower developers to build a
more trustworthy and resilient digital world.</p>
</div>


<div class="answer">
<p><strong>OpenSFF</strong>: Even more, YH4F participants develop a comprehensive skill
set that is invaluable for Free Software contribution. They gain
hands-on experience in software development, project management, and
most importantly, collaborative coding practices that are fundamental to
open source communities.<br/>

The competition teaches participants to think about software as a
shared resource, considering documentation, code clarity, and
maintainability not just for themselves, but for future contributors.
They learn to present their work to expert juries, developing crucial
communication skills needed when proposing patches, participating in
code reviews, or engaging with maintainer communities.<br/>

Perhaps most valuable, they experience the entire lifecycle of a Free
Software project: from initial ideation and development to public
presentation and community feedback. This mirrors exactly how
contributions to major Free Software projects work, making these young
developers natural fits for our ecosystem.</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Stacey, CRob and Madalin, how do think programs like YH4F can
prepare young people for future careers in technology?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>OpenSFF</strong>: YH4F provides an exceptional foundation for technology
careers by combining technical skill development with real-world project
experience. Participants learn to work independently, manage timelines,
and deliver complete solutions—skills that are essential regardless of
their future tech path.<br/>

The competition's international scope exposes participants to diverse
perspectives and approaches, preparing them for the global nature of
modern technology work. Monthly calls with participants across Europe
build networking skills and cultural awareness that will serve them
throughout their careers.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Dominik. from your perspective, what role does Free Software
play in the future workforce?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Dominik</strong>: As governments and enterprises seek to reduce their
dependence on single vendors, Free Software provides a path to
independence, sustainability, and transparency. A workforce fluent in
Free Software principles is essential for building a resilient digital
future. These individuals are not just users of technology but active
participants in its evolution, capable of understanding, customizing,
securing, and maintaining the infrastructure we all depend on. </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What kinds of opportunities do you see opening up for these
young programmers in the next years?</p>
</div>


<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Dominik</strong>: As the concept of digital sovereignty gains momentum on a
global scale, we see a growing demand for professionals who understand
how to build secure, independent, and resilient systems. This opens
doors across a wide range of fields, from government and public sector
IT to enterprise infrastructure and beyond. </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>OpenSFF</strong>: To add on what Dominik said, the opportunities are
incredibly exciting! YH4F participants are positioning themselves at the
intersection of some of the most important trends in technology: open
source development, security-conscious programming, and collaborative
innovation.<br/>

They will find doors open in cybersecurity, where their understanding
of transparent, auditable code gives them an edge. In emerging fields
like AI/ML security – one of OpenSSF's key focus areas – their
foundation in Free Software principles will be invaluable as we work to
develop trustworthy AI systems.<br/>

Beyond traditional tech roles, we also see opportunities in policy
and governance, where their technical expertise combined with Free
Software values will be crucial for shaping technology regulation and
standards. Many YH4F participants could become the security engineers,
project maintainers, and technology leaders of tomorrow.</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Dominik, what advice would you give to young people considering
a career in tech, specifically in Free Software?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Dominik</strong>: My advice is simple but powerful: embrace the community.
Find a project that interests you and dive deep into the documentation
and the source code, but do not stop there. Participate in forums, ask
questions, and offer your help where you can. By actively engaging, you
not only build your technical skills but also develop a network and a
reputation for collaboration and expertise.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Do you believe it’s important to expose young generations to
Free Software early in their learning journey?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>OpenSFF</strong>: Early exposure to Free Software fundamentally shapes how
developers think about code, collaboration, and responsibility. When
young developers start with proprietary, closed-source tools, they often
develop a mindset of code as private property. Free Software teaches
them that code is a shared resource that benefits from transparency and
collaboration.<br/>

From a security perspective, early exposure to Free Software helps
developers understand the importance of auditable, transparent code.
They learn to write code that others will read, review, and potentially
improve, naturally leading to better security practices.<br/>

Perhaps most importantly, Free Software instils values of sharing
knowledge and contributing to the common good. These are not just nice
ideals, they are practical approaches that lead to more robust, secure,
and innovative software.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Did Free Software play a role in your own career or even
personal path? What’s your favourite Free Software project (either
professional or personal) and why?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Dominik</strong>: From both a professional and personal standpoint, Free
Software has been foundational to my career. While Proxmox VE is, of
course, the professional project I am most passionate about, my personal
favourite is the Linux kernel since its development exemplifies the very
essence of Free Software: it is transparent, robust, and has created a
foundation upon which so much of the modern world's digital
infrastructure is built. </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: If a teenager wants to start contributing to Free Software
today, what first step would you recommend?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Dominik</strong>: The first and most important step is to find a project that
genuinely interests you. Free Software exists for almost any
passion—from gaming to graphic design to enterprise virtualisation. Do
not be intimidated; instead, embrace the freedom and accessibility that
Free Software provides.</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>
OpenSFF</strong>: Start by identifying software you actually use and care
about. Whether it's a game, a development tool, or a mobile app—if it's
Free Software, there's likely a way to contribute. Begin with non-code
contributions: improve documentation, report bugs clearly, help with
translations, or assist other users in forums.<br/>

Once you're comfortable with the project's community and processes,
look for "good first issue" tags in the project's repository. These are
specifically marked as suitable for newcomers. Do not worry about making
perfect contributions initially—focus on learning the development
workflow and community norms.<br/>

Programs like Youth Hacking 4 Freedom are also excellent starting
points because they provide structured support and mentorship while you
develop your own project. The skills you learn building your own Free
Software project directly transfer to contributing to existing
projects.<br/>

Most importantly, be patient and persistent. Building expertise in
Free Software is a journey, not a destination, but it's one of the most
rewarding paths in technology today.</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: One final question, Stacey, CRob and Madalin. What is your
favourite Free Software program?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Stacey</strong>: It's difficult to choose just one, as so many Free Software
programs have been transformative. However, I'm particularly inspired by
projects that demonstrate the security and reliability advantages of
open source development - like the Linux kernel, which powers much of
our critical infrastructure, or security-focused projects where
transparency enables community auditing.<br/>

What I love most about these projects is how they prove that
collaborative development does not just match proprietary alternatives -
it often surpasses them in security, reliability, and innovation.</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>CRob</strong>: Not Fair! I would have an easier time picking my favourite
kid!! The question is a bit of a false premise, I cannot possibly pick
just ONE FOSS project, there are so, so many amazing projects out
there. The OpenSSF alone is home to over 20 impactful, wonderful
projects, and we are just one group among over 1,000 that live at the
Linux Foundation. <br/>

My favourite project TODAY is Gimp (since I am doing some graphics
work using it). What I enjoy about Gimp is that I have a
professional-grade tool at my disposal that the community is constantly
updating with new features and fixes. Tomorrow, I expect something
else, maybe Protobom will be my favourite project since I have to have
several calls around Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Madalin</strong>: My favourite Free Software is Git - not because it's flashy
or trendy, but because it quietly powers almost everything in the open
source world. <br/>
Git is a version control system. Think of it as a time machine for
code. It helps developers track every change they make to a project, so
they can collaborate with others, experiment without fear, and easily
revert to previous versions if something goes wrong. It’s the backbone
of open source development, and it has completely changed how we build
and maintain software. It’s the invisible foundation that makes
large-scale collaboration possible. It teaches us the importance of
traceability and accountability in a collaborative environment. <br/>

From a policy and cybersecurity perspective, I find Git especially
interesting because it's decentralised by design. There’s no single
point of failure, no central authority controlling access. That
architecture reflects the values of openness, transparency, and
resilience—all of which are crucial in cybersecurity. Git helps ensure
that critical code can survive censorship, outages, or even attacks.<br/>

Without Git, there would be no GitHub, no massive projects like the
Linux kernel, and no simple way for a new developer to contribute to a
project from halfway across the world. Most importantly, Git empowers
people. Anyone, anywhere in the world, can fork a program, improve it,
and share it back. That sense of agency is what excites me most about
open source - and what I hope more young people will discover for
themselves. It shows that the most powerful tools are often the ones
that empower others to build something new.</p>
</div>
