    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/greve/?p=354">Changes in FSFE: Time to pass on the torch</a> (2009-06-24)<br />Introducing the new executive team of FSFE and giving background for the handover.</li>
      <li><a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/greve/?p=309">Considerations on Innovation and Competition Policy</a> (2009-03-31)<br /> Contribution to the workshop "<a href="http://www.voxinternet.org/spip.php?article279&amp;lang=en">Technical Regulation of the Internet : From Standardization to Behavioral and Societal Norms</a>" in Paris, France. The article provides an overview over different areas of innovation policy, their interaction, and how to strike a balance between the conflicting methodologies of different innovative instruments. Audio recording of the corresponding talk made available by the organisers as <a href="http://download.fsfeurope.org/audio/20090331-Greve-Paris.ogg">OGG Vorbis</a> and <a href="http://download.fsfeurope.org/audio/20090331-Greve-Paris.mp3">MP3</a>. </li>
      <li><a href="/activities/os/ps.html">Analysis on balance: Standardisation and Patents</a> (2008-12-02)<br /> Following up on the "<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/itemshortdetail.cfm?item_id=3371">IPR in ICT Standardisation</a>" Workshop two weeks ago in Brussels, FSFE president Georg Greve analysed the conflicts between patents and standards. The resulting is paper about the most harmful effects of patents on standards, the effectiveness of current remedies, and potential future remedies.</li>
      <li><a href="/activities/wipo/statement-20070928.html">FSFE's written statement to the 2007 General Assembly</a> (2007-09-28)<br />Statement at the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/details.jsp?meeting_id=12803">2007 Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO</a>, 24 September - 3 October 2007</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070923170905803">Microsoft, antitrust and innovation (on Groklaw)</a> (2007-09-27)<br />"If one were to believe Microsoft, antitrust law is for sore losers who are too lazy to innovate, and the decision of the European Court of Justice against Microsoft was to the detriment of consumers around the world. One might even believe that any company with large enough market share would now have to fear the wrath of the European Commission and its anti-innovation bloodhounds."</li>
      <li><a href="/documents/msooxml-converter-hoax.html">The converter hoax</a> (2007-07-16)<br />FSFE Guest Commentary on Heise.de: "Conversion between Microsoft's Office OpenXML (MS-OOXML) and the vendor-independent Open Document Format (ODF) has been proposed by Microsoft and its associates as a solution to the problems caused by Microsoft's efforts to push a format into the market that conflicts with the existing Open Standard. [...] If these converters were actually able to do what they promise to do, they would be unnecessary." </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20061208135621706">Novell's "Danaergeschenk" (on Groklaw)</a> (2006-12-08)<br />"With OpenXML, it appears as if there will be interoperability on paper only, but in reality people will experience numerous difficulties unless they use Microsoft Office. Because most users rightly fear and loathe incompatibilities, out of a sense of false security and lack of technological background, they will often choose the dominant product, effectively punishing the competitor for the behaviour of the dominant player."</li>
      <li><a href="/activities/policy/igf/sovsoft.html">Sovereign Software - Open Standards, Free Software, and the Internet</a> (2006-10-30)<br />Software issues are issues of power and fundamentally shape the societies we are living in. Even to those who had not followed digital policy issues before this became increasingly evident throughout the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). Two fundamental questions characterise this battlefield: Who controls your data? Who controls your computer?</li>
