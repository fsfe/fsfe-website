<h1>
  Software Freedom Podcast #1 on Day Against DRM with Cory Doctorow
</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">
  We have a Podcast! Starting with this episode, we will talk once a
  month with people who have inspiring ideas about software freedom. In
  our first episode of our Software Freedom Podcast, we address the
  issue of Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) together with Cory
  Doctorow, a British-Canadian writer, political activist, and
  co-editor of the blog boingboing.net. Cory Doctorow is a prominent
  supporter of software freedom and a less restrictive copyright law.
  His books are published under Creative Commons licenses.

  When we planned the first episode, we exchanged some ideas for
  possible guests. When we heard that the <a
  href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/dayagainstdrm/2019">Day
  Against DRM</a> will take place in October we thought: we have to get
  Cory Doctorow as our first guest on Digital Restrictions Management.
  In this episode of the Software Freedom Podcast, we talk about the
  difference between books and an e-books with DRM, how authors and
  artist can make money without DRM, security implications of DRM,
  regulation of the so called "Internet of Things", and other questions
  related to this issue.
