  <h1>Call for Participation: FSFE community meeting and FSFE track at the Libre Software Meeting</h1>
  
  <p>The Libre Software Meeting (LSM) is maybe the biggest community-driven Free Software meeting in France and in 2018 also serves as host of the FSFE community meeting. It takes place in Strasbourg and the FSFE will organise its own track on the first days of LSM, from 7 to 9 of July. This is your chance to be part in the FSFE's community meeting and to give a talk at the LSM 2018 at the same time. Deadline to apply for a talk is April 30 - and before you forget it, <a href="https://rmll2018.info/conferences/RMLL2018/program/proposals/new">apply now!</a></p>

	<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is happy to align with Hackstub, the Strasbourg hackerspace that is organising the <a href="https://2018.rmll.info/">Libre Software Meeting 2018</a> (also known as Rencontres Mondiales du Logiciel Libre / RMLL). That means that the FSFE's community meeting 2018 will be part of the LSM and vice versa. As the LSM is a big community-driven event by itself, this cooperation offers an exciting environment for the FSFE community to meet up itself as well as to connect with the broader and international Free Software community. More details of the meeting will come in the next weeks but you can already be assured that the content of the meeting will be made by and for the community. There will be a dedicated FSFE room during the weekend days of 7 and 8 of July and a full-day agenda on Monday, July 9. The registration form for the community meeting is still to come, stay tuned.</p>

	<p>Besides the community meeting, the FSFE is also organising its own track. This is your chance to be part in the FSFE's community meeting and to give a talk at the LSM 2018 at the same time. Deadline to apply for a talk is April 30 - and before you forget it, better <a href="https://rmll2018.info/conferences/RMLL2018/program/proposals/new">apply now!</a> <br /><em>(choose "Free Software Foundation Europe" when asked about "Track")</em></p>

	<p>One topic of our track will be "Digital Education" - a topic that ranges from school education via code literacy to understanding of ethical concepts behind information technology. But you are free to propose other topics. Generally, we are looking forward for inspiring talks and workshops covering golden cages and user's liberation - in educational environments as well as in our everyday lives. You can also find more details in our <a href="/news/2018/news-20180322-01">previous announcement</a></p>
