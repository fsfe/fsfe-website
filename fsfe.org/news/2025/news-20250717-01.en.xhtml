<h1>CRA: Free Software stewards, maintainers and manufactures, share 
your input!</h1> 
<p>To assess how the EU Cyber Resilience Act may impact 
the Free Software ecosystem, the “Dialogue on Cybersecurity” project, 
of which the FSFE is part, have developed a questionnaire. Its aim is 
to develop proposals for guidance. </p>

<p>While the implementation of the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is 
currently underway, several questions remain open. Especially regarding 
its implications for the Free Software landscape. The relationship 
between Free Software projects, potential stewards and manufacturers, 
hangs only partially defined, and guidance will help. </p> 

<p>To gain deeper insight into how the Free Software ecosystem will be 
affected, the  <a href="https://www.dialog-cybersicherheit.de/">"Dialog für Cybersicherheit" (Dialogue on Cybersecurity)</a> 
project, of which the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is part, 
is distributing a questionnaire to relevant stakeholders, including 
Free Software stewards, maintainers, and manufacturers. This 
questionnaire assumes you are familiar with the CRA and your feedback 
will be published anonymously.</p>

<p>The questionnaire is designed to collect crucial information that 
will help shape an informed response to the CRA's implementation and 
contribute in particular to guidance.</p> 

<div class="quote">
<p>Contribute by answering our questionnaire:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dialog-cybersicherheit.limesurvey.net/146965?lang=en ">Potential Free Software stewards (EN)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dialog-cybersicherheit.limesurvey.net/241948?lang=en">Free Software projects (EN)</a></li>
<li><a heref="https://dialog-cybersicherheit.limesurvey.net/582853?lang=en">Manufacturer (EN)</a></li> 
</ul>
</div>


<p>The aim of this questionnaire is also to show ways in which the 
results can be incorporated into the implementation process of the CRA, 
helping to understand challenges, relationships between manufacturers 
and Free Software projects and will help to draft needed guidance. This 
will streamline our work with the Free Software ecosystem and the 
European Commission to make sure the CRA implementation does not harm 
our community.</p>

<h3>Preliminary evaluation: presentation at FrOSCon 2025</h3>

<p>The questionnaire will be open for anonymous responses until August 
31 but all responses received by July 30 will be included in an initial 
evaluation. These preliminary results will be presented as part of <a href="https://programm.froscon.org/froscon2025/talk/0a656836-cb27-4ef1-80e1-d64c553a96ca/">a 
presentation at FrOSCon 2025</a>, which will be on 16 and 17 August in 
Sankt Augustin (Germany). All feedback, including feedback after July 
30 will be considered in the final analysis. We appreciate your 
participation and support – <strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
