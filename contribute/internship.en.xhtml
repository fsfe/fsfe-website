        Working at the Free Software Foundation Europe lets you get close to
an amazing variety of topics and tasks. This diversity brings a lot of
technical, organisational, social and political experience and skills,
which are great to have for any Free Software enthusiast.

        I am very happy that I could join FSFE for almost a year. When I finished law school I tended to see legal issues very narrowly. My stay with FSFE changed this and helped me to form a bigger and more complex picture.

        FSFE is a stimulating environment to work in. There are few
        organisations where you can learn from so many perspectives in this
        international and interdisciplinary context. If you read my <a

        of some things I've been working on.  <cite><a

<h2>Basic internship facts: </h2>
<ul>
        <li>Duration: 4-12 months, full-time. </li>
        <li>Starting date: anytime. </li>
        <li>Location: Berlin, Germany. </li>
        <li>Remuneration: EURO 450/month. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who we're looking for:</h2>
<p> 
FSFE interns are a pretty diverse bunch. If you are interested in
working on the frontline of technology policy and activism, then
you've come to the right place. You're fired up about a free
information society, and you've already done something to tell others
why freedom matters? Then this internship is for you. Your academic
background and qualifications matter less than your experience, your
will to learn, and your ability to get things done. We expect:
</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
          Solid basic knowledge of, and considerable interest in, Free
          Software (required)
        </li>
        <li>
          Fluent English (written and spoken) is a requirement; 
          a working knowledge of German and/or other languages is an asset.
        </li>
        <li>
          Basic acquaintance with working on GNU/Linux systems (desirable)
        </li>
        <li>
         Ability to be creative, responsible, and to multitask. 
        </li>
        <li>
         Ability to integrate into a young, motivated and professional team
        </li>
        <li>
          No programming skills required. Programming is one of the
          few things you probably <i>won't</i> be doing during your
          internship.
        </li>
	<li>We want more women to be involved in Free Software. That's
	why we will give preference to applications from suitably
	qualified female candidates.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>
       Having no hacking experience but a strong political background,
working for the FSFE was an amazing experience for me and the same
will be true for everybody interested in software and users freedom.
International collaboration, writing policy papers, contact
stakeholders and taking care of community activities are just examples
of interesting tasks to learn from and that are quite fun in FSFE`s
friendly team.
