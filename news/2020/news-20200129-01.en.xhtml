<h1>FSFE is hiring: interns and trainees for legal, policy and technical areas</h1>

<p>We are looking for interns and trainees experienced in legal, policy or technical fields. The persons will work 35 hours per week with our team in the FSFE's Berlin office. There will be coordination with remote staff and volunteers, and depending on the work area opportunity to participate in events and meetings throughout Europe.</p>


<h2>About the FSFE</h2>

<p>Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to control technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives; and it is important that this technology empowers rather than restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.</p>

<p>The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination. It enhances users' rights by abolishing barriers to Free Software adoption, encourages people to use and develop Free Software, and provides resources to enable everyone to further promote Free Software in Europe.</p>

<p>We drive numerous activities and campaigns to reach our targets, for example "<a href="https://publiccode.eu">Public Money Public Code</a>", "<a href="https://savecodeshare.eu">Save Code Share</a>" and the <a href="https://reuse.software">REUSE initiative</a>.</p>


<h2>What we can offer</h2>

<p>We work together with decision makers, licensing experts in the world's largest <a href="/activities/ln/ln.html">Legal Network</a> on these topics, facilitated by the FSFE, and <a href="/associates/associates.html">Free Software organisations</a> all over Europe and beyond. This work is either done directly by staff or together with volunteers, as well as other Free Software and digital rights associations around Europe.</p>

<p><strong>You will enjoy:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A challenging and exciting time with a dynamic NGO working internationally.</li>
  <li>A close-up view of organisational and community processes.</li>
  <li>A chance to take the initiative and put your own ideas into practice.</li>
  <li>The opportunity to meet and work with Free Software advocates across Europe.</li>
</ul>
