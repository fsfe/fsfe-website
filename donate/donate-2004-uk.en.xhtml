     <h2>Donations to the FSFE in the United Kingdom</h2>

     <p>Due to substantial bank fees charged for international money
     transfers, small donations or standing orders are too expensive
     to be send directly to the <a
     href="donate-2002.en.html#fsfe-account">FSFE bank account</a>.
     To rectify this, we entered into an agreement with our UK based
     associate organisation <a href="http://www.affs.org.uk">AFFS</a>,
     to collect donations for us and transfer them in larger
     batches.</p>

     <p>Donations  from the United Kingdom may be done using one of
     these ways:</p>

     <ul>

     <li/><p>Direct bank payment<br/>Sort code: 08-92-99<br/>Bank account: 65088892<br/>

     publicly, the FSFE also provides some <a
