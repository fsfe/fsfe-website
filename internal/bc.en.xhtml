<h1>Request Business Cards</h1>

<blockquote class="r">
   "Business cards must answer the following quetions:
   <br />Who is this? 
   <br />Who is represented?
   <br />What is he/she doing there? 
   <br />How can I reach him/her?"
   <br />(Matthias Kirschner)
</blockquote>

<p>
The purpose of this form is to avoid unnecessary,
duplicate work. In the past, the process "production
of business cards" triggered a minimum of 10 emails
(but often enough far more) per person per set of
cards. We want to reduce this. We do not assume that
people are stupid. We do assume that some people
simply do not know certain things. We do not assume,
but we are sure, that Murphy is out there to get us.
</p>

<h2>Generally</h2>

<p>
Please write an
<a href="/internal/er.html">expense request</a> first.
</p>

<p>
The question whether you get cards or not, should be
coordinated with the others (whoever that might be).
FIXME: Pointer to a policy, whenever it might exist.
</p>

<p>
The details of your card (especially the
title/function) should be coordinated with the appropiate
Co-ordinator(s) to fit the FSFE's policy(s).
</p>

<p>
Please write an
<a href="/internal/er.html">expense request</a> first.
</p>

<h3>Language</h3>

<p>
English is default. If you need cards in another language
for good reasons, we have to produce two sets of cards.
Please use the form below twice in this case.
</p>

<h2>Content of the card</h2>

<p>
Please wait for the approval of your
<a href="/internal/er.html">expense request</a> before
using that form.

<h3>1. First name and surname</h3>

We do use the international form with all parts in lower
cases with a leading upper case for each word.
If there are very good reasons to use another form,
i.e. printing the surname in upper cases, as it is
common in France, this should be done at the localised
version of the cards, not in the int. version.
<br />Data might include middle initials, but no nicknames as
to be used in IRC.

</td>

<h3>2. Your title (or function)</h3>

A title/function should be mentioned. It might be generic,
somehow, i.e. "German Team".
<br />In case of interns that might be a simple "intern",
but you can leave it empty as well, for everything else
than producing 500 cards has no use, and interns most
likely tend to stay active in FSFE after their internship.

mentioned.

<h3>3. The line "Free Software Foundation Europe"</h3>

Don't care. This will be included automatically.
</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<h3>4. Address</h3>

This should be the official FSFE address, wherever that
might be. If you are working at an FSFE office, use this
address, not your home address.

<br />If there are very good reasons to use another address,
please ask the others (whoever that might be).
Do not forget to mention the country, please.

    <input type="radio" name="address" value="other" /> <input type="text" name="other_address" value="" />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<h3>5. Tel. (optional)</h3>

When working at an FSFE office, the number of that office
should be mentioned. If not, it might be your own number
or left empty. If in doubt, ask the others.  The number
should be grouped by two or three digits, seperated by
spaces.

<h3>6. Mobile (optional)</h3>

Your personal mobile no., e.g.

<br />You should be reachable by phone. So as a minimum
5. <em>or</em> 6. should be fullfilled.

<h3>7. Fax (optional)</h3>

It seems to be consensus in FSFE that this is an endangered
communication protocoll. If you really are in need to use
it, mention it by using the format of phone.
(I can't remember having ever seen a fax number on a FSFE
business cards...)

<h3>8. Email</h3>

This should be your fsfe.org address (or fsfeurope.org,
if everything else fails).

</td>

E-mail <input type="text" size="25" name="email" value="@fsfe.org" />
<pre><del>another123@freemailservice.com</del></pre>

<h3>9. Jabber (optional)</h3>

Your FSFE jabber address. (You don't know that you have
a jabber address? Something went wrong...)

<tr>

<h3>10. Fingerprint</h3>

The fingerprint of your GnuPG key. No, not the key ID, not
the kind of your key. The fingerprint will be printed in two lines.
<br />(You do not have a GnuPG key? Something went
terribly wrong.)

<h3>11. URL</h3>

There is no need to mention an URL. "www.fsfe.org"
will be printed on the back side automatically.

</td>

<tr>

<h3>12. Amount of cards</h3>

500 is the default value. 500 cards will cost some 32 EUR.
Your <a href="/internal/er.html">expense request</a> is approved?
Everything less than 500 cards will cost almost the
same. If there are good reasons to produce another amount,
tell here.

<tr>
<td>
<h3>13. No of approved expense request</h3>
You should have ensured that the cards are paid by FSFE.
Please enter the number of the approved <a href="/internal/er.html">expense request</a> here.

<h2>What happens now?</h2>

<h3>14. Preview</h3>

The printing company won't start the production before a
preview (PDF) is approved by you. We will send it to you and will
await your approval. We will use your fsfe.org address for
that purpose. (If that won't work, you have a serious
problem.)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<h3>15. Delivery address</h3>

After your approval, we will send the cards to the address
which is printed on the cards, by default.
<br />If you want us to send them elsewhere, tell us the
other address, please.
</td>
<td>
<textarea cols="40" rows="5" name="delivery_address" ></textarea>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">
If <em>all</em> needed data is <em>available and correct</em>,
and you are fast by approving, you will receive your cards within
5 to 10 days, depending on the snail mail systems. Our all-time
record is 24 hours. If problems are occuring, the delay will be hellish.
Our all-time record is 6 months.
<br />In most cases, office DUS can't answer your questions
regarding the data. In seldom cases, we can. If in doubt, ask
the others first.
