      Freedom is an essential right of human beings, both in physical world and
      digital world. However there are still many, many people being bounded in
      the digital world without being aware of it. We truly believe in the
      value and the human rights of software freedom, which should be without
      borders. That is exactly why, though not in Europe, we still strongly
      support the ideas, notions, and campaigns of FSFE.
