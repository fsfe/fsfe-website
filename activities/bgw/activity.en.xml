    <title>Brave GNU World</title>
    <description>
      The Brave GNU World was a monthly column issued from 1999 to 2004 that
      addressed technical and non-technical readers alike. Its aim was to
      provide insights into current projects and developments based upon the
      philosophy of Free Software. The Brave GNU World was translated into nine
      languages, possibly making it the farthest-spread monthly column
      worldwide.
