<p>Microsoft v. Barnes &amp; Noble: Trivial patents lawsuit?</p>

<blockquote><p>
Barnes &amp; Noble has  done the world a tremendous favor, by pulling aside the curtain and  revealing Microsoft’s patent campaign tactics against Android in lurid  detail.</p>
<p>It reveals the assertion of “trivial” and “invalid” patents against  Barnes &amp; Noble and some shocking details […].</p></blockquote>

<p>Patents in the multimedia realm have always been an issue; recently with the battle for HTML5 video codecs between H264, backed by Apple and Microsoft, against Theora and WebM backed by Google, Opera, Mozilla and others. A lot of media and PR from proprietary companies tried to discredit Free Software technologies by means of patent infringement threats. This article about the Xiph.org foundation shows what legal strategy can be pursued; and how much this draws back innovation.</p>

<blockquote><p>
One way to combat that  is to document why the patents don’t apply. Basically, Xiph did enough  research to show why the Qualcomm patents don’t apply to Opus and it is  planning to release that information. It is a dangerous strategy at some  level because it gives away some of the defense strategy, he said, but  Xiph has to try something.</p></blockquote>
