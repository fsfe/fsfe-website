<h1>We demand Router Freedom for Italian Internet users!</h1>

<p>The Italian regulator AGCOM will decide whether to limit or consolidate 
Router Freedom in the country. The FSFE has
actively engaged in a coalition of organisations urging the authority to
prioritize consumer protection and the rights of end-users to use their
own routers/modems in fiber networks.</p>

<p>In February 2025, Italy's telecommunications regulator, AGCOM,
initiated a regulatory process to determine whether consumers will have
the right to choose and use their own routers/modems in fiber networks
(FTTx). The decision involves delimiting the boundary between the public
network and the end-user’s private network, technically known as
“Network Termination Point” (NTP). While Italy was one of the first
countries to formally introduce Router Freedom in 2018, since then, <a
href="/news/2024/news-20241016-01.html">AGCOM has
introduced a series of exceptions </a>undermining end-users' rights,
negatively impacting how consumers use their own equipment to connect to
fiber networks. </p>


<h3>No technological necessity to limit freedom of terminal equipment in
fiber networks</h3>

<p>AGCOM has opened a public consultation asking about the pros and cons of
determining the position of the NTP in ways which could either
consolidate Router Freedom or undermine this right from the perspective
of end-users. The FSFE has submitted its response (<a

href="http:// https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-agcom-it-25.pdf">IT</a>),
advocating for the NTP to be designated at the passive physical point
where the public network connects to the end-user's premises. This means
freedom of routers and modems for fiber networks.</p>

<p>We highlighted to AGCOM that, in recent years, regulators from <a
href="/news/2021/news-20210629-01.html">Finland</a>, <a
href="/news/2021/news-20210805-01.html">the
Netherlands</a>, <a
href="/news/2023/news-20231113-02.html">Belgium</a> and
<a href="/news/2025/news-20250124-01.html">Germany</a>
have analysed the topic in great detail and have found no objective
technological necessity (a requirement in EU law to limit Router
Freedom) for fiber networks.
Besides, we provided the regulator with comprehensive evidence from our <a href="/news/2023/news-20230515-02.html">Router Freedom
survey</a> that consumers in Italy definitely support Router Freedom
as a crucial element of Net Neutrality.
Therefore, we called on AGCOM to maintain a unified
approach to terminal equipment regulations and protect Italian
consumers’ right to choose their internet devices.</p>

<h3>Certification requirements against Router Freedom</h3>

<p>As we warned back in October 2024, the incumbent operator in Italy,
TIM, has introduced <a href="/news/2024/news-20241016-01.html">certification
procedures</a> for wholesale fiber routers in the Italian market,
creating barriers to market entry, limiting consumer
choice, and ultimately undermining Net Neutrality.
We urged AGCOM to push industry actors to explore
alternative ways to cover certification
costs without shifting the burden onto consumers.
Instead of restrictive measures, voluntary,
non-discriminatory certification schemes that align with
internationally recognized standards should be
promoted to ensure fair competition and technological neutrality.</p>

<h3>Engaging with our Italian community: an effort for
Router Freedom</h3>

<p>During the whole process, the FSFE was supported by a network of
stakeholders ranging from savvy volunteers, Linux User Groups, maker
spaces, consumer organisations, to industry representatives. We activated
individuals and friend organisations to take part in the consultation
and raise their voice in favour of Router Freedom. We are grateful to
all these people who support us and engage in such complex technical and
legal procedures in defence of consumers.</p>
