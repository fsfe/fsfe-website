      <p>Fairphone invites a panel of experts to explore the underlying forces that drive the continuing decline in the longevity of phones and other electronics. Erik Albers, FSFE's programme manager digital sustainability, joins the panel and gives insights on the sustainability of Free Software and how the universal right to install Free Software operating systems on any device will help us to live a more sustainable digital society. The live webinar takes place on 15 March 2022 from 14:00 - 15:00 CET and it is in English. Attendance is free but you need to register. </p>
