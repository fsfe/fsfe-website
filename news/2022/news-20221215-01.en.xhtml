<p>
  The Belgian regulator BIPT has decided to safeguard Router Freedom 
  for all connection types, including optical fiber (FTTx). The FSFE 
  engaged in the public consultation urging policy makers to make this 
  right a reality, and to improve monitoring over ISP practices.
</p>

<p>
  Since 2018, EU countries have been reforming their telecommunications 
  law, passing new rules concerning network infrastructure and internet 
  devices, including authority over routers and modems. This process 
  has been long and fragmented, leading to diverse outcomes that in 
  some cases <a href="/news/2021/news-20210805-01.html">benefit 
  end-users</a>, but in others represent a <a href="/news/2021/news-20211027-01.html">serious threat</a> against 
  the right to choose and use personal routers/modems. In November 
  2022, the Belgian the telecom regulator BIPT <a href="https://www.bipt.be/operatoren/publication/raadpleging-over-een-ontwerpbesluit-betreffende-de-identificering-van-het-netwerkaansluitpunt-voor-de-breedbanddiensten-en-tv-diensten">drafted 
  a regulatory framework</a> for consolidating <a href="/activities/routers/routers.html">Router Freedom</a> in the 
  country. The FSFE welcomed the bold step and urged the policy maker 
  to translate this right into reality by upscaling monitoring over 
  internet service providers’ (ISP) practices against end-users.
</p>

<h3 id="belgian-proposal-checked-all-boxes">Belgian proposal checked all boxes</h3>

<p>
  The FSFE acknowledged BIPT’s regulatory proposal as a solution with a 
  high potential to consolidate Router Freedom for end-users. BIPT 
  plans to set the <a href="/news/2020/news-20200601-01.html">location 
  of the “network termination point” at Point A</a> for all types of 
  internet connections, including optical fiber. This choice of 
  position translates into Router Freedom, meaning that end-users will 
  be able to choose and use their own equipment. BIPT’s decision 
  represents a benefit for end-users by clearly defining the boundaries 
  of private and public networks – which have direct impact on the 
  provision of internet services.

<p>
  BIPT delivered a balanced document, providing an in-depth analysis of 
  the technological criteria that the EU legislation allows decision 
  makers to use to limit Router Freedom. The Belgian regulator took an 
  exemplary position confirming FSFE’s longstanding position that no 
  technological reason was identified as a significant threat to the 
  public network’s security or integrity in Belgium or any other 
  country that safeguarded Router Freedom.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE agrees with the conclusions achieved by BIPT that Router 
  Freedom has not led to a substantial reduction in the quality of 
  service for end-users. We have been <a href="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/router-freedom-tracker_581123#4/53.09/18.37">monitoring 
  the regulatory panorama</a> in Europe and confirmed that the 
  experiences in Finland, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands serve as 
  positive examples that devices chosen by end-users do not cause 
  damage for network operators or end-users.
</p>

<p>
  Most importantly, BIPT’s position encompasses all fixed network 
  topologies, including optical fiber networks (FTTx), allowing 
  end-users to deploy their own private equipment without the necessity 
  of a media converter or upstream provider modem from ISPs. This is a 
  major win for consumer protection, raising the bar for other 
  countries to follow this example, mostly because other regulators 
  have explicitly decided to <a href="/news/2022/news-20220628-01.html">exclude Router Freedom from 
  fiber networks</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE took part in the consultation (<a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-bipt-ntp-en.pdf">EN</a>)(<a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-bipt-ntp-nl.pdf">NL</a>), 
  and backed up BIPT’s solution by arguing that for reasons of freedom 
  of choice, privacy and data protection, interoperability, fair 
  competition, and security, end-users must have the possibility to use 
  their own routers/modems. We also demonstrated how Router Freedom is 
  a valuable factor for digital sustainability.

<p>
  Setting the position of the NTP and allowing end-users to use their 
  routers/modems is not enough for effectively implementing Router 
  Freedom. Based on our experience and the reports we have received 
  over the years from the community, we highlighted to BIPT that more 
  than being a technical issue, freedom of terminal equipment 
  represents a policy demand and requires constant monitoring of ISPs’ 
  commercial practices. End-user reports relate to ISPs’ practices that 
  jeopardize this freedom, especially when:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Customers are forbidden to use their equipment by contract or ISPs impose disproportional disadvantages to users with private router;</li>
  <li>ISPs do not inform customers about their rights regarding terminal equipment or manipulate users through their customer service in favour of the ISP’s routers;</li>
  <li>ISPs advertise their routers as the only ones compatible with the network, or use non-standard plugs or proprietary protocols;</li>
  <li>ISPs do not provide users the login data to the public network or make no support available to customers.</li>
  <li>ISPs do not offer the same level of service (e.g. IPv6, bandwidth, etc) for customers using their own router.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="community-support-was-key">Community support was key</h3>

<p>
  The FSFE’s engagement in the consultation process was empowered by a 
  network of supporters, volunteers, and supporting organisations in 
  Belgium. Our Router Freedom <a href="https://survey.fsfe.org/index.php/628449">survey</a> counted 
  valuable insights and feedback from 260 participants (from the 1036 
  who reported their country of residence). The responses helped us to 
  understand better the issues end-users suffer in relation to their 
  ISPs. Survey responses were especially important for issues regarding 
  fiber networks and the respective optical equipment imposed by 
  network operators. Besides, the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/BNL">FSFE Benelux team</a> 
  proactively fostered exchange with supporting organisations that were 
  sensitive to the cause, providing feedback and dedicating efforts for 
  submitting their position to the regulator, including the industry 
  representative <a href="https://vtke.eu/">VTKE</a>, the consumer 
  organisation <a href="https://www.test-achats.be/">Test Achats</a>, 
  the privacy group <a href="https://ministryofprivacy.eu/">Ministry of 
  Privacy</a>, and the network association <a href="https://neutrinet.be/en">Neutrinet</a>.
