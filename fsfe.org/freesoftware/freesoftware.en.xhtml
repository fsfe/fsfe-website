    <h1>What is Free Software</h1>
    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
        The principles of Free Software are simple but it is important
        to not get confused by the underlying complexity caused by its
        long history. Learn about the <a href="#freedoms">four
        freedoms</a> and their meaning, the fundamentals about <a href="#licences">Free Software licences</a>, the <a href="#advantages">advantages</a> that Free Software provides,
        and the most common <a href="#synonyms">synonyms</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking beyond the circle of software itself, you can read more about
        the interplay of Free Software with <a href="#more">other fields</a>
        like education, procurement and democracy.

    <h2 id="freedoms">The Four Freedoms</h2>

    <p>
      Free Software refers to freedom, not price. It guarantees its users the
      essential four freedoms. The absence of at least one of these freedoms
      means an application is proprietary, so non‐Free Software.

    <h2 id="licences">Licences</h2>

    <p>
      The four freedoms are given by a software licence. Software licences
      define the conditions under which a programme can be used and reused. For
      it to be Free Software, the licence text must contain at least the four
      freedoms. The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">Free Software
      Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/category">Open Source Initiative</a>
      maintain lists of reviewed and approved licences. An application can
      usually not be considered Free Software if its licence does not appear in
      one of these lists.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a multitude of licences with different focuses, and a software
      product or parts of it can also be licensed under more than one licence.
      The actual selection is a strategic question but you are advised to pick
      one of the most widely used licences. For more insights on legal and
      licensing questions, you can <a class="learn-more" href="/freesoftware/legal/faq.html">Read more...</a>

    <h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

    <!-- adopted from PMPC brochure p.16+17 -->

    <p>
      Free Software is about freedom. In practice, this provides numerous
      advantages for users, organisations, businesses, and governments.

    <h2 id="synonyms">Synonyms</h2>

    <p>
      Over the course of time, people came up with additional labels for Free
      Software. Often the motivation for these terms is to highlight different
      aspects and to avoid confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Free Software was first defined with the four freedoms mentioned above by
      the <a href="/freesoftware/gnuproject.html">GNU project</a> in 1986. In
      1998, "Open Source" was set up as a marketing campaign for Free
      Software but with the same freedoms in mind. Other widely known labels for
      Free Software are "Libre Software", initiated to avoid the ambiguity of
      the English word "free", and "FOSS" or "FLOSS" as abbreviations for "Free
      (Libre) Open Source Software".
    </p>

    <p>
      The level of freedom particular software offers is always determined by
      the licence, not the label. In other words, don’t get confused by
      different terms for the same features. If you are interested in the
      historical background and why we prefer the original term, you can <a class="learn-more" href="/freesoftware/comparison.html">Read more...</a>
    </p>

    <p>
There are also terms that are commonly misused as synonyms to describe Free Software. “Public Domain” is one of such terms, and it is important to maintain a distinction between Free Software and public domain. Put in simple terms, the public domain consists of all creative work (including software) to which no copyright applies. The rights to these works may have expired, been expressly waived, or may be inapplicable. While these are the very general principles behind the public domain, the decisive factor of what constitutes public domain will always be determined by the legal principles in the country in which a work is to be used.
</p>

<p>
While software in the public domain certainly can overlap with the aims of Free Software, as a rule, Free Software is not synonymous with public domain. Indeed, most of Free Software is bound by the rules of copyright. Especially in the European Union, the existing copyright and patent systems make it difficult to identify a work under the public domain accurately. To avoid ambiguities in how you intend to share a piece of work, it therefore is preferable to use a Free Software licence rather than placing the work in the public domain, as a Free Software licence is able to provide clear and comprehensible legal information on the rights and obligations involved in using that software.

    <h2 id="more">Further Insights</h2>

    <p>
      The numerous advantages of Free Software are a benefit in themselves, but also contribute positively to other technical and non-technical fields. Since the FSFE's foundation in 2001, we have been exploring different areas and how Free Software can make a difference.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="/freesoftware/standards/">Open Standards</a></strong>: Open
        Standards allow people to share all kinds of data freely and with

        <strong><a href="/freesoftware/education/">Education</a></strong>: Free

        <strong><a href="/freesoftware/procurement/">Public
        Procurement</a></strong>: Free Software is a perfect fit for the public
        sector. It is a public resource that government organisations can use,
        study, improve, and share with each other. For citizens, this means
        transparency, cost efficiency, and the freedom to interact with their
        government in the way that suits them best.

        <strong><a href="/freesoftware/developmentcooperation/">International
        development cooperation</a></strong> is concerned with the sustainable
        improvement of global economic, social, ecological and political
        conditions. Free Software is becoming an indispensable fundamental
        technology that guarantees legally compliant international cooperation
        and reuse - a technology that enables global scaling with simultaneous
        local adaptability.

        <strong><a href="/freesoftware/artificial-intelligence.html">Artificial
        Intelligence</a></strong> (AI) has made enormous developments in the
        last few years and it will not slow down – rather the opposite. While AI
        applications benefit the lives of many citizens, they may also undermine
        our ability to control technology and put fundamental freedoms at risk.
        We explore how releasing AI applications under Free Software licences
        paves the way for more accessibility, transparency, and fairness.

      <li>
        <strong><a href="/activities/swpat/swpat.html">Ending Software
        Patents</a></strong> is a measure in which we can achieve a world where
        software users are able to participate in the development and
        distribution of software. Software patents add legal and financial risks
        to software development and distribution by giving patent holders
        legal power to prohibit software developers from using patented ideas.
        The result of this is that software patents are ultimately harmful to
        innovation, the economy, and to society.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">Sustainability</a></strong>:
        Everyone can use Free Software without limitations from the
        past, today, and in the future. As demonstrated in our short study, with Free Software we can
        maintain programs and prevent software obsolescence. We can
        repair and repurpose hardware, extending their lifetime and
        saving natural resources.
