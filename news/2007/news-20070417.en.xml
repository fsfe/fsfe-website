    <body>
The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is committed to working 
with lawyers throughout Europe to maximise the legal security of Free 
Software and is aware that as the community matures it is important to 
be able to locate professional legal advice.  For this reason FSFE has 
introduced a new policy for recommending legal experts in individual 
countries.
