    <title>3rd International GPLv3 Conference, Barcelona</title>
    <body>
      <p>
      At this two day international conference, the experts on GPLv3
      and Free Software licencing will present the proposed changes to
      Free Software's corner stone licence, the GNU General Public
      License.  The experts will also take questions from attendees
      and topical discussions will be organised.  The joint goals are
      to raise awareness of the GPLv3 process and to give attendees
      the information necessary to explain the proposed changes to
      others.
