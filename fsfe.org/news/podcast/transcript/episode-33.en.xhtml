1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
If we then look at a U.P. level, we have a commissioner for tax opportunities or also make sense

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,000
to have a ministry in Germany that is, so to say, account the part to this.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,840
So I think the time is now to come up with something like this, that's for sure.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,480
But it's absolutely unclear how strong this ministry will be, what's the scope and

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,120
accept the person and this also something important, you need somebody who is not only

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:47,560
becoming the needed knowledge, but also with the engagement and power to come up with change.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,720
Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast, this podcast is presented to you by the Free Software

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
Foundation Europe.

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,480
We are a charity that empowers users to take control of technology.

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm Bonnie Mehring, and today I'm here with Alexander Sander.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,880
Alex, who has now been a regular guest on this podcast, is the Senior Policy Consultant

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,760
for the FSFE.

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,120
And in his work for the FSFE, he monitors the happenings in the European Union and also pushes

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,760
for the recognition of Free Software.

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,480
Together, we will cover the latest developments at Germany in regard to the policy and

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,320
the Coalition Treaty in Germany.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,000
This treaty was formed by the Conservative parties, CDU and CSU, and the social democrats

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,320
called SPD in Germany.

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
Thank you, Alex, for being here.

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,200
Thank you so much for making the time and to walking us through the Coalition Treaty and also

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
the latest developments.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Thank you very much.

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,120
Yeah, thanks for having me.

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,920
So Alex, this treaty has now been out for around a week, as far as I remember.

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,240
What is your first take on this treaty?

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,440
I guess it might have some spill over effect on the European Union as well.

27
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,640
How do you think that this looks like?

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:15,280
Yeah, so I mean, we studied the treaty and there are definitely some things that most likely

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,440
will also have an impact on the European Union and its Germany as a large member state

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
of the European Union.

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,440
It's also important to learn what the Germans are about to do in the next four years.

32
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,440
And that's why this Coalition Treaty is not only important for Germany, but also for the

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
European Union.

34
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,040
In particular, then there are also some references to the European Union, how they want

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,040
to collaborate on the topic of Free Software.

36
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,800
And yeah, for example, coming up with a shared deck and stuff like this.

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,680
And yeah, let's dive into this and discuss a bit what we will see in the next four years

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,520
in Germany, but also in the European Union.

39
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:03,400
And yeah, what to expect this will be pretty interesting as the devil is Austin in the

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
detail.

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,960
I can imagine, and there are over 140 sides to this whole treaty.

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,400
But how many sides are specifically on digital policies and the new digital minister?

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,640
Well, I mean, it's for us it's not that important how many sides it's more on what

44
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
they say.

45
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:32,920
And here there are just a few sentences that shed light on the topic of Free Software.

46
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:40,160
And there are some also some other topics or words they use that also can contribute

47
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
to this topic.

48
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,720
And this is what we are going to analyze now.

49
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,800
I mean, also you mentioned that there will be a new ministry.

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,480
And that also sort of important, but also here, it depends on like what the scope of this

51
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,280
ministry, how strong will the ministry be, also in the context to other ministries.

52
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:08,040
And then ultimately, who is leading this ministry and how ambitious is this person towards

53
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,920
the goals that are not only in the treaty, but also in general, the knowledge and ambitions

54
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,880
of this person that are also something which should be recognized by analyzing and analyzing

55
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
this treaty.

56
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:29,160
That let's start with what's in it on Free Software, in the treaty, they talk about open

57
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
source.

58
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,800
And I mean, it's first of all, what's interesting is that they want to collaborate with

59
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:43,400
private and public actors in order to promote open source ecosystem, which is quite okay,

60
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,120
I'd say, and it's also a reasonable goal.

61
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,360
I mean, that's something we have seen in the past.

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,800
Not only in private actors, we also need public actors, we need public funding, for example,

63
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,520
we need procurement, all of these topics we already discussed in the podcast on funding,

64
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,680
but also on the procurement rules.

65
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,920
We have the campaign public money, public code, which is asking government basically to release

66
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,720
everything under Free Software Light and as soon as you invest public money in software.

67
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,640
So there are already some step forward in the last years that also the German government

68
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,920
understood that Free Software plays an important role to reach digital sovereignty to have

69
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:38,400
a resilient IT infrastructure to be independent and to come out, for example, out of

70
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,400
vandalizing.

71
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:46,320
So that's what also the upcoming government understood that also what is reflected in the

72
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,480
treaty, in the coalition treaty, however, if we then look at what they want to do

73
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,680
precisely, then it's getting a bit vague.

74
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:03,280
So for example, they say that they want to define ambitious goals on the topic of open source,

75
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,920
which means that they didn't define it yet.

76
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,520
So the only thing that they agreed on is that they want to be ambitious and that this needs

77
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,720
to be defined.

78
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,800
So we can already see that they are like upcoming work for us.

79
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,840
I can't imagine.

80
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,840
So this is something that is in the whole treaty, as far as I have here and rat in all of the

81
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:33,120
upper resources, that this is something which is a lot in this coalition treaty that there

82
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:40,720
are not specific goals or specific details, but that's more of a let's talk about this later

83
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,240
attitude and we will just kind of like do this.

84
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,200
How do you see this in regard to Free Software?

85
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:53,600
Do you think that Free Software has a strong stand in the treaty or will be undermined?

86
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,040
That's actually in regard to open washing as well.

87
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,800
Yeah, I mean, in general, that's why it's such a long treaty, I think.

88
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,120
So since they didn't manage it to precisely agree on things, they had to describe things a lot.

89
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,160
So that's why I also think there's upcoming work for us.

90
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,920
I mean, the good thing is that they say they want to be ambitious.

91
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:25,520
So that's something that we can also follow up and where we can or where we need to follow up and see

92
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,920
what this means in practice.

93
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:35,280
Also, they give already some insights for example that they say they want to work with the sender

94
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,520
of digital sovereignty, for example, or the surrender agency, they also want to collaborate

95
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,880
a U.P. and why they also want to come up with a so-called German stack which should be

96
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,480
somehow collaborate and be embedded in the U-Stack initiative in Europe.

97
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,080
So we can also already see that they have important actors on the radar and that they also

98
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,840
see that they need to collaborate. So that's something which is very, very good and very, very useful

99
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,440
and also needed. So in this regard, I'd say they found the right spot where they need to work

100
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:17,520
on what is missing is concrete goals. So for example, we want to see that 20% of the budget

101
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:25,440
is to be invested in Free Software, for example, or that we want to remove and 30% of our

102
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,280
window looking for something like this. So this is what's missing. The only reference we have

103
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,920
is that it needs to be ambitious. So if you look at this word, I think it's fair to say

104
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,920
we should compare it to what we're done in the past. So this means it needs to be better than the

105
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,800
last government. So else it wouldn't be ambitious, right? So it's not about keeping the status quo,

106
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,400
but they say want to be ambitious, it needs to be better than before. So I think that's somehow

107
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:03,360
the threshold what we are looking for and so this is at least the bare minimum what we can expect

108
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,400
or what we should expect from the next government and this is then also I do believe something for

109
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:17,520
as soon as we have the new government where we need to follow up is then to make sure that the goals

110
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,360
that are defined are becoming one of the priorities of the next government. So as you also said

111
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,520
if you look at the coalition treaty in general, it's not only in the topic of Free Software

112
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,680
but in many other topics as well that they are remaining very vague and that they are not very

113
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,600
clear on their priorities. So it's absolutely unclear if they want to be ambitious in the beginning

114
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,480
of their legislative firm or in the end for example. So and this is on us as the whole Free Software

115
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,440
community to make sure that this topic is becoming a priority and if you look at the other

116
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,880
member states in the European Union and the European Union itself it also makes sense to bring

117
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,640
pressure to it since the others are also working on this and it doesn't make sense to be the last one

118
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,560
in the party but to join the party early and in particular for Germany it makes sense since they

119
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,160
already came up with solution like open desk and open code with the center of digital sovereignty

120
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:27,200
in the past to continue this path and to at the needed resources for this to go there and this is

121
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,320
another very important thing it's about budget. So also they talk about budget for these activities

122
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,560
and here they say they want to provide the needed resources but they don't say anything on how much

123
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:48,240
and when. So and this is also a huge problem also here in general for the whole coalition treaty

124
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,400
and they didn't talk about money they just say we want to do this we want to do this we want to do this

125
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,440
if there is the money for this so and this makes it absolutely complicated since it's also not

126
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,200
clear again where they put their priorities to and also it's not clear where the money should come

127
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,800
for so it could be easy for them to say for like every topic they have in the coalition treaty

128
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,080
yes always sorry we don't have the money and this is again on other countries they put in this

129
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,760
very important sentence that I would also like to highlight because this is like this is

130
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:35,360
saying that will define the whole work of this coalition is to sentence if we have the money for it

131
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,400
and I find this very fascinating because this puts a lot of power to define an actual ministry

132
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,280
you're not only to the financial ministry but it's pretty clear that there will be huge discussions

133
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,480
between the ministry itself right so it's not then that the ministry of finance just distributed

134
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,520
to the money as he likes but there will be also discussions between the ministry the ministry of

135
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:04,800
economics the fight the ministry of environment for simply for resources and this also means that

136
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,280
there is a completely new ministry as you at in the beginning right this ministry of digital things

137
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,360
let's say it like this so it's also not I have you don't know the name exactly yeah

138
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,440
it's a country yeah so let's say the digital ministry so we don't know the name we don't know who is

139
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,680
going to run it and even worse we don't know the scope of this ministry so and it's also pretty

140
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,880
unclear how much power it will have how important it will be and how strong they can fight or defend

141
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,720
topics they work on so this is all very unclear at the moment and this is also where we

142
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,920
have huge debate or whether it's the huge debate and I mean you can pretty much compare with the

143
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:55,680
this German Bundestag so there two terms ago they introduced the committee for digital affairs

144
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,120
so where they want to discuss digital topics in a specific committee but this was not a leading

145
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,960
committee but just like a consulting committee so it didn't have the needed power to really

146
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,840
have a stance on digital topics so they have been absolute expert in this committee and they

147
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,600
talked about the right things I think however they didn't have the power to make that much change

148
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,400
also there was a missing ministry on the other hand this is now added I think that's a good thing

149
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:32,240
so that we have basically in the parliament a committee and we are also on the other hand have a

150
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,880
ministry also again if we then look at the U.P. level we have a commissioner for tax opportunities

151
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,360
or also make sense to have a ministry in Germany that is so to say account the part to this so I

152
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,280
think the time is now to come up with something like this that's for sure but it's absolutely unclear

153
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,440
how strong this ministry will be what the scope and accept the person and this also something important

154
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,560
you need somebody who is not only coming with the needed knowledge but also with the engagement

155
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:12,400
and power to come up with change and so therefore it's difficult to say at the minute where all of

156
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,960
this will end and land at one point and as you said on the other hand we have this issue of

157
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:26,080
finding things all of this and so it's the worst case is that we end up with these nice words but

158
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,000
then they say we are sorry there is no money but on the other hand I do believe that there's also

159
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,080
a huge pressure coming from other member states and the U.P. union also like from external partners

160
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,920
we see how important it is to have independent infrastructure we can rely on and the only

161
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,240
answer to this is setting up such infrastructure which is software and I also do believe that more

162
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,960
and more decision makers understand the need for software and I mean that this is basically the only

163
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,440
solution since they also and this is interesting they talk about open standards for example

164
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,440
and that they want to define them so and also they use words like indoor mobility,

165
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,160
U.P. in collaboration around software also we have some things on education that we talk about

166
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:24,240
resilience, digital sovereignty and all these words has been also used heavily in debate about

167
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,400
the attacks of our energy about like how we can independent from in particular external partners

168
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:38,880
that are not coming from the U.P. union and how we can make sure that there is so to say proper

169
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:45,920
U.P. in IT market so and if you look at all this description they come up so how this market

170
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:53,600
should look like and and how for example public administrations should use IT then you can only

171
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,600
come up with the is the saying that this is only possible with software or so you can't have an

172
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,920
interoperable U.P. in administrations so to say without Free Software so since you always want

173
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:13,440
into close standards you run into vendor not in if you don't use Free Software so if you

174
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,480
as you are as we have seen in the past using this proper territory solution so then you are stuck

175
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,520
and you can't collaborate you can't be interoperable and for this so even if they don't

176
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,440
precisely talk about Free Software open source they want to collaborate they want to be

177
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,800
interoperable and this I say is only possible with Free Software and this is then also something

178
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,800
where we as Free Software community need to step in and make sure that this is reflected once they

179
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,440
start working on this so they give us also some ideas some things where they want to

180
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,840
for example collaborate on U.P. in level on this on this stack so there are some some ideas

181
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,120
some are called one stack a U.S. stack then we have national stacks so in the coalition treaty

182
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,200
they talk about a German stack but they also recognize that it's absolutely meaningless to do this

183
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:17,520
in silos but to collaborate on this and this collaboration so to come up with a U.P. in stack

184
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:25,040
where member states and different actors, private and public actors contribute to such a stack

185
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,760
this could only be done with the software since the four freedoms to use study share and improve

186
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,720
allow this collaboration any other property thing wouldn't allow this wouldn't allow

187
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,920
interoperability and therefore the path could only be Free Software solution to work with and it's on

188
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,880
the other hand important for us to to discuss this things we also see other discussions happening

189
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,760
on the U.P. in the moment that are coming with slogans like by European or things like this

190
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,280
which is also a something in particular if you look at the software market or not over there

191
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:13,120
the Free Software market there is nothing like a national IT right so our IT is global

192
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,240
it was global it will remain global so else we can't run our infrastructure without open standards

193
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,200
we wouldn't have the internet for example and this is then also true for every other system so we

194
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,120
need to have open standards and for interoperability and collaboration we need a global approach

195
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,760
however if you look at the market you will also see that in in particular if you invest in

196
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:46,560
Free Software you will often end up with SMEs and if you procure in Europe Free Software you will

197
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:54,560
also most likely end up with European SMEs so you don't need this slogan by European if you say

198
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,760
we want to invest in Free Software and that's something where I fear that decision makers

199
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,480
haven't understood this correctly at the moment but this is then something we need to work on

200
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,960
and the term in the next term in the next four years on the national level but also on a European level

201
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,760
to make clear that if you want to have like a European stack where the European commission

202
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,920
together with the member states collaborate on such a solution that this is only possible with

203
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,840
software and if you do this you will also most likely end up with a lot of European SMEs which

204
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,800
just then also good for the European market but also we have spill over effect in the topics

205
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:43,360
the coalition treaty also talks about namely skills resilient consumers since they then will get

206
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:51,120
also the tools which are developed for public administration and can reuse them for example

207
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:59,920
in the civil society organizations but also this is what I highlighted in a Bundestag theory in December

208
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:07,600
think about fire fighters think about hospitals they also need infrastructure and we should also

209
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,480
give them resilient infrastructure and not a proprietary software coming from non-European countries

210
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:23,440
absolutely absolutely so to put a phrase on this all there are a lot of possibilities basically

211
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,600
for Free Software industry but none of it is yet sure and it's definitely a task for the

212
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:37,680
digital civil society to take a careful eye on this to watch this and to see what actually

213
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:43,920
happening and to also push for Free Software. Absolutely we can feed the coalition treaty as a

214
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,920
starting point to fight for goals like public money public code to fight for funding and

215
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:56,880
publicly discuss in a recent podcast together but also to make sure that educational resources or

216
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,440
that education in general has an eye on Free Software and that all of these words like

217
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,360
interoperability and so on and so forth are filled with Free Software so these are the tasks so

218
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,280
even if they are just a few mentions of the term open source in the coalition treaty there are

219
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,520
still many other points where if you read it correctly you the answer could only be Free Software

220
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,080
and this is what we need to make sure that decision makers understand if you want to have

221
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,440
digital sovereignty you can only do this with Free Software as exchange to the

222
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,680
nature of the free ones and that will be the most challenging task in the next four years and then

223
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:45,600
I've metly putting money to this. Yes this of course I also have another question now

224
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:54,080
not I found really interesting the recently had as symposium for public money public code

225
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,760
and a lot of people were invited to this and a lot of people showed up what is your feeling

226
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,080
currently is the understanding of Free Software and especially to need to invest public money

227
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:14,000
in public code what's your feeling there how is this moving ahead and how is it going and what

228
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,760
are the latest happenings here yeah so with this event public money public code in practice we

229
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:28,080
brought together mainly local administrations regional administrations with players from national

230
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:37,360
level and civil society to discuss how we can collaborate and how we can learn from collaboration

231
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:44,320
of others how we can network what is already out there where we can build on and I think this is

232
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,240
all to something which we can reuse for the next four years so as the coalition to it it talks

233
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,080
about public and private collaboration I also do believe that we should have the layer of civil

234
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:03,440
society to this and research since there is already also a lot of experience on how to collaborate

235
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:11,280
on and yeah using a strategies and ideas as proof print and this is something we need to make

236
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,200
way more use out of it so the benefit of using Free Software is that we don't have to reinvent the

237
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,680
wheel and this is not only true for the code itself but also for processes and how we get there

238
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,120
so in this is something where we I think waste a lot of resources since public administrations from

239
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:40,080
time to time try to yeah or are used to work in silos and they have to adapt their workflows,

240
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:47,520
their style of working towards a way more collaborative attitude and this is something where we

241
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,040
can learn from others so and this is also nice that the coalition treaty talks about this collaboration

242
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,480
so that they want to collaborate with other member states with other public administrations and

243
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,680
here I think this was shown in this symposium that there is already a lot out there which we can

244
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,640
reuse where we can build on and this is something which we can bring into the debate and show

245
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:18,320
pace so how well all of this is already established in some areas and for us it's important

246
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,000
that we shed light on these actors that has been always disrespectful and that we learn from them

247
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,360
and I do believe that this symposium brought together these people and shed some light on this

248
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,960
and this is something what we learned we need more and not only in Germany but also in

249
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,080
other member states and we need to make sure that these people interact and I think that will be

250
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:50,160
also key for the next five or four years depending on the Europe Germany is to make sure that

251
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,560
the actors that want to get active collaborate talk to each other and learn from each other

252
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:03,040
and in this regard these events help and this is also something where I do believe that

253
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,400
some money should go so if we talk about resources we do not only talk about technical

254
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,720
solution in the end we should always also look at the community around and this community I

255
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,720
do not necessarily mean the community we talk about but also the community's other talks about so

256
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,960
if you look for example at the center of digital reality their community is mainly companies

257
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,840
why so they need to bring together different companies that had to develop this open desk solution

258
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:44,160
if you look at Munich for example they collaborate with consul which is a tool which allows

259
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,840
participation for citizens and here they came up with a sponsorship since this is a foundation

260
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,280
and since you can't easily procure from them and this is also something we learn so

261
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:04,640
other than classical procurement procedures we need also to go other ways to work together with

262
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,320
the different communities and to come up with good solutions and it's not like that we if you

263
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,000
I don't know go on a market for chairs or something like this you just go there by the best chair

264
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,440
and then pull stop right so and you have right basically one vendor you talk to and then this is good

265
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,400
but if you talk about Free Software you can't just go to a market and procure something

266
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,120
sometimes you have to come up with other solutions you have to think about sponsorship you have to

267
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:38,400
think about giving the nation or just like a small amount of money into communities

268
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:45,520
to make something happen so and this needs a rethinking and for this rethinking we should learn

269
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,600
from strategies of others who already had good experience with this and where we don't have to

270
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,880
reinvent the wheel so to say not in the IT itself but in how we collaborate with the Free Software

271
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,560
ecosystem and this is something where the symposium shed a lot of light on and where we basically

272
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,760
where there was also a lot of agreement that you need to go other paths of collaboration

273
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,800
yeah that we know from the past for the fact all right that sounds very interesting and like

274
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:26,480
something we should have visited yeah so but we try to do more of these kind of events and also

275
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:34,240
I mean we have around public money public code it's easy to to get around and to like learn what

276
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,600
we are doing in this area and to collaborate with us so yeah join us in these kind of events

277
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,800
contribute to this and also do believe that this is something more or less everyone can do so

278
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,840
if you talk about Free Software it's not that much anymore that you need to explain people

279
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,320
the concept of Free Software but whether or not like that there is way more than code and

280
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,640
I mean we also have seen this with the corona tracing at the very site so

281
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,400
ultimately it was not that much about the code it was about the different communities that came

282
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,480
together to come up with a ultimately technical solution yeah but it was not only technically

283
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,680
people coming together and this is something what we can learn and more for that one absolutely so

284
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,080
and this is basically where we are today and what we need to explain so if you talk about

285
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,760
European interoperability we should not talk about technical communities coming together

286
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:34,960
but communities that are needed to come up with a good solution no in regard to who was there

287
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,160
at this symposium I would love to talk a bit more about Sanders because Sanders is also mentioned

288
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:47,360
in the coalition treaty and there has been the first personal decision made there can you

289
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:54,560
shed some light on yeah so this is basically the first very sad story also this is also

290
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:00,960
a bit strange so to say so during this event we we had the CEO of the Center of the Children's

291
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:08,400
Organities of the 10th and 30th of a limited in German and Jutta Horstmann she also gave a very good

292
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,400
keynote and she also was on the panel with us discussing all of these questions I was just

293
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:22,880
referring to and now she was removed from this position just the very next day after our symposium

294
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,040
so we do believe that there is no direct connection to what she was saying there

295
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:35,440
I do have some but I mean in general we yeah just learn about this the very next day after

296
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,240
she was at our event that yeah she was removed from this position or to there is not anyone

297
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,120
new to be assigned to this position and also it was a bit unclear why she was removed so there

298
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,960
has been statements from the Ministry of Interior who basically sent the CEO to this

299
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,920
Center of the Children's Organities and they were just saying like since we need to re-structure

300
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:10,000
we need to remove her which as we then go back to the beginning of this podcast doesn't make too

301
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,600
much sense since he still don't know the scope of everything right so and I doubt that the

302
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,720
Ministry of Interior is the one who comes up with the cabinet and will learn about how all of these

303
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,480
structure will look like so it rather looks like that they yeah use this moment to all by the

304
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:37,600
remove people that are not fully in line with what they are planning to do and this definitely

305
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:44,800
fears us so I think Jutta has done a very good job the University of the Children's Organities

306
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,880
she was also in the hearing in the German Bundestag explaining all the challenges that the

307
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:58,000
Center is facing at the moment however what we learn is that the new to the new formed Ministry

308
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:06,080
of the Children's whatever and so it's going to the Conservatives so the city will and since Jutta was

309
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:13,680
also a Queen Party member it might be that it was rather a political decision but what's happening

310
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:24,960
here then one based on what she has done and what she was planning to do so and in this regard we

311
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,360
definitely fear that Jutta will be replaced by someone who's not that much of an expert so we didn't

312
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,480
learn from from today on who will be the new person or the new CEO for for tennis and this

313
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:45,520
also looks a bit to me that it was a rather a very quick decision that was taken then a very

314
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:54,400
reflected decision and in particular as a such an important topic we also need stable decisions

315
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:04,800
we need a continuation of things rather than people politics and power politics so and here it will

316
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:11,600
be definitely interesting to see if this change of the of the CEO position will also then

317
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,600
automatically come with changes in structures so until now we didn't learn anything about it

318
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,280
and also who's who's the next CEO of tennis and what will be the priorities of this person

319
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,720
so and for us it's important that we continue the good path that the tennis continues the

320
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,760
good collaboration they already started this European partner I think that something that they

321
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,920
just recently kicked off so that they are not working in the silo but that they collaborate not only

322
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:46,320
with in Germany with several public administrations on several levels what they are already

323
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,760
doing but that they also collaborate this European partner I think that's very important

324
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,560
and here we need to make sure that they don't lose ground and that they don't lose power

325
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:03,600
that they get the needed resources and also that they still do this good Free Software work

326
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,720
and that they don't start open motion so because this is also something we fear so if you go

327
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,400
through the coalition treaty and if you see a set is by European initiatives

328
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,480
the auto fear that there will be a lot of open motion around this and this is also why we need to

329
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:28,240
be still active in our watchdog roads this is a short break for our own cause thank you for

330
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,000
listening to the software feed-in podcast working for software feed-in and producing podcasts

331
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,960
cost money please consider supporting us with a donation on the fsfe.org/donate

332
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:48,640
and then the show knows and this is also why we need to be still active in our watchdog roads

333
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,720
we have seen this with data port phoenix back in the days in Germany so the very first attempt to

334
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,160
come up with a so-called open source solution for public administrations we have eaten

335
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:06,240
checked for the licenses and figured out that this is not really open source what they are doing

336
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,760
but rather open motion so we hope we don't have to do this for for other solutions that the

337
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:19,040
German government so to say is coming up for so but that we make sure that this is really

338
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,000
Free Software what they are coming up with and that they continue the good past they just started

339
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,400
and that these ambitious goals that it needs to be set up are really ambitious and not watered

340
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:37,520
down in any way or that they end up with doing power politics and discussing people instead of

341
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:44,560
topics so this is something we need to make sure in this regard so this very first decision

342
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,080
basically so to remove yourself from this position was what's very strange to say

343
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,240
yeah absolutely I absolutely can understand especially in light that as you already mentioned

344
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,160
we do not really know what will be happening and we will only find us out doing the

345
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,920
coalition of those three parties and doing the formation of the German government so

346
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,400
it's really curious to see what what are the next steps what is the scope that will be there

347
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,120
for the digital ministry and also how Free Software will stand be as Free Software

348
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:25,280
foundation Europe and especially you will probably pay a lot of attention there is this correct

349
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,520
can we say this to our listeners that you will be there and you will watch that

350
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:38,960
yes absolutely also I will do this together with my colleague Johannes who is also very

351
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,280
actively working in Germany on all of these topics so and we also organized this symposium in

352
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,560
in essence Germany on the public money public code topic again and he also follows a lot

353
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,480
the topic of open washing he also already gave a lot of talks on this so he is also an absolute expert

354
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:04,560
on this so and in this regard also that this is a continuous call to our community if you see

355
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,680
these cases of open washing or if you see any cases where you say well this is against the

356
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,120
goals of the software foundation Europe or the Free Software ecosystem let us know right

357
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:21,280
of the email to contact us if it is or reach out for us directly on social networks or when

358
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:28,080
we are on conferences so help us to shed light on on these topics so because this also helps us

359
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:35,840
explaining and the issues to decision makers and making sure that they come up with these ambitious

360
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,680
goals that are really contributing to a Free Software ecosystem and not something which is

361
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:48,800
like basically open wash Alex thank you so much for your work thank you so much for your time here
