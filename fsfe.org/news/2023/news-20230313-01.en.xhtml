<h1>  Greece adopts new rules on Router Freedom</h1>

<p>The Greek regulator has adopted new rules introducing Router Freedom 
in the country. Since 2021, the FSFE has been working with policymakers 
to protect the interests of end-users. Supporting civil society and 
industry organisations backed the FSFE and contributed positively to 
this new law.</p>

<p>Routers and modems are gateways to the Internet. As with any other 
<a 
href="/activities/deviceneutrality/#general-purpose-computer-free-software">digital 
devices</a>, consumers should be able to choose such an important 
piece of equipment. In order to make this right happen, 
telecommunications law in the EU has been passing through complex 
legislative reforms since 2018. The process has been <a 
href="/news/2020/news-20200601-01">slow and marked by 
nuances</a>. <a 
href="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/router-freedom-monitoring-tool_581123">Not 
all EU countries</a> have taken Router Freedom as a priority. 
Greece, on the other hand, has been working on the issue for several 
years and is now among the European countries regulating how 
end-users can  use their own routers and modems to connect to the 
Internet.</p> 

<h2>Two years of engagement and a lot of teamwork</h2>

<p>At the end of 2020, the Greek telecom regulator (Hellenic 
Telecommunications and Post Commission - EETT) started the reform of 
the telecommunications law and launched the process to set new 
standards for Router Freedom. In April 2021, the FSFE <a 
href="/news/2021/news-20210505-01">coordinated an 
alliance</a> with several civil society organisations and industry 
representatives to provide input  to EETT’s public consultation on the 
new regulation.  At that time, we backed the regulator’s preliminary 
conclusion that Router Freedom would be fully compatible with Greek 
legislation, and would not cause market restrictions or 
interoperability issues.</p>

<p>In April 2022, EETT published the first draft 
of the regulation. However, in the proposal, the regulator <a 
href="/news/2022/news-20220628-01">excluded 
fiber connections (FTTH)</a>, a decision that has the potential to 
negatively impact end-user rights. The FSFE submitted a 
comprehensive analysis on why Router Freedom should encompass fiber and 
why it is essential to strike a balance between the rights of ISPs and 
those of end-users. FSFE’s arguments were supported by the same 
alliance of organisations and group of volunteers. </p> 

<p>In March 2023, EETT adopted the final version of the 
regulation (<a 
href="https://www.eett.gr/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AP1058-011-020.pdf">EL</a>) 
regulating Router Freedom in the country. The new rule confirms the 
freedom of terminal equipment for all network topologies other than 
fiber. The regulator has taken a stricter approach for FTTH and decided 
to keep the optical network equipment (ONT) within the domain of the 
ISPs. Although the regulator allows end-users to require a separation 
of the ONT and routers, this restricts users from plugging their fiber router 
directly into the network.</p>


<h2>The future: room for improvement and pushing against violations</h2>
<p>We acknowledge the efforts the Greek regulator has put over the last few 
years in the regulatory process. The national regulatory agency has involved different 
stakeholders and communicated well with them. These are good practices 
for a transparent and inclusive process for norm setting.</p> 

<p>We regret, however, that EETT has decided to exclude fiber networks  as a default 
for Router Freedom. Although the regulator allows end-users to separate 
the router from the ONT, other European countries, such as <a 
href="/news/2021/news-20210629-01">Finland</a>,
<a href="/news/2021/news-20210805-01">the Netherlands</a>, 
and most probably <a href="/news/2022/news-20221215-01">Belgium</a>, have set higher standards by 
allowing consumers to plug the fiber router directly to the public 
network.</p>

      alt="Picture with types of soft and hard violations by ISPs." />
      <figcaption>Even with Router Freedom established in the legislation, ISPs can still violate the rules.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Notwithstanding this compromise, Greek consumers are better 
served by a clear framework for Router Freedom. Legal uncertainty plays 
against consumers, who now have clear rules to demand their rights from 
ISPs. </p>

<p>We encourage the regulator to make the new rules effective.  More 
than only a technical issue, freedom of terminal equipment represents a 
policy demand and requires constant monitoring of ISPs’ commercial 
practices. Even in countries with clear-cut rules, ISPs can still 
violate them, especially when:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Customers are contractually prohibited from using their equipment or 
ISPs impose disproportional disadvantages upon users with private routers;
</li>
<li>
ISPs do not inform customers of their rights regarding terminal 
equipment or manipulate users through their customer service in favour 
of the ISP’s routers;
</li>
<li>
ISPs advertise their routers as the only ones compatible with the 
network, or use non-standard plugs or proprietary protocols;
</li>
<li>ISPs do not provide users the login data to the public network or make no support available to customers. </li>
<li>
ISPs do not offer the same level of service (e.g. IPv6, bandwidth, etc) 
for customers using their own router.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Router Freedom and Device Neutrality</h2>

<p><a href="/activities/routers/routers">Router Freedom</a> is the 
right of consumers of any Internet Service Provider to choose 
and use 
a private modem and router instead of equipment provided by the ISP. 
<a href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index">Device Neutrality</a> 
protects end-users against discriminatory 
restrictions on Free Software on their devices. With Router Freedom, 
end-users can install a customized operating system on their equipment 
and exercise control over the technology. <a href="/donate">Please consider becoming a 
FSFE donor</a>; you will help make possible our long-term commitment and 
professional dedication to defending people’s rights to control 
technology.</p>
