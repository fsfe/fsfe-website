    <h1>New web design launched!</h1>

    <p newsteaser="yes">After months of work by FSFE's Web Team a new 
    website design has been launched, bringing with it a fresh look, improved 
    infrastructure, and new features.</p>
    
    <p>The process began more than a year ago, and several meetings,
    including a Web Sprint in Berlin last October, were necessary to produce
    the current version.</p>
    
    <h2>New design</h2>
    
    <p>The new design aims to be attractive as well as easier to navigate and 
    read. It is solidly based on FSFE's existing graphical
    profile - colour schemes, fonts, and layout have been carefully chosen
    to extend and build upon FSFE's logo, existing website design, and
    corporate branding. Every thematic element is based on styles which
    already exist within FSFE's media.</p>
