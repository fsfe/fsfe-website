    <h1>Donations to the FSFE</h1>
   
    <p id="introduction">
      The Free Software Foundation Europe is a non-profit
      non-governmental organisation. Our work is made possible by a
      community of <a href="/contribute/">volunteers</a> and <a
        href="/donate/thankgnus.html">donors</a>. Your donations are
      critical to our strength and autonomy — they enable us to continue
      fighting for Free Software wherever necessary, and to be an
      independent voice.
