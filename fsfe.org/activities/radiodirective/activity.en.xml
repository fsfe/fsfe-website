    <title>Radio Lockdown Directive</title>
    <description>
      An EU regulation may make it impossible to install a custom piece of 
      software on most radio devices like WiFi routers, smartphones, and 
      embedded devices. It requires hardware manufacturers to implement a 
      barrier that disallows users to install any software which has not been 
      certified by them.
