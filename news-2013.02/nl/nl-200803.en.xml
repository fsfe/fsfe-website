      It has been another busy month for software freedom.  Open Standards have
      continued to dominate discussions in ICT with the MS-OOXML proposal being
      accepted by ISO as a standard.  FSFE and numerous other parties have observed
      this process from the beginning and have reason to be concerned about the state
      of international standardisation.  You could read more about this in our
      lead story below.
