      <p>We often underestimate the power of a simple "Thank You". Everyone who contributes to or supports Free Software, does valuable work for our society and deserves recognition. The "I Love Free Software" - Day on February 14th offers an opportunity to show your gratitude with a heartfelt: "Thank you for being part of the Free Software community!" On the "I Love Free Software" - Day, we dedicate the day to acknowledge and honor all this voluntary work by saying "Thank you ♥" to the people behind Free Software projects and those who advocate for them. With a simple thank you, we show on February 14th, that we appreciate the efforts of those involved in Free Software. </p>
     <p>Free Software is not just any kind of software: it represents a community. Free Software empowers us to use, understand, share, and improve the software. Let’s build a community for Free Software together — a community that values and welcomes each other — by celebrating the software that empowers us. That is why you’re invited to join our event the “I ♥ Free Software Day - Carinthia”. We’ll host a small installation party featuring F-Droid, Linux, and more, we express our thanks to maintainers, and enjoy good coffee and cake together. It’s the perfect setting to chat about Free Software topics and also to install some! :)</p>
