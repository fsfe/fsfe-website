  <h1>German administration is re@di for the use of Free Software</h1>

  <p>
    A network of nine cities in Germany shows the benefits of ‚Public 
    Money? Public Code!‘
  </p>

  <p>
    2020, in the midst of the corona pandemic, the city of Bühl 
    launched a video conferencing platform called "Palim! Palim!", 
    which is based on the Free Software "Jitsi Meet". Based on the need 
    of the municipal music school to be able to continue to offer group 
    lessons in times of pandemic, the city offered the platform.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the meantime, many clubs, citizens and the city itself use the 
    platform on a daily basis. Other municipalities have also shown 
    interest in the solution. In recent months, a association of nine 
    administrations that use 'Palim! Palim!' and many other Free 
    Software applications, have jointly modernised the administration, 
    based on Free Software. Under the name re@di - regional.digital, 
    the inter-communal cooperation of the South German cities of 
    Baden-Baden, Bretten, Bruchsal, Bühl, Ettlingen, Gaggenau, Rastatt, 
    Rheinstetten and Stutensee is organised.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Through this cooperation, common standards and interfaces are 
    realised. Thus, the wheel does not have to be reinvented over and 
    over again; the common need is met through synergy effects in 
    development but also the continuous exchange of experience and 
    information. They report that they can use their resources more 
    effectively and cost-efficient. Traditional administrative topics 
    such as the electronic administrative file or building applications 
    are dealt with in various project groups of re@di.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, citizen services are also made available and an engagement 
    platform is developed to support voluntary engagement and 
    associations. In the interview with Alexander and Edaurd, you can 
    learn more about the first steps and the daily work on re@di and 
    what advantages it brings for the administrations but also for the 
    citizens.
