          Android is a <a
          href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html"
          title="Android and Users' Freedom">mostly free</a> operating system
          mainly developed by Google. Unfortunately, the drivers for most
          devices and most applications from the "market" are not <a
          href="/about/basics/freesoftware.html" title="What is Free
          Software?">free as in freedom</a>. They frequently work against the
          interest of the users, spy on them and sometimes can not even be
          removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This campaign can help you to <strong>regain control</strong>
          of your Android device and your data. It collects information about
          running an Android system as free as possible and tries to coordinate
          the efforts in this area.

      <p>
        If you want to stay informed or like to work with others on a free
        Android system, you can <strong><a
        href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/android">subscribe to the
        mailing-list</a></strong>. You can also ask questions or give input by
        writing to <a
        href="mailto:android&#64;lists.fsfe.org">android&#64;lists.fsfe.org</a>.
        For technical questions about apps, the <a
        href="irc://irc.freenode.net/fdroid">F-Droid IRC channel</a> is a good
        place to ask. For exchange about the lower layers of Android, the <a
        href="irc://irc.freenode.net/cyanogenmod">CyanogenMod IRC channel</a> is
        more suitable. Everybody in this community is very friendly and loves
        others to help, so don't be shy and get involved!
      </p>

      <h2>Other Related Initiatives</h2>

      <p>
        Even though this campaign is about Android, there are other important
        initiatives that also have the goal to allow you using small mobile
        computers in freedom. There is the spiritual Openmoko continuation <a
        href="http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-main/">GTA04 from Golden
        Delicious</a>. It builds a free phone without the need for proprietary
        drivers. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maemo">Maemo</a>/<a
        href="https://meego.com/">MeeGo</a> initiative has now moved into <a
        href="http://merproject.org/">Mer</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen">Tizen</a> and tries to be an
        alternative free operating system. Also WebOS is <a
        href="http://developer.palm.com/blog/2011/12/open-source/">about to be
        liberated</a>.
