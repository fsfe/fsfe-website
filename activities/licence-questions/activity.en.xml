    <description>
      The FSFEâ€™s License Questions mailing list is our group of
      volunteers dedicated to provide help with Free Software licenses
      and compliance. If you need advice on what Free Software licence
      you should use, or if you want to know more about what rights you
      have over a piece of Free Software, you can contact us.
