<h1>#ilovefs Report 2015</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">On Saturday, the 14 February, people all over the world
showed Free Software contributors their appreciation. It was the fifth year the
Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) asked people to participate at the “I
Love Free Software”-Day. This report shows a variety of different love
declarations that happened this day in blog posts, pictures, comics, a poem,
and a #ilovefs Android library. The FSFE thanks everybody who motivated Free
Software contributors.  For everybody who was not able to participate this
year, mark 14 February 2015 in your calendar for next year's “I love Free
Software”-Day.</p>

FSFE's president Karsten Gerloff described as</a> -- “powerful tools that help
us defend and regain the freedoms we’ve lost, and the ones we’ve given up”: as
Our sister organisation encouraged people to ask someone they like --
romantically or otherwise -- <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/will-you-be-my-cryptovalentine">to be
their “cryptovalentine”</a>. Besides like <a

Ockers</a>, <a
