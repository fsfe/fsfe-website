      <p>Dario Presutti presents the latest development regarding router freedom in Italy. In particular, I will highlight FSFE’s latest contribution to the consultation opened by Italy’s telecommunications regulator, AGCOM, regarding freedom of terminal equipment in fiber networks.</p>
     <p>Italy is one of the European Countries granting router freedom to users. However, exceptions to this freedom in fiber networks proposed by telecom operators and confirmed by AGCOM in 2019 undermine users’ freedom to choose their terminal equipment.<br />
In February 2025, AGCOM initiated a regulatory process to determine whether consumers can choose and use their own routers/modems in fiber networks (FTTx). The talk will indeed present FSFE’s argument presented in the contribution to AGCOM, highlighting why there is no technological necessity to limit the freedom of terminal equipment in fiber networks.</p>
     <p>This talk will also shed light on the Next Generation Internet project as a funding initiative for shaping the future of the internet with Free Software. The audience will learn about the funding opportunities and how Router Freedom has been dealt with by regulators in other countries as well.<br />
