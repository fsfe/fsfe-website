    <title>RSS feeds of news and event announcements available</title>
    <body>
      <p>
      Our web team has created automatic RSS feeds for news and upcoming
      events. Feeds are focus and language dependent.<br/>

      The URL for the news feed is
      https://fsfe.org/news/news.<i>language</i>.rss,
      while you find the event feed at
      https://fsfe.org/events/events.<i>language</i>.rss.
      For example, for German speaking news and the German focus, you would
      choose https://fsfe.org/news/news.de.rss.<br/>

      For your convenience, the news and event pages contain links to the RSS
      feed URLs.
