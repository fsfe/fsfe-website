    <p><strong>
     		  International development cooperation is increasingly digitised. Free Software thus is becoming an indispensable fundamental technology that guarantees legally compliant international cooperation and reuse, a technology that enables global scaling with simultaneous local adaptability. In order to tap the full potential of digital development cooperation, the FSFE demands that all software development (co-)financed by taxpayers' money be published as Free Software.

    <h3 id="about-development-cooperation">About international development cooperation</h3>

    <p>
	
		International development cooperation is concerned with the sustainable improvement of global economic, social, ecological and political conditions. International development cooperation strives for the UN sustainability goals and the empowerment of partners: Existing dependencies of development recipients should be reduced and new dependencies avoided at all costs.
	</p>

			</figure>
     
     
     <p>Any independence resulting in turn requires the support of existing or the establishment of new local structures on site. Central problems should be solved or be made solvable locally, and prosperity should be made accessible and distributed appropriately. Many development policy initiatives and actors therefore rely heavily on working together with various local partner organizations, supporting them and, if necessary, integrating them into appropriate development programs.
    </p>

	<h3 id="digital-resources">Digital resources und dependencies</h3>
	
    <p>
		The focus of international development cooperation is increasingly shifting to the level of digital cooperation. Whether in agriculture, industrial production, health care or public administration, the development and maintenance of modern social processes is no longer conceivable without software. In this context, the global digital divide is almost identical to the global analog divide in social and political inequality. Traditional donor and recipient constellations remain almost unchanged, but development cooperation is shifting more and more into the digital realm. 
    </p>

			</figure>
	
    
    <p>
		As with analog development cooperation, digital development policy solutions can only have a lasting effect if existing dependencies are reduced and new dependencies are avoided at all costs. Current dependencies and central problems of the recipient countries arise from the following factors in particular: access restrictions to digital resources, lack of technical expertise, lack of translations and missing modification possibilities, the unequal distribution of digital products and hardware and the resulting global digital differences in power and ownership. At the same time, these are precisely the problems that can only be sustainably solved and taken into account locally and with the involvement of local civil society. And it is precisely these aspects in which Free Software excels over proprietary software and makes the decisive difference.
    </p>

    <h3 id="problem-proprietary-software">Problem: proprietary software </h3>

    <p>
		Most of these digital dependencies and problems are a by-product of the use of proprietary software. With proprietary software all rights of reuse and further development as well as modifications are reserved to the manufacturers. The roll-out of proprietary software strengthens thereby unconsciously or also deliberately the dependencies of users in the developing countries to the currently market-dominating software industry from the present industrial countries. From a development policy perspective and from a sustainability perspective, however, access to hardware, software and empowering knowledge should be as open as possible for everyone. The use of Free Software offers exactly this basis for such an open access approach for anyone in software. In this article the basics and advantages of the use of Free Software in development cooperation will be examined in detail.
    </p>

	<h3 id="solution-free-software">Solution: Free Software as a fundament of development cooperation</h3>

	<p>
		 eGovernance, eHealth, digital agriculture and other digital services of international development cooperation are based on the use of software. Functional software thus becomes the basic technology of social organization as well as of modern administrative services. Free Software allows once made development investments to be reused around the globe without (further) license costs and without legal or technical restrictions. The simultaneous publication of its source code on public code repositories also enables one's own software development to profit from reusing, improving and republishing by other actors around the globe - the so-called "upstream"<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a>. In terms of international cooperation, the freely licensed source code serves as a basis for organized or self-empowered knowledge multiplication and transfer as well as international cooperation. Free Software allows the development of digital cornerstoes and provides international standards without creating new monopolies and dependencies. In the same way, one's own software development can benefit from existing publications of other Free Software. Instead of constantly reinventing the wheel, Free Software allows all people to "stand on the shoulders of giants" at the same time.

	<h3 id="status-quo">Status quo Free Software and international development cooperation</h3>
	
		<p>
			
			In 2014, the <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/principles/">"Principles for Digital Development"</a> were developed by the Digital Impact Alliance, who belong to the United Nations Foundation. One of the nine principles requires the publication of software, data and standards under free licenses (<a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/use-open-standards-open-data-open-source-and-open-innovation/">#6</a>: <em>"Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation"</em>). The use of free licenses also has a positive effect on most of the other principles, including
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Adaptability to local conditions; (<a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/design-with-the-user/">#1</a>: <em>„Design With the User“</em>)</li>
			<li>Scaling across regional borders; (<a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/design-for-scale/">#3</a>: <em>„Design for Scale“</em>)</li>
			<li>Sustainable maintenance and further development; (<a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/build-for-sustainability/">#4</a>: <em>„Build for Sustainability“</em>)</li>
			<li>Reuse and improvement of digital resources; (<a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/reuse-and-improve/">#7</a>: <em>„Reuse and Improve“</em>)</li>
			<li>Data protection; (<a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/address-privacy-security/">#8</a>: <em>„Address Privacy &amp; Security“</em>)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			
			The obvious interaction between the principles mentioned above and the underlying development goals, as well as the reusability of existing digital solutions, show that Free Software is an essential part of any sustainable digital development. Consequently, the UNICEF Innovation Fund for example, invests exclusively only in technologies that are Free Software <a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a>. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			
			Numerous implementing organizations and givers in development cooperation, IT service providers and international organizations have since signed the <em>"Principles for Digital Development Cooperation"</em>. Other initiatives are orienting themselves towards or referring to these guidelines, for example the <a href="https://www.ictworks.org/principles-donors-digital-health/">"Principles of Donor Alignment for Digital Health"</a>. The signatories of both documents thus demand to benefit from the advantages of Free Software in international development cooperation.
		</p>

		<p>
		
		However, despite all the positive developments in recent years, many national and international development cooperation organizations still rely on the development of proprietary software. Thus, they not only miss out on the advantages of using Free Software. As organizations financed primarily with public funds, they also contradict the demand for linking public funds to Public Software<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a>. This is often done out of ignorance or the reproduction of existing procurement practices. In order to change these dynamics for the better, the FSFE is calling for all taxpayer-funded software development to be (co-)financed as Free Software and highlights on this page the advantages of using and developing Free Software in international development cooperation. 
		</p>
	
	<blockquote>

	<h2 id="pmpc-for-development-cooperation">(II) FSFE demands: Public code for publicly financed international development cooperation</h2>
	
	
		<p>
			
			Many European actors and initiatives in international development cooperation are supported or completely financed by public funds - via the European Union or its member states. According to the <a href="https://publiccode.eu">"Public Money? Public Code! campaign</a>, the FSFE demands that in all international development cooperation, (co-)financed software development is published as Free Software. This includes both internal workflows and software developed by and for local partners. Only this way can we unlock the full potential and the <a href="#positive-devlopment-by-using-free software">positive developmental impact that the use and development of Free Software</a> includes. Especially in the international development cooperation we acknowledge that code paid by the people should be available to the people!

			<h3 id="sustainable-handover">Sustainable handover</h3>
			
			<p>The release of software under a Free License <a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a> enables a sustainable business and development model even after a solution has been handed over to the partner organizations, and offers unlocking the full potential of the digital resource: Since there are no license costs, no licensing restrictions or dependencies, Free Software can be reused and scaled without limitations - locally and globally. </p>

          <div>	
			<h3 id="independence-ownership">Independence and ownership</h3>
			
			<p>Via its license, Free Software offers the unrestricted possibility to further develop existing code and thus to adapt software. These adaptations can be done by users themselves or as a service undertaken by third parties. This allows, for example, local service providers to take over further development, maintenance and support of the software without restrictions. Free software allows maximum independence for service providers, service recipients, and partner organizations and can thus serve to build local IT expertise.</p>

		<h3 id="local-economy">Growing local economy</h3>
		
			<p>Free Software offers legally safe possibilities for further development of existing code and modifications of software. In particular, the unrestricted possibilities of further development and localization by third parties enable the creation, use and development of digital resources on site. If local players are commissioned for further development or localisation of an existing software, this leads directly to the strengthening of the local economic power and the installation of local competence. Under certain circumstances, the expertise gained in this way can even be exported as a service<a class="fn" href="#fn7">7</a>. </p>

          <div>	
			
		<h3 id="cost-transparency">Cost control and transparency</h3>
			
			<p>In absence of usage restrictions and license fees, a successful Free Software solution can be copied or implemented without limitation. This can benefit the limited budgets in developing countries<a class="fn" href="#fn8">8</a>. In particular, there is no danger of hidden costs as with proprietary solutions that are offered at a low price in the outset but could impose high follow-up costs or other uncontrollable price structures after its implementation and the resulting dependencies.

          <div>
		<h3 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h3>
			
			<p>The freedom to improve and reuse Free Software also enables international development cooperation actors on the donor side to achieve maximum flexibility and scaling of any self-developed IT solution without additional license costs<a class="fn" href="#fn9">9,</a> <a class="fn" href="#fn10">10</a>: Good solutions from one place can be reused at another.</p>

          <div>	

		<h3 id="local-translations">Localisations and translations</h3>
		
			<p>In addition to software modifications, Free Software enables the independent and unlimited translation of existing software and documentation into any local language and adapting to cultural conditions. Such a localization can help to overcome part of the "digital divide" between English and non-English speakers<a class="fn" href="#fn11">11</a>. Additional local modifications of the software to better fit into cultural conditions enable the inclusion of local companies and ultimately increase the adoption and acceptance of an IT solution by its local users.</p>

          <div>
		<h3 id="local-acceptance">Local adoption</h3>
			
			<p>In addition to the source code and the language, all other content can be adapted to local conditions if the publication under free license is used consistently; for example, currency and measurement units or the visual language in use. Adapting software to cultural conditions can further help to promote understanding and local acceptance. In the same way, the software itself can be adapted for different local purposes, for example to specific business processes or different legal requirements.</p>

		<h3 id="local-partnerships">Local partnerships</h3>
		
			<p>Local partners can be involved already during early conception stages or in designing local modifications and implementations - as well as later in the translation, training or delivery of the software <a class="fn" href="#fn12">12</a>. These local partnerships can be very helpful in incrementally introducing technologies, promoting adoption and facilitating the learning curve <a class="fn" href="#fn13">13</a>. Ideally, a local market for the purchase of technical expertise is gets formed and starts growing.

		<h3 id="competition">Competition</h3>
		
			<p>Since Free Software may be modified for any purpose, this also applies to commercial use. Free Software promotes local and international competition by allowing existing solutions to be reused or to build services around existing solutions that can be offered locally without having to pay a "producer" any usage fee <a class="fn" href="#fn14">14</a>. It also prevents the creation of a monopoly.</p>
