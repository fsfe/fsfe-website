    <title>FSFE summit 2016 - September 2nd to 4th, BCC Berlin, Germany</title>
  </head>
  <body>


  <h1>Attendance, registration and donations</h1>


  <p>The FSFE summit is organised as a subconference of the QtCon2016, that brings together the events and communities of Qt Contributors, VideoLAN, KDAB, KDE and FSFE. From the organisational side, these joint efforts come with a lot of synergy effects. Participants have the benefit to join five conferences at the same time. </p>

  <p>To represent such a cross-community and cross-border Free Software meeting, and with the help of Qt and KDAB we have decided to host our conferences in the Berlin Congress Center (BCC). This is a representative building in the heart of Berlin. Although far from being a low-cost venue, it comes with the size to cover such a huge gathering of different communities. Also, it comes with a full catering and service that helps everyone involved as well as the participants to concentrate on topics, meetings and networking. </p>

  <p id="nutshell">In a nutshell, attendance at the FSFE summit includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Entrance to the FSFE summit and all internal workshops and sessions</li>
      <li>Entrance to all public sessions of the other subconferences from Qt Contributors, VideoLAN, KDAB and KDE</li>
      <li>Entrance to the "15 years FSFE" years social meetup and party on Saturday night</li>
      <li>Full catering during the conference days (Light breakfast, lunch, coffee break and refreshments during the day)</li>
      <li>Dinner and afterparty on Friday evening</li>
      <li>A service environment that helps you to concentrate on your topics and meetings</li>
    </ul>


  <p>Be aware that, although the BCC is a huge location, the space is physically limited. To offer a peaceful and secure environment, we need to <a href="#registration">run a registration process</a> to guarantee we do not get overloaded.</p>


  <h3 id="donation">Your donation for attendance</h3>

  <p>Such a big event, including catering for the participants, costs us organisers a lot of money. So far we could not match our investments with refunds by sponsors. That is why we propose to participants a donation to help us cover our costs.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, we are aware that financial resources are different among our community members and that financial costs might limit participation. However, it is important for us to not exclude anyone from our community just because of the costs. We therefore decided to offer a flexible donation as an entrance fee for our community members. That means, no one is forced to pay entrance fee. During the registration process you can slide your voluntary donation up or down to any amount you like (including zero). But please keep in mind that there is three days of catering included. Means, if you participate in the FSFE summit you most probably save more than 50 Euro by not having to buy food for three days in the center of Berlin.</p>

  <p>Here you can find some help and orientation for your donation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>150 Euro: Choose around one hundred and fifty Euro to fully cover our costs and to enable us to run another summit in the future. This is the proposed amount of the organisers and the default in your registration process. Your donation is highly appreciated.</li>
      <li>100 Euro: Choose around one hundred Euro if you are a member of the FSFE community and you like us to help covering our costs. With this amount you also help us to run another summit in the future.</li>
      <li>50 Euro: Choose around fifty Euro if you are an active member of the FSFE community, you cannot afford to pay entrance fee but you like us to at least cover the catering costs. Realistically, you save around the same amount by not having to pay food, coffee, lunch and drinks for three days in the center of Berlin. Fifty Euro therefore can be seen as a simple way to give back the costs you save by attending the conference.</li>
      <li>0 Euro: Choose zero Euro if you are an active member of the FSFE community and you cannot afford to pay any entrance fee. Please, still feel welcome!</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Unfortunately, this donation is not tax-deductable.</p>

  <p>In the next step, be aware that the 150 Euro that you see on the top right corner are a proposed donation to cover our costs. However, you can slide up or down your financial support. Yes, you can also go down to zero, as stated on the very same page and highlighted in blue in the screenshot. Read the <a href="">Your donation for attendance</a> section for more details. </p>

  <p>An example of a changed donation slider. Althoug it is possible to slide down to zero, (see <a href="">Your donation for attendance</a> section), fifty Euro is our recommended minimum choice of donation, as this is the money you are supposed to save by not having to buy food for three days.</p>
