   <title>Talk about F-Droid by Daniel Martí in Barcelona, Spain</title>

   <body>
     <p>It is well known that Android is an Open Source Operating System. But in practice, in order to use it a lot of non-free and locked down platforms are needed, like Google Play. F-Droid aims to fill this gap by offering a free platform that you can use to install and distribute your applications. The session will be provided by Daniel Martí, a lead F-Droid developer.
