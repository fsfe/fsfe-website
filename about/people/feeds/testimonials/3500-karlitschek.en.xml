      Software is running the world. All aspects of our life are controlled and
      steered by software which is running on local devices or somewhere
      remote, in the cloud. If we want to have an open and democratic society
      then it is key to have full transparency how this software works. This
      includes the rights to study it, to change it, to distribute it and run
      it wherever we want. Free Software is the only concept which ensures
      these rights. Iâ€™m a happy supporter of the Free Software Foundation
      Europe because the FSFE promotes these values which are so important for
      our future.
