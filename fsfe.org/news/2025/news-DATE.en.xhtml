    <h1>“They're not alone in their fight for software freedom“</h1>
    
    <p>
      Every year on 14. of February we celebrate “I Love Free Software Day”, 
      thanking all who contribute to Free Software. Without all of you we 
      wouldn’t have such a great ecosystem today! Our Polish group joined 
      our celebrations on 2025 for the first time and we wanted to know more 
      about them. Check out what Damian, our Poland group coordinator told us.

      Since 2018 the Polish country team of the FSFE, the FSFE Poland is 
      around. For some time there was a dull in the activities of the groups 
      – but now they are back! Currently there are three local groups, 
      Warsaw, Poznań and Wrocław supporting software freedom in Poland. 
      Together they get up to quite a lot and are actively organising events 
      and campaigns. For a good impression of their activity you can of 
      course join their <a href="https://chat.fsfe.org/#/room/%23fsfe-pl:fsfe.org">
      Matrix room</a> (PL only).
      <br /> <br />
      Together they also decided to celebrate the I Love Free Software Day 
      2025. Taking this as the perfect opportunity to restart FSFE Poland. 
      They organised three events to which everyone interested in Free 
      Software was invited. Representatively, every event was visited by 
      20-30 people, there was lots of fun, interesting conversations with 
      a focus on lesser known software, and lots of pizza!

        <strong>FSFE</strong>: Hello Damian, we are glad that you could 
        take the time for this interview. Can you tell us how many local 
        groups there are in Poland? Can everybody who is interested join them?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian, coordinator of FSFE Poland</strong>: The Polish 
        volunteers happen to be mostly from around Warsaw, Poznań and Wrocław 
        so I'd say there are three groups overall. Of course anyone can join, 
        as these are not strict groups at all . If your goals align with ours 
        and Free Software is important for you, we invite you to participate 
        in our Matrix rooms, especially if you'd be willing to help with our 
        projects and activities.

    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: What did you do at the I Love Free software Day 
        2025?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: This was our first time; we plan to celebrate 
        the event each year in a more coordinated manner! For 2025, we managed 
        to make a unified template for all our local activities and helped each 
        other organise the event and in three cities: Wrocław, Poznań and 
        Warsaw. The result were meetings of about 20-30+ people in each location. 
        We talked about Free Software with emphasis on on those that are hidden, 
        lesser-known projects, but important for us for some specific reason.

    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: Was there something you liked very much about 
        the celebrations?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: I feel like it helped us unify our 
        "frontlines" a little bit. People got to acknowledge that FSFE 
        supports their work and – hopefully – that they're not alone in their 
        fight for software freedom. I liked that we made a common template for 
        the event and that we translated pre-talks to polish - huge kudos to 
        Wiktor Przybylski, Paweł Wiczyński, Kacper from Hackerspace Łódź and 
        others for their excellent work.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: Why do you think I Love Free Software Day is 
        important and why should everybody be celebrating this day?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: Because it raises awareness in the community 
        about the importance of free software. It also shows the importance of 
        work done by volunteers who help with the development of free 
        software. "I Love Free Software Day" is one of the few opportunities 
        to meet in person, where free software is the leading conversation topic.

    </figure>
    
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: What are the activities the local groups do 
        and is there something happening where new people are welcome to join 
        and support the effort?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: ou could say that each FSFE group is loosely 
        associated around a hackerspace, which provided place to host the 
        events in the three distinct cities this year. People feeling 
        associated with the Free Software movement just naturally gravitate 
        towards these places. We are using matrix channels as the sole medium 
        of communication and everyone interested in Free Software is encouraged 
        to join. I'd say our main activities are promoting the Free Software 
        movement by organizing Free Software events in Poland: <strong>"Sesja 
        Linuksowa" ("Linux Session"), "Poznańska Impreza Wolnego Oprogramowania" 
        ("Poznań Free Software Party"), "Jesień Linuxowa" ("Linux Autumn")
        </strong> etc.
        <br />
        The FSFE volunteers are, in varying proportions, organisers of these 
        events and I think it's now impossible to find a Free Software event 
        without one of us being there. We're timidly trying to get more 
        seriously into translations and have started writing reports regarding 
        Free Software that I hope will appear by the end of the year.

    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: As last year, in 2025, you celebrated 
        "I Love Free Software Day" for first time, what motivated you to 
        participate?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: Actually, the first “I Love Free Software 
        Day” event I organised was in 2017 at Poznań University of Technology. 
        I was a student and Free Software student's club president so it felt 
        pretty natural at that time. I've already helped organising "Poznańska 
        Impreza Wolnego Oprogramowania" ("Poznań Free Software Party") and 
        Linux Presentation Days before. In 2016 I saw some FSFE stickers on 
        someone's laptop and the person suggested that we could order stickers 
        off FSFE website for our conference next time. I wanted to be part of 
        the celebration because I loved the idea the first time and the timing 
        for the event is ideal for a Free Software event because nothing much 
        happens during the winter time.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: As a coordinator of the Poland group, you 
        managed the communication for all three local groups. How was this 
        from your perspective as coordinator and are there some pitfalls you 
        can share with us that other country coordinators should watch out for?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: I think I had huge advantage already because 
        I personally know people from the other cities. I've studied in Poznań 
        and the organisers are ex-members of the Free Software student's club. 
        Their friends and I met Michał from Wrocław during “"Jesień Linuxowa".
        Him being one of the main organisers behind “Sesja Linuxowa” made him 
        an ideal candidate to organise a way smaller event like "I Love Free 
        Software Day". In reality I didn't have to coordinate much as I had 
        very experienced organisers at hand that I could rely on. If I were 
        to give a piece of advice to people coordinating things on country 
        level scale, it is that you need to find people with initiative and 
        a sense of responsibility to cooperate with. In any kind of 
        relationship, input from both sides is required. I don't think it 
        would really work in other communities if I tried to force my way 
        onto people that don't feel comfortable in such a role.

     <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>FSFE</strong>: Do you already have plans for celebrating 
        “I Love Free Software Day 2026”?
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Damian</strong>: There is a LAN party culture that we 
        inherited from previous organisers of “Poznańska Impreza Wolnego 
        Oprogramowania” that I really cherish. I think it would be nice if 
        the "I Love Free Software Day" had some LAN-Party-like online events 
        alongside (like these informal communities organise: https://onfoss.org 
        and https://fossgralnia.pl). There we could promote and raise 
        awareness about this kind of software. Besides, I don't know if the 
        theme is already announced but I hope everyone's aiming to affect more 
        people, listen to more talks and eat more pizza.

        <strong>FSFE</strong>: That sounds like a great party! We cannot wait
