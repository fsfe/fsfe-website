<h1>What pupils write about proprietary software and why it motivates me</h1>

<p>Pupils all over the world are learning about the story of "Ada &amp; 
Zangemann - A Tale of Software, Skateboards and Raspberry Ice Cream": it 
is encouraging to see how new generations are inspired to start coding, 
and to write to Zangemann about his behaviour. Below a message from our 
president Matthias Kirschner to our readers. </p>

<p>2023 has been a busy year at the FSFE. Besides our general promotion 
for software freedom, we have helped EU regulators to better understand 
Free Software for their work on the Cyber Resilience Act, the Product 
Liability, the Interoperable Europe and the AI Act. We have followed up 
on the Digital Markets Act about device neutrality, monitored the 
implementation of router freedom, and made sure to keep public 
administration accountable for their promises on Public Money? Public 
Code!". We supported Free Software contributors by answering questions 
and providing tools to better handle legal obligations.</p>

<p>This year, as well as in the two decades before, there are times 
when, despite working hard with our team, there are setbacks. 
Regulators who (even though it is 2023!) still do not understand how 
Free Software works, companies that, again and again, try to restrict 
software freedom for their own benefit despite the harm they thereby do 
to society, or people in the Free Software community who fight with 
each other instead of focusing on our common mission.</p> 

<p>Looking ahead, next year marks 20 years of working for the Free 
Software Foundation Europe for me. On 10 December 2003 I joined the 
FSFEâ€™s discussion mailing lists; in 2004, I became the FSFE's first 
intern; later, I continued as a volunteer; and since 2009, I am a staff 
member.</p> 

<p>At the FSFE, I have the privilege of working with many volunteers 
and colleagues who encourage each other to continue our work, even in 
situations where others might have given up. We remind each other why 
we are doing this work, and why it is crucial for society to continue 
it despite hard resistance.</p> 

<p>Some of those reminding moments are when I get emails and letters 
about the book "Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and 
Raspberry Ice Cream": emails from parents telling me about their 
daughter who started programming after reading the book to her; cute 
postcards from children telling me their thoughts about the book; or an 
email with pictures from a hospital in the Middle East who got some of 
the books and shared with us how much the children enjoyed reading the 
book (and side note, as one character in the book, many of them have 3D 
printed arms or legs due to war injuries).</p>

<p>In June, we received the letters that pupils wrote from the English 
International College in Marbella (Spain). Their teacher, Kaye Fogarty 
read the book together with her 8- and 9-year-old pupils, focusing on 
"the access to the internet on a global level and how the inequality of 
access in certain parts of the world hugely disadvantages people there 
in terms of education and opportunity". The pupils then shared their 
thoughts on the book by <a 
href="https:/activities/ada-zangemann/letters.html">writing letters to 
Zangemann</a>, the antagonist of the 
book. We got permission to share those letters with you -- so you can 
see for yourself why that was a motivating moment for me.</p> 

<p>Reading all these letters and emails, I am sure that there are many 
young people out there who care about software freedom. While people in 
our movement have been working hard for software freedom for 40 years 
now, I am confident that there will be new generations, bright and 
energetic who will take the reins and using technology to shape their 
future. I have a strong feeling that they will continue with, and 
strengthen, our movement for the challenges that lie ahead for humanity 
in the next 40 years.</p>
