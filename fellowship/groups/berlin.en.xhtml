      <p>About:<br/>
      <p>The Fellowship group in Berlin is a group of people that love Free Software and the idea of bringing people together that care about Software freedom as well as civil digital rights. We are not just hackers but political activists, not just online acitivists but also offline activists. Our meetings usually have an Agenda along that we discuss most important and recent topics. Sometimes we have a talk, sometimes we do certain acitivities, sometimes we support FSFE's campaigns. No matter if you are interested in joining activities or only like to chat with likeminded people - you are welcome! </p>
