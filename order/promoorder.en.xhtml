		<p>There are various reasons why and when you should receive promotion
 material from the FSFE. Maybe you know a location (e.g. a Hackerspace, a youth club, your office...) where you would love to see advertisement for FSFE. Or you would like to tell your friends and colleagues about FSFE and what we are doing. Or you are even planning a public activity to promote FSFE and our work. These are just some examples for the usage of our promotion material. Please, feel free to decide for yourself when, why and for what you would like to use it. </p>

		<h2 id="id-how-and-what-to-order">How and what to order</h2>

		<p>To order promotion material please use the following order form. You might either 
order our default package or tell us explicitly what kind of promotion

			<a href="http://download.fsfe.org/advocacy/posters/fellowship-xl-en.pdf" title="Join the Fellowship"><img class="left grid-30" src="promotion/joinfellowship-poster_thumb.png" /></a>

			<p class="right grid-70">Our <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/join">"Join the Fellowship"</a> <strong>poster</strong>. A good 
poster to pin on a prominent place, for example inside a meeting room or a Hackerspace
and for use at any public activity. Available in size A1.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="left break margin-vertical">

			<a href="https://fsfe.org/about/printable/folder.en.F.pdf" title="What is FSFE"><img class="left grid-30" src="promotion/folder-fsfe-en1_thumb.png" /></a>

			<p class="right grid-70">Our FSFE <strong>folder</strong>. 
On the inside of these folders, there is written some core information about FSFE, Free Software and how to contribute. They are available in an English and a German version. These folders are made to handle additional paper with more information inside, they are available in size A4 and in size A5. Inside of the latter, we normally put our Fellowship leaflets (see next item), as they are in size A5, too. The others, namely those in size A4, we normally spread with printed versions of our <a href="https://fsfe.org/about/printable/">political leaflets</a>. But they are also very useful in other contexts, for example spreading informations to the attendees of a conference.</p>

			<p class="right grid-70">Our Fellowship <strong>leaflets</strong>. These leaflets are in size A5, so they fit perfectly into our FSFE folder (see item above). It is a nice piece of a graphical artwork, explaining why someone should think about becoming a fellow. The print is double sided: One side is in <a href="http://download.fsfe.org/advocacy/leaflets/fellowship-leaflet-nyr2.1.en.pdf" title="What can I do">English</a>, the other one in <a href="http://download.fsfe.org/advocacy/leaflets/fellowship-leaflet-nyr2.1.de.pdf" title="Was kann ich tun">German</a>. </p>

			<p class="right grid-70">This <strong>flyer</strong> is about Free Software and the GNU project and compares Free Software to the use of screws and screwdrivers. On the last page then, it promotes Richard Stallman and the FSFE and the Fellowship of the FSFE. Attention: This flyer is only available in German right now but is in progress of translation and production for other languages, too.</p>

			<p class="right grid-70">The classic Plussy <strong>stickers</strong>, the symbol of FSFE`s Fellowship. The background is transparent, so the sticker integrates perfectly in any sourrounding - not just on laptops. Size: 7 x 7cm.</p>

		</div>

		

		<div class="left break margin-vertical">

			<a href="http://www.fsfe.org/campaigns/android/artwork/DIN_A7_en_oxl.png" title="Free Your Android"><img class="left grid-30" src="promotion/fya-flyer-en_thumb.png" /></a>

			<p class="right grid-70">This is the <strong>flyer</strong> of our <a href="http://www.freeyourandroid.org/">"Free Your Android" campaign</a>
 for which are posters available, too. They are in size A7, that

			<p class="right grid-70">This is the <strong>poster</strong> of our <a href="http://www.pdfreaders.org/">PDFreaders campaign</a>. The poster is plain, so you have to fill out the <a href="http://fsfe.org/campaigns/pdfreaders/petition.en.html">actual numbers of organisations and individuals signing our petition</a> by yourself. This is long lasting campaign now, still people like it very much. Size A1.</p>

		<p class="right grid-70"> The "I cannot read your documents" <strong>stickers</strong> address our <a href="http://www.documentfreedom.org/">Document Freedom Day campaign</a>. The slogan highlights the problem in the use of proprietary file formats, as they exclude all people not using the same proprietary software from reading the document. Size: 7,5 x 7,5cm.</p>
