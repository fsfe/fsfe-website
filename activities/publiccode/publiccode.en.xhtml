<p>Why is software created using taxpayers' money not released as Free Software? We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly available under a Free and Open Source Software licence. If it is public money, it should be public code as well.</p>

</div>

<p>The <a href="https://publiccode.eu">Public Money? Public Code!</a> campaign aims to set Free Software as the standard for publicly financed software. Public administrations following this principle can benefit from collaboration with other public bodies, independence from single vendors, potential tax savings, increased innovation, and a better basis for IT security.</p>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe together with over 200 civil society organisations and more than 31.000 individuals signed the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">Open Letter</a>. We will use the signatures to contact decision makers and political representatives all over Europe and convince them to make public code the standard. You are invited to <a href="https://publiccode.eu/#action">add your signature</a> to make a bigger impact!</p>

<p>In the framework of this campaing, we are also working on empowering civil society to get active in helping us convince their public administrations. For this, we have created the activity <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/ContactingAdministrationsForPMPC">"Contact your administrations"</a>. In this wiki page, you will find all the necessary information and arguments that you will need when getting in touch with your public administrations. You will also find some example letters in different languages that you can tailor to reach out your political representatives. Furthermore, we are also offering workshops to our community to have a more practical approach to this activity. Stay tuned for more information!</p>
