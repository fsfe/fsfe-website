    <h2 id="italy-at-the-forefront-of-european-legislation-for-public-code">
      Italy at the forefront of European legislation for public code</h2>
    
    <p>With the FSFE&apos;s <a href="https://publiccode.eu">
      Public Money? Public Code!</a> campaign not only do we demand that code
      paid for by the people should be available to the people. We also
      highlight good examples of public code so other decision makers can learn
      from it. One very good example is
      <a href="http://www.agid.gov.it/cad/art-68-analisi-comparativa-soluzioni">
      Article 68</a> and
      <a href="http://www.agid.gov.it/cad/art-69-riuso-soluzioni-standard-aperti">
      Article 69</a> of the &quot;Codice Amministrazione Digitale&quot;, an
      Italian law requiring public administrations inside Italy to prefer
      internally made solutions and Free Software solutions over proprietary
      ones. In addition, these administrations have the duty to share the source
      code and documentation of any software developed with public money.
      These laws put Italy at the forefront of European legislation in favour of
      public code.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, so far the law lacks proper implementation. In that light,
      the FSFE&apos;s country team in Italy ran an
      <a href="/activities/elections/askyourcandidates/askyourcandidates">
      Ask Your Candidates campaign</a> in which they
      <a href="/news/2018/news-20180219-01">asked the political
      parties about their stand on Free Software</a> and the implementation of
      the aforementioned Articles 68 and 69 after the national elections on
      March 4.</p>

    <p>FSFE Italy received very positive replies and many parties
      <a href="/news/2018/news-20180302-01.html">took a
      favourable stand towards Free Software</a>. Such a big consensus across
      these parties gives hope to open up a lot of possibilities for progress
      towards the use of Free Software at the state level in Italy and a better
      implementation of Articles 68 and 69 of the &quot;Codice Amministrazione
      Digitale&quot;. As a match to this, the team &quot;Developers
      Italia&quot;, who are in charge of further implementation of the Articles
      68 and 69,
      <a href="https://twitter.com/developersITA/status/964060999899860992">sent
      out their love for Free Software</a> on I love Free Software day.</p>

    <h2 id="read-our-detailed-ilovefs-report">Read our detailed IloveFS 
      report</h2>

    <p>As promised in the last newsletter, we now have a
      <a href="/news/2018/news-20180308-01">detailed report about our IloveFS
      campaign in 2018</a>. In the report, you will not only read about some
      highlights that happened for this year&apos;s IloveFS. Thanks to our
      current intern Jan, we also have an analysis and visualisation of 439
      &apos;I Love Free Software&apos; messsages containing the
      <em>&#35;IloveFS</em> hashtag. The scraper Jan used for his analysis is
      written in GNU R and <a href="https://git.fsfe.org/janwey/ilfs-data">
      published as Free Software</a>.</p>

    <p>While every year we are happy to see so many people celebrating I
      love Free Software day, we also encourage you to express your Free
      Software love every day :)</p>

	this means for the valuation of the actual work that is done,
	examining Python language development as an example.</li>
      <li>Isabel Drost Fromm
