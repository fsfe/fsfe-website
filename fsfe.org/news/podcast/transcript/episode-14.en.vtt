00:00.000 --> 00:18.120
Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.960
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:21.960 --> 00:25.280
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:25.280 --> 00:29.080
I'm Matthias Kurschner, the president of the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:29.080 --> 00:34.440
And our guest today is Elektra, who works as a software and hardware developer and is

00:34.440 --> 00:39.680
involved in the development of match networking and the Freifung initiative.

00:39.680 --> 00:45.960
She's a philosopher, I think we can say, the author of the book Mesh, a co-author of the

00:45.960 --> 00:52.680
book Wireless Networking in the Developing World, and moderates the Freifung Radio and

00:52.680 --> 01:01.080
Radio Shows of Micro FM at Collaboration Radio on 88fear.de.

01:01.080 --> 01:06.120
So way more experienced than I have with radio and audio recording.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.320
Hello and welcome Elektra.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.920
Enough of the flattering.

01:09.920 --> 01:12.320
Thanks for inviting me.

01:12.320 --> 01:18.400
So Elektra, both of us are from Berlin and at the time lived in Berlin.

01:18.400 --> 01:25.360
And the first time we met was actually in Brazil at the Free Software Conference Fissile

01:25.360 --> 01:26.520
there.

01:26.520 --> 01:33.720
And yeah, so I am wondering actually how you got involved in Free Software before we

01:33.720 --> 01:34.720
met there.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.720
So that's already done.

01:35.720 --> 01:41.840
Over 10 years ago, but I realized we haven't talked about how you actually got involved

01:41.840 --> 01:43.880
in the first place.

01:44.880 --> 01:50.560
Well, my first computer was the Commodore 16 and that sucked because nobody was bothering

01:50.560 --> 01:53.120
to write software for it.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.400
Everybody wanted a C64 back then.

01:55.400 --> 02:03.720
Then I had a PC, a 386 without co-processor was using DOS 5.0 for Microsoft and I actually

02:03.720 --> 02:12.480
was only doing text editing and designing printed circuit boards.

02:12.480 --> 02:20.080
And later I bought my first pensum PC and that used Windows 95 and it was just a bummer.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.080
Nothing did work.

02:22.080 --> 02:27.680
And then yeah, since I'm an electronics person, I often shopped in electronic stores and

02:27.680 --> 02:31.680
they had redhead Linux and Susie Linux in a box.

02:31.680 --> 02:38.200
And at one point I bought Linux in a box and the first thing was the command line is so

02:38.200 --> 02:43.880
comfortable and I got an entire planet of opportunities.

02:43.880 --> 02:51.800
Like all the universities, all the machines, all the stuff you need to do something.

02:51.800 --> 02:58.600
It was all there and was all open waiting for me to play with it like a big planet official

02:58.600 --> 03:01.240
technique but in software.

03:01.240 --> 03:07.840
It's also interesting because like for myself, the first GNU Linux distribution I got, I bought

03:07.880 --> 03:13.320
myself or I got it landed from a friend and then I bought others and we landed around.

03:13.320 --> 03:18.560
Nowadays most people, they just download it and often confuse free software with creative

03:18.560 --> 03:19.880
software.

03:19.880 --> 03:26.800
And for us, we had to buy it from the beginning, this association isn't so present there.

03:26.800 --> 03:33.800
So for you, it was the getting this large tool set empowering you in what you want to

03:33.800 --> 03:34.800
do.

03:34.800 --> 03:43.800
We plan it with all the resources for free and it also rang the bell of Mutual Aid.

03:43.800 --> 03:51.400
You probably know the book Mutual Aid by the Russian anarchist Krapodkin.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.840
I have to admit, no, I don't know it.

03:53.840 --> 03:57.360
Well, this is like a huge gap.

03:57.360 --> 04:04.760
You should read Mutual Aid because it's an anti-social Darwinist book.

04:05.760 --> 04:15.000
And he's proving that for the flourishment of the species, it is important that the individuals

04:15.000 --> 04:17.280
from the species, they help each other.

04:17.280 --> 04:23.520
So survival is not the battle of the fittest and only the fittest one survives.

04:23.520 --> 04:30.600
The fittest species is also that one where the individuals help each other.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.680
So that's, yeah, that's in a nutshell.

04:34.680 --> 04:40.000
So when I think about how we first met, that was when you were, when people asked you

04:40.000 --> 04:44.880
to help with setting up machine networking also there in in Brazil, right?

04:44.880 --> 04:51.360
So we're in the favelias there and looking where could we build the antennas?

04:51.360 --> 04:55.480
How did you end up in this area of work?

04:55.480 --> 05:01.040
Well, I was always fascinated with wireless communication with radio.

05:01.080 --> 05:05.040
I think I was like eight or nine when I've built my first radio.

05:05.040 --> 05:10.560
It was a simple detector radio and probably a bit younger when I first built my first

05:10.560 --> 05:16.040
circuits and radio always has fascinated me.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.920
And there was also the reason why I got involved in electronics.

05:19.920 --> 05:24.840
At first I was more involved in electronics rather than in programming and computing,

05:24.840 --> 05:29.480
but computers of course, so the Department of Electronics.

05:29.480 --> 05:36.160
So it was also fascinating and, yeah, then the came the internet and a minute in the

05:36.160 --> 05:45.720
internet was like two cents back then and so you had to count the minutes and, yeah.

05:45.720 --> 05:51.200
And then the first DSL lines came and there was the opportunity to share those lines via

05:51.280 --> 05:55.240
radio and so I started to build some wireless technology.

05:55.240 --> 06:00.360
There was pre-WIFI, WIFI was already there, but it was an affordable.

06:00.360 --> 06:06.880
And so when WIFI became affordable and there was a budget for that community, I was involved

06:06.880 --> 06:08.560
in the low tech.

06:08.560 --> 06:13.440
It was like before the term hacker space, mecherspace was coined.

06:13.440 --> 06:20.080
There were these groups of like squatters basically in the Netherlands and in Germany that

06:20.080 --> 06:24.680
were setting up internet cafes and training centers for open stores, teaching people

06:24.680 --> 06:31.560
how to use GPG, how to install Linux or open BSD or free BSD or whatever.

06:31.560 --> 06:36.840
Well, that's now more than 20 years ago, 25, 26 years.

06:36.840 --> 06:41.840
And that was also the time when you Electra got involved with Batman.

06:42.320 --> 06:53.760
No, Batman was an invention I made together with Thomas Lopatik in 2005, 2006 because I was

06:53.760 --> 07:03.160
hacking on mesh routing protocols because routing and forwarding is a natural extension

07:03.160 --> 07:10.280
if you do radio communication because every radio communication device has a limited range.

07:10.280 --> 07:16.920
But if there are other devices that mutually help in the forwarding data, then you can

07:16.920 --> 07:23.360
build a cloud like a beehive where everybody is connected to everybody else, regardless

07:23.360 --> 07:25.760
of the individual range.

07:25.760 --> 07:32.280
So all the machines are contributing to build an infrastructure which is based on multi-point

07:32.280 --> 07:37.960
to multi-point networking, radio communication is always a broadcast.

07:37.960 --> 07:44.560
It's an artificial limitation if Wi-Fi networks provide hotspots where all the clients

07:44.560 --> 07:49.400
need the central hotspot in order to communicate with each other.

07:49.400 --> 07:54.840
And since the Wi-Fi protocols, since the beginning, at least in theory supported the

07:54.840 --> 08:01.600
ad hoc mode, which is basically multi-point to multi-point communication in 800.11, I got

08:01.600 --> 08:08.200
the idea that we need some kind of software that organizes the interconnection between

08:08.200 --> 08:14.080
those devices so that every device relates traffic for every other device if needed and

08:14.080 --> 08:16.640
this can be done over multiple hops.

08:16.640 --> 08:22.480
So you can cover an entire area with such a network and it would be license-free, it can

08:22.480 --> 08:25.560
operate in a license-free band.

08:25.560 --> 08:34.160
And so this idea was ripe even before I joined Freifunk, but when I joined the Freifunk

08:34.160 --> 08:41.400
community at the beginning, I wrote a Wikipedia article in the Freifunk Wiki and explained

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
the idea.

08:42.400 --> 08:47.400
And to my surprise, there was a crowd of people that were excited about the idea and that's

08:47.400 --> 08:54.720
how machine networking at Freifunk essentially started here in Berlin.

08:54.720 --> 08:59.880
And can you explain again what bad man then exactly is with the machine networking now?

08:59.880 --> 09:06.840
That's the, you explain that, that it's enlarging the range of the network and all the peers

09:06.840 --> 09:10.840
help each other to reach the other peers.

09:10.840 --> 09:16.600
Well in the field of machine networking, so radio-based machine networking with multi-point

09:16.600 --> 09:23.040
to multi-point, capable radios, there are different types of protocols.

09:23.040 --> 09:26.720
Some are proactive and some are reactive.

09:26.720 --> 09:31.360
Reactive protocols, we can just skip there only trying to learn about the existence of

09:31.360 --> 09:37.240
the network and how they can get from A to B if there is a demand while proactive networking

09:37.240 --> 09:43.480
protocols, they always try to have an idea of the network so that if you want to send

09:43.480 --> 09:49.200
something from A to B, you already can scan the network to see who is there and then

09:49.200 --> 09:55.840
you decide I want to send something to B. And in the field of the proactive protocols,

09:55.840 --> 10:04.280
there were, yeah, there are the link state protocols and they try to calculate a graph involving

10:04.280 --> 10:09.400
all the vectors between all these individual nodes in the network.

10:09.400 --> 10:19.080
And calculating this graph is immensely costing in CPU and RAM and also in network traffic.

10:20.080 --> 10:28.080
And on top of that all, the optimized link state routing algorithm OLSR, it's one of these

10:28.080 --> 10:35.320
link state routing algorithms, it created routing loops, it didn't work as promised.

10:35.320 --> 10:39.840
So it was one of the protocols that we tried in Berlin and at least Berlin is still using

10:39.840 --> 10:40.840
it.

10:40.840 --> 10:47.520
I didn't manage to convince the Berlin community to make the switch from OLSR entirely

10:47.520 --> 10:55.720
to Batman back then, it was like 2006, the first Batman code was written.

10:55.720 --> 11:07.280
And so the idea is to have proactive protocol that is loop free and consumes less networking

11:07.280 --> 11:13.760
overhead in protocol messages, less CPU power and less RAM.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.640
And yeah, Batman algorithm has achieved that.

11:17.640 --> 11:23.600
So I mean, maybe it makes sense that you explained to some of the listeners who aren't familiar

11:23.600 --> 11:29.800
with RIFU from out of Germany what that is and that you accomplished in Berlin with that.

11:29.800 --> 11:37.800
It's a community network where people built their own infrastructure based on radio.

11:37.800 --> 11:42.880
Not all open community networks on the planet are only using radio, but at least here

11:42.880 --> 11:48.880
for Berlin and for Germany in general.

11:48.880 --> 11:54.520
It's based on Wi-Fi because here regulations and so on and such are so complicated, it's

11:54.520 --> 12:00.960
easier to set up wireless links than to dig up streets and areas and put your own fiber

12:00.960 --> 12:01.960
into the ground.

12:01.960 --> 12:08.040
There are other communities like the GIFI network in Catalonia, in Spain.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.560
They dig their own fibers.

12:11.560 --> 12:16.040
And there are other communities properly as well that do this.

12:16.040 --> 12:19.880
But yeah, we're building our own infrastructure.

12:19.880 --> 12:26.960
And it's basically also a technology to deliver services to the last mile.

12:26.960 --> 12:32.520
That's when you roll out internet connectivity or a network.

12:32.520 --> 12:38.680
Then yes, of course, you can have a fiber line from a major city to another major city.

12:38.680 --> 12:42.920
But then you have to distribute it to the households, for example, to the individual

12:42.920 --> 12:45.520
people wherever they live.

12:45.520 --> 12:51.160
And one way to do that is of course, with radio and mesh networking can help that.

12:51.160 --> 12:55.240
So what we're doing is not local area networking.

12:55.240 --> 13:02.800
We're doing like metropolitan area networking or yeah, in a certain district, people can

13:02.800 --> 13:04.720
use that technology.

13:04.880 --> 13:09.200
Yeah, and of course, there's much more to explain to that, which would be way out of

13:09.200 --> 13:11.560
the scope of your podcast.

13:11.560 --> 13:21.280
And I mean, for cities or like Berlin or also countries like Germany, the aspects you

13:21.280 --> 13:28.280
talked about before that you need more CPU, more RAM for the other protocol before that

13:28.280 --> 13:33.920
might not be such a big issue, right, because a lot of people they can afford to have that

13:33.920 --> 13:39.200
they have enough energy resources, often available to do that.

13:39.200 --> 13:45.280
I could imagine that this is completely different for the other work you did in some of the

13:45.280 --> 13:53.520
developing countries where it's very more difficult with the energy or yes, it's the

13:53.520 --> 13:58.640
filter I'm operating in, please, everybody don't get me wrong.

13:58.640 --> 14:04.000
If you can afford to put fiber to every household, please do so.

14:04.000 --> 14:11.400
But if you're in an area where money is limited, where energy resources are limited, where

14:11.400 --> 14:19.080
you want to have a basic service quickly, you can roll it out with wireless technology.

14:19.080 --> 14:23.840
It doesn't have, it's not always only mesh, it can be point-to-point backbone links and

14:23.840 --> 14:25.520
the backbone network.

14:25.520 --> 14:30.760
And the mesh is then that part that delivers it individually to the households, it's

14:30.760 --> 14:34.440
so solving the problem of the last mile.

14:34.440 --> 14:39.360
That's also why I got involved in South Africa with the Council for Scientific and Industrial

14:39.360 --> 14:40.360
Research.

14:40.360 --> 14:48.280
They had a program last mile, first inch, there was a development program where they were

14:48.280 --> 14:54.760
looking for delivering internet access to households in South Africa.

14:54.760 --> 15:00.840
And beside being a software developer for a very long time now, you're also developing

15:00.840 --> 15:05.680
open hardware there for accomplishing those projects.

15:05.680 --> 15:13.320
So I am there, there's one part that you create mesh networks with powered by solar power.

15:13.320 --> 15:17.560
Can you explain a little bit how hard that came to happen and what the challenges there

15:17.560 --> 15:18.560
were?

15:18.560 --> 15:23.000
I think you're referring to the mesh potato, maybe.

15:23.000 --> 15:30.920
While I was working in South Africa at the Meraka Institute in Chvane, I got in contact

15:30.920 --> 15:36.360
with Steve Song, who was working for the shuttle Valve foundation, and he had the idea to

15:36.360 --> 15:42.520
the project village Telco, the idea of providing voiceover IP services over a solar powered

15:42.520 --> 15:47.400
mesh network, or in general for mesh networks.

15:47.400 --> 15:54.200
And since I'm an electronic person, I got involved in developing parts of the electronics

15:54.200 --> 15:56.360
of the device.

15:56.360 --> 16:05.440
But this is history now, this happened in 2008, and it's already an exhibition artifact

16:05.440 --> 16:08.920
here in the German Technical Museum in Berlin.

16:08.920 --> 16:14.520
What are the current challenges in this field to make sure that more people get a network

16:14.520 --> 16:23.160
connection in places where you can't have fiber that easily?

16:23.160 --> 16:30.960
Well power and suitable radios, but there's already a number of people that are involved

16:30.960 --> 16:35.640
in that field, I'm just one of them today.

16:35.640 --> 16:39.400
So I was kind of a pioneer in that field.

16:39.400 --> 16:46.480
There are not people doing stuff with lower radios, like a text communication in disaster

16:46.480 --> 16:50.200
areas and stuff like this.

16:50.200 --> 16:57.520
And yeah, one of my projects that I'm doing at the moment is a device.

16:57.520 --> 17:02.240
It's the Freifunk Open Maximum Powerpoint tracker.

17:02.240 --> 17:09.680
There are several generations, one is based on an old 8-bit microcontroller, and now

17:09.680 --> 17:17.520
I'm using ESP32, which is like 32-bit and has Wi-Fi and lots of other gadgets built

17:17.520 --> 17:18.720
in.

17:18.720 --> 17:27.320
And it's essentially to design, to build independent wireless nodes operated with solar

17:27.320 --> 17:31.600
power, where you can monitor the solar system from afar.

17:31.600 --> 17:38.160
And if you have a Wi-Fi device, an extra device connected to it, you can monitor it as well,

17:38.160 --> 17:43.520
and you can turn it on and off, for example, if it has a software hanger and so on.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.600
So that's stuff that I'm doing at the moment.

17:45.600 --> 17:51.880
I mean, you already hinted at it a bit, but I mean, you're traveling many countries and

17:51.880 --> 17:52.880
you used to.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.880
You used to, at the moment not.

17:54.880 --> 18:01.000
Yes, when I was working in South Africa, I probably, yeah, I was one of these people that

18:01.000 --> 18:04.920
created an awful lot of pollution already.

18:04.920 --> 18:11.000
When we met at the Fisley, I wrote to the people, thanks, nice for inviting me, but I usually

18:11.000 --> 18:17.960
don't fry like 20,000 kilometers just for a weekend to give a talk.

18:17.960 --> 18:24.840
Are there other things for me that you want me to do so I can stay for at least a month?

18:24.840 --> 18:31.800
And so they had, and so I started to work in Chile and since I got in Chile.

18:31.800 --> 18:39.320
And later in Valparaiso, so I was already back then, I was aware that my traveling activity

18:39.320 --> 18:46.760
was contributing a huge amount of carbon dioxide to the planet and that we should try to avoid

18:46.760 --> 18:47.760
this.

18:47.760 --> 18:54.320
So I had a personal feeling that I'm also responsible for it, which you could criticize

18:54.320 --> 19:00.640
and say, hey, it's not you that is the problem, but yeah, I was aware of this and at the moment

19:00.640 --> 19:07.080
I'm no longer working in South Africa and I will only travel if it's really necessary

19:07.080 --> 19:09.560
for a really big, important project.

19:09.560 --> 19:15.040
So I reduced my number of flights by a great margin.

19:15.040 --> 19:23.360
And I mean, for me, it was the question I had there was mainly, I mean, the travel part

19:23.360 --> 19:31.320
is one part, which is a bit sometimes difficult and you have to spend a lot of time on that.

19:31.320 --> 19:36.040
But I mean, in general, I was thinking about your involvement and all the energy you put

19:36.040 --> 19:45.080
into all of this work in the last years where it's usually not done by some few hours

19:45.080 --> 19:51.440
a day where you are involved in that and you get some money for that and that's all

19:51.440 --> 19:52.640
of why you are doing this.

19:52.640 --> 19:58.360
So I mean, you are working on this for other reasons and that was the question I was getting

19:58.360 --> 20:05.080
at what, why are you working on all of that and putting so much energy and time of you

20:05.080 --> 20:06.480
into this?

20:06.480 --> 20:13.360
Well, my idea was like that democratizing communication, so giving communication to

20:13.360 --> 20:20.560
everyone and sharing knowledge according to the principle of mutual aid, coming back

20:20.560 --> 20:27.080
to the Kropotkin, works for the betterment of mankind.

20:27.080 --> 20:32.840
We are all standing on the shoulders of giants, the language that we use, the knowledge that

20:32.840 --> 20:40.280
we have, the maps that we use, all that has been created by other humans in the past.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.760
And we are all building on top of others.

20:43.760 --> 20:49.160
And there are people on this planet that are pretty much excluded from that.

20:49.160 --> 20:52.840
Because the resources are not there.

20:52.840 --> 21:02.080
So my idea was to improve the betterment of human society by democratizing communications.

21:02.080 --> 21:07.360
But on the other hand at the moment, I'm also a little bit depressed because with the ability

21:07.360 --> 21:15.840
for everyone to communicate, it was also increasing the level of where people start communicating

21:15.840 --> 21:18.560
hatred and disinformation and so on.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.720
So it's a two-bladed sword.

21:21.720 --> 21:28.960
But I hope that that edge that supports mankind will finally prevail.

21:28.960 --> 21:35.240
I think that's something for many developers when they see that there's also things done

21:35.240 --> 21:43.640
with what they created that they don't think that is something fitting into their worldview

21:43.640 --> 21:45.440
or how people should behave.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.080
That's very difficult.

21:47.080 --> 21:51.880
On the other hand, it's then when you are for open communication and you want people

21:51.880 --> 21:58.280
to work together and the question is like if you start limiting some of the things that

21:58.280 --> 22:03.000
can be done, what good things would you prevent in the world?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Yeah.

22:04.000 --> 22:11.200
Well, this is like you're either promoting open communication, which I still do wholeheartedly

22:11.200 --> 22:18.280
or you don't.

22:18.280 --> 22:24.840
Which would bring us to other fields of censorship, control, surveillance, you know, once you have

22:24.840 --> 22:31.080
an open communication system where people share data and talk about themselves, they can

22:31.080 --> 22:34.520
also be the target of surveillance and so on.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.280
So this is an even another aspect.

22:37.280 --> 22:43.560
That is still sent by my optimism that it is for the benefit of mankind.

22:43.560 --> 22:50.960
And it's just something you can offer back then when I had the idea to Batman to get

22:50.960 --> 22:52.560
it with Thomas.

22:52.560 --> 22:56.720
I got so excited that it would be such a beautiful protocol and then it took me a couple

22:56.720 --> 23:04.160
of hours until I realized, oh, but if that mesh communication protocol is really so powerful

23:04.160 --> 23:11.320
and can do so, can organize communication so well sooner or later the military will

23:11.320 --> 23:14.600
also look for a protocol and that's what happened.

23:14.600 --> 23:22.480
And back then when we started the website open mesh org and open mesh net, we registered

23:22.480 --> 23:25.800
both URLs and I'm still keeping it.

23:25.800 --> 23:32.840
We came up with a license where we took the GPL and we added some comment that the protocol

23:32.840 --> 23:39.720
is only legal to be used in non-military and non-surveillance activities.

23:39.720 --> 23:47.320
We actually asked the Free Software Foundation and we got to reply, don't do it, don't

23:47.320 --> 23:56.320
add more licenses and yeah, well, in the end, the military guys that we saw in our IP

23:56.320 --> 24:02.800
logs, one of them approached us and said, I'm sitting on the board and I try to convince

24:02.800 --> 24:07.880
my fellow people that they use your protocol because it's cool.

24:07.880 --> 24:11.520
But with that name, bad man, nobody's taking it serious.

24:11.520 --> 24:14.840
Can you please change the name of your project?

24:14.840 --> 24:18.640
So he never got a reply to that email.

24:18.640 --> 24:25.720
And there's also people that complained that we did that step and removed that part in

24:25.720 --> 24:29.240
the license, non-military and non-surveillance.

24:29.240 --> 24:30.240
So that's now removed.

24:30.240 --> 24:38.240
We removed it back then after getting feedback and some people are complaining that we did

24:38.240 --> 24:39.240
it.

24:39.240 --> 24:49.240
It's not a free software license anymore from the definition, but yes, it's very hard.

24:49.240 --> 24:54.200
I think that your approach then, that's something which I hear from a lot of developers that

24:54.200 --> 24:59.080
they choose a free software license because they want to make sure that all the positive

24:59.080 --> 25:03.280
things can develop out of it and that we don't go into a direction where then people are

25:03.280 --> 25:09.840
adding other restrictions and then you, after some time, you disable people to actually

25:09.840 --> 25:10.840
work together.

25:10.840 --> 25:14.280
But on the other hand, it doesn't mean that you have to fully support things that you

25:14.280 --> 25:16.520
don't approve and you don't have to reply people.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.040
You don't have to give them support.

25:18.040 --> 25:22.640
You don't have to do special development for them just because they offer money and all

25:22.640 --> 25:23.640
of that.

25:23.880 --> 25:32.280
Well, the conclusions that we have drawn back then was we are not going to patent the algorithms.

25:32.280 --> 25:37.880
So when they see what we're doing, they can study what we're doing and they can just

25:37.880 --> 25:39.360
re-implement it.

25:39.360 --> 25:45.240
And since it's military and they can just keep it secret, you can just copy our code.

25:45.240 --> 25:49.960
And I guess a legal fight would be pointless.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.800
Yeah.

25:52.800 --> 25:59.680
One topic I wanted to quickly go into as well, now some shift from, I'm sorry, but actually

25:59.680 --> 26:04.880
maybe it's not too far because it's also about, yeah, others controlling you.

26:04.880 --> 26:09.240
So at the FSFE, we work on initiative.

26:09.240 --> 26:16.520
It's a route of freedom where we want to achieve it that the ISP, the Internet Service

26:16.520 --> 26:22.160
provider cannot tell you what route or you have to use in your at home, but that you

26:22.160 --> 26:24.440
can decide yourself.

26:24.440 --> 26:35.280
So from your perspective, is this a huge problem in Europe that the ISPs can just decide

26:35.280 --> 26:40.920
there or for mesh networking or is it something where you think that this doesn't have a huge

26:40.920 --> 26:46.640
impact on the, on possibility of, of more community networks?

26:46.640 --> 26:52.400
Well, when you talk about the router lockdown, what immediately comes to my memory is that

26:52.400 --> 27:00.080
I signed a letter to get rid of Tim Berners-Lee and other people against the idea of the Federal

27:00.080 --> 27:07.080
Communications Commission trying to ban open WOT and Open Source.

27:07.080 --> 27:11.000
Can you quickly say what, what open WRT is?

27:11.000 --> 27:20.760
Well, back then, links is they had a router that WRT 54G and some folks discovered, hey,

27:20.760 --> 27:22.560
this is using GPL software.

27:22.560 --> 27:28.600
So for Fox sake, you have to publish your sources.

27:28.600 --> 27:32.720
And so they had to comply and they actually did at one point.

27:32.720 --> 27:38.280
So people starting hacking these devices and they were immensely useful because they

27:38.280 --> 27:47.160
were like 8002.11 G hardware with two antennas, quite, actually quite good hardware.

27:47.160 --> 27:50.400
And so it was, it was possible to liberate the hardware.

27:50.400 --> 27:56.520
And for like 60 euros, at the beginning, maybe 80 euros, it was a lot of bang for the

27:56.520 --> 27:57.960
buck back then these days.

27:57.960 --> 28:03.240
It's like a wireless router, like 10 to 15 euros, the cheapest ones.

28:03.240 --> 28:13.200
So that enabled us to build fry-funk networks at a much higher pace and much higher penetration

28:13.200 --> 28:16.240
and made it much, much more easier.

28:16.240 --> 28:21.000
Some clever guys from the Open Source community came up with patches and so on.

28:21.000 --> 28:31.560
So it was a big success and thanks to the GPL-ing and publishing the sources, a project was

28:31.560 --> 28:38.160
created and since it was a project about hacking that wireless router from links and it was

28:38.160 --> 28:44.360
to WRT 54G, the project had to got the name open WRT.

28:44.360 --> 28:50.960
But of course, these days, that's the history and it's now for all kinds of wireless

28:51.080 --> 28:55.440
devices and it's a very great Linux distribution.

28:55.440 --> 29:03.000
It's a meta-distribution that you learn to use in order to support your wireless device

29:03.000 --> 29:08.800
and not only wireless devices, there's also going into the Raspberry Pi and so on.

29:08.800 --> 29:13.400
But clearly the focus is on wireless routing technology.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.840
That's what they refer to today.

29:15.840 --> 29:23.520
So today, don't think of the links anymore, think of wireless routing technology, open

29:23.520 --> 29:25.760
Linux distribution.

29:25.760 --> 29:31.240
And you were at explaining that you wrote a letter or signed a letter with Tim Berns-Lee

29:31.240 --> 29:32.240
together?

29:32.240 --> 29:38.440
And others against the Federal Communication Commission of the United States because they

29:38.440 --> 29:47.840
initiated an attempt to ban open WRT altogether from devices in the United States.

29:47.840 --> 29:52.400
And unfortunately, the European Commission is following that.

29:52.400 --> 29:58.360
So they're coming up with regulations, they say a virus radius can do damage, think

29:58.360 --> 30:06.320
they can do harm and so software freedom has to be abandoned because yeah, so and of

30:06.320 --> 30:12.480
course, why I mentioned this in this context is the argument is that banning open

30:12.480 --> 30:18.520
source would make networking infrastructure more unsafe.

30:18.520 --> 30:24.520
And this is of course a problem that you also mentioned on your website.

30:24.520 --> 30:32.280
One provider has like one million devices rolled out and there is no updates from the company.

30:32.280 --> 30:36.200
The company lost interest in updating the hardware.

30:36.200 --> 30:44.600
So you have to use an unsafe hardware that now in times of war with people, even from

30:44.600 --> 30:49.880
state actors, start attacking networks, this is a clear no go.

30:49.880 --> 30:55.320
On the other hand, if you are ISP and you have the same device everywhere, it's easier

30:55.320 --> 30:59.040
to roll out updates and so on and so forth.

30:59.040 --> 31:07.720
But users should not be forced to obey to a hardware lockdown.

31:07.720 --> 31:12.000
For most people, they are not too involved, there are not many people on this planet that

31:12.000 --> 31:18.400
start to configure their own device, they just sign up a contract and they just use whatever

31:18.400 --> 31:19.400
they get.

31:19.400 --> 31:24.360
And if it's not working, they call the hotline and the hotline tells them to restart the

31:24.360 --> 31:29.000
device and then everything is going to be fine.

31:29.000 --> 31:35.960
That's also one of the aims there for us in the area of device neutrality that some

31:35.960 --> 31:41.000
people might decide that they just use what they get provided.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.920
But on the other hand, that individuals, organizations, sometimes even larger organizations

31:46.920 --> 31:53.360
or even countries that they are able to choose other devices and still be able to communicate

31:53.360 --> 32:01.040
and still be able to act with those devices and accomplish their goals with that and

32:01.040 --> 32:04.800
had something with the route of freedom and the other part you mentioned with the radio

32:04.800 --> 32:09.480
equipment directive on the European level where we are also working on where there are

32:09.480 --> 32:15.640
sometimes really strange arguments why it should be prevented to use other software

32:15.640 --> 32:19.320
on radio capable hardware.

32:19.320 --> 32:25.960
It's completely overarching, the FCC was completely overarching and Europe just follows

32:25.960 --> 32:34.120
blindly and the problem is it's technology from technology devices, it's even not feasible

32:34.120 --> 32:41.680
what they're planning and it will make the planet more insecure and it's ludicrous because

32:41.680 --> 32:47.900
the Raspberry Pi for example is completely FCC approved but you can just use the GPI

32:47.900 --> 32:55.260
open from the device and you can broadcast whatever you like because modern day technology,

32:55.260 --> 33:01.580
modern day microcontrollers, CPUs, they are so flexible you can modulate whatever you like

33:01.580 --> 33:10.940
at what frequency you like and so this is like tell the sun to stop shining because it's

33:10.940 --> 33:17.740
too hot, it's ridiculous, it's ludicrous and that's also a lesson that I think some

33:17.740 --> 33:23.980
bureaucrats in the United States and in Europe have to learn and they hopefully learned

33:23.980 --> 33:24.980
it soon.

33:24.980 --> 33:30.460
It's a long way and I think about all the meetings we participated in and the arguments

33:30.460 --> 33:36.540
you hear there, it's something which really requires long, long time to explain it again

33:36.540 --> 33:41.100
and again and then some things happen and then under arguments that you brought before

33:41.100 --> 33:49.900
are then better understood and yeah but it's yeah a lot of work to get those arguments through.

33:49.900 --> 33:56.700
Well but their idea of control, where does it end, you kind of just stop there then you have to

33:58.140 --> 34:04.300
to ban on the electronic components that you buy, yeah you have to limit compilers,

34:05.100 --> 34:13.100
where does it end, where does it end, this is like it's utterly ridiculous and yeah let's hope

34:13.100 --> 34:18.220
that there is still a rest of sense in your brains.

34:18.220 --> 34:23.420
That's why it's so important that people like you that many other people who who joined us

34:23.420 --> 34:30.220
in those discussions there that they continue to talk with decision makers about that or support

34:30.300 --> 34:38.060
others in doing so so that we get those points across against the sometimes very big large

34:38.940 --> 34:47.500
lobby from other companies there but yeah I still, so I'm exploding the amount of time that you

34:47.500 --> 34:54.700
want to dedicate to the product so we have to come a little bit to the end but so one one question

34:54.700 --> 35:01.900
I wanted to ask you is with all that work in all that different countries and for such a long time

35:03.900 --> 35:11.100
what was the funniest most memorable exceptional thing that you think about when you think about

35:11.100 --> 35:18.460
like free software? Well the most memorable moment was when I reached the lowest south of South Africa

35:19.420 --> 35:27.180
in the area of Cape Town and I went to a very poor area and there were the blue linksys boxes

35:27.980 --> 35:36.380
running a fryphone firmware from Berlin and so that's when I really had to realize

35:37.500 --> 35:44.060
what we had done, what we had achieved that people living in a township

35:44.860 --> 35:48.940
had entered access thanks to software and ideas that were

35:51.020 --> 35:58.940
initiated somewhere here in the western world and I had the idea I would like I would love to

35:58.940 --> 36:06.540
just travel around and see this type of installations and maybe do a film about it

36:07.100 --> 36:12.300
that would have been cool but of course it would involve a huge amount of traveling

36:12.940 --> 36:19.500
but it clearly was like a very inspiring moment. I can imagine

36:20.620 --> 36:27.820
then I have to come to the last question and that's always when I talk to people the same one

36:27.820 --> 36:33.180
so on on the 14th of February we always celebrate the ala free software day where we ask people to

36:33.180 --> 36:40.300
thank other contributors, other groups, organizations out there for their work and I don't think

36:40.300 --> 36:47.260
we have to limit that to one day so I'm always asking my guests are there any developers,

36:47.260 --> 36:53.020
contributors, organizations out there whom you would like to thank for their work for free software?

36:53.020 --> 37:00.140
Oh dear there is too many to mention actually I can only talk about people that I was working

37:00.140 --> 37:07.420
with personally but already to people whose names I cannot remember because there are too many

37:08.060 --> 37:13.660
that provided me with that Linux experience with that Linux kernel and all the stuff that I

37:14.540 --> 37:18.620
that I had access to when I started using redhead Linux and later slackware

37:20.780 --> 37:25.980
but in particularly I would like to thank some folks that I have been working with like

37:25.980 --> 37:32.860
Thomas Lopartic who was coding with me Oles R and Batman. He was actually the major coder

37:33.820 --> 37:41.820
and Sven Ola took it from the from the Berlin-Fryphone community for his hacks on the WRT 54G

37:42.380 --> 37:48.940
and especially in the Broadcom driver Axel Neumann who supported me in Batman hand

37:48.940 --> 37:55.980
later forked to his own Batman project Simon Wunderlich. Sven Eichelmann you know there's

37:56.620 --> 38:04.380
there's many many names to to mention and I guess they're all all driven by by by this idea

38:05.100 --> 38:11.020
to share and contribute because actually this is what we humans in a positive sense are
