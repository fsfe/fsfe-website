      Think about these claims: <br />
		"It's better if we control how you may or may not use your tools." <br /> 
		"It's better if you don't know how your tools work." <br /> 
		"It's better if we forbid you to share your tools." <br /> 
		"It's better if you are not allowed to improve your tools." <br /> 
		If you find those as absurd as I do, you understand why I'm a Free Software activist.
