      <p>With CRA and PLD liability rules for software have been introduced with a broad exception for Free Software. After long and intense debates individual developers and non for profit work are safeguarded. In the future, individual developers and non-profit development of Free Software will be exempt from the CRA and the PLD. Nevertheless, the wording in both the regulations are different and a standardisation processes and guidelines are still being drawn up.<br />
In this talk Alexander Sander from the FSFE will discuss what this new regulation means for software freedom in future and what happens at this stage and how to be involved in implementation.</p>
