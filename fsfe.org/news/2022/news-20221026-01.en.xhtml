<p>
  The sixth edition of <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eudatathon">EU Datathon</a>, the 
  EU’s open data competition, came to a close last week with the awards 
  ceremony. The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) won the first 
  prize in the challenge ‘transparency in public procurement’ with a 
  program that helps analyse how public administrations in the European 
  Union spend their money.

<p>
  At the EU Datathon finals, that took place in Brussels as part of the 
  <a href="https://youth.europa.eu/year-of-youth_en">European Year of 
  Youth</a>, TEDective, the project submitted by the FSFE, ended up 
  winning one of the four proposed challenges, that Europe is currently 
  facing: the achievement of transparency in public procurement.
</p>

<p>
  Using open data this Free Software program empowers citizens by 
  making EU tendering data accesible to everyone who wants to consult 
  and use it. For example, it will allow a journalist to find out how 
  much money the government spends on Microsoft licenses and products, 
  but also to compare that spending with other regions in similar cases 
  or even in comparison with other countries.
</p>

<p>
  “Although it might seem boring at first sight, TED data reveals 
  crucial information about the economic activity of business and state 
  organisations alike. As, there was no Free Software solution making 
  this data accessible to non-experts, this is what we’re trying to do 
  with TEDective”, explains Linus Sehn, system administrator at FSFE 
  and one of the members of the TEDective team. This first prize, which 
  comes with a cash reward of 25,000 euros, willl contribute to raise 
  awareness to the need of making tendering data accesible and easy to 
  analyze.

  Developed with the help of <a href="https://weimann.digital/">Michael 
  Weimann</a>, and released as a <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE-compliant</a> project under a 
  Free Software (also known as Open Source) license, TEDective improves 
  access to the data published by <a href="https://ted.europa.eu/TED/browse/browseByMap.do">Tenders 
  Electronic Daily</a> (TED), fulfilling all of the following 
  requirements with regards to the provision of TED data: it is 
  available without costs for commercial as well as non-commercial use; 
  it is up-to-date (updates at least on a monthly basis), cleaned and 
  both buyers and suppliers are adequately deduplicated; and it can be 
  downloaded in bulk, making it available as Open Contracting Data 
  Standard (OCDS) to allow interoperability. Besides, it will be 
  designed, maintained and monitored transparently and in close 
  co-operation with all relevant stakeholders and user groups.
</p>

<p>
  Sustainably providing long-term access to European tendering data in 
  a way that fulfils these requirements could enable numerous 
  applications that are of interest to civil society, business, the 
  press, and beyond which could greatly enhance the transparency of 
  business activity in Europe. There are a range of interesting 
  questions that can be answered with this data if it was available in 
  a well-documented and easy-to-understand format that is interoperable 
  with tendering data published elsewhere.

<p>
  Empowering young people in the job market, reducing greenhouse 
  emissions, and bringing European cultural heritage closer to 
  citizens: these were some of the ambitions put forward by the 12 
  finalist teams of this year’s <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eudatathon">EU Datathon</a>. The 
  teams were shortlisted from an initial 156 entries from 38 countries, 
  the highest participation in the competition’s history, and competed 
  in four categories, all highly relevant to the challenges Europe 
  faces today: the European Green Deal, transparency in public 
  procurement, EU public procurement opportunities for young people, 
  and a Europe fit for the digital age.
</p>

<p>
  Prior to the finals, the finalists had the opportunity to present 
  their ideas for apps built on EU open data in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYiuDfq64-Y&amp;list=PLT5rARDev_rnik8jF6E8k5AjN5zeJmqXG">series 
  of videos </a>while, on the final day, they pitched their polished 
  apps to the jury of 14 open data experts and the online audience. In 
  his opening speech, Commissioner Johannes Hahn praised the teams’ 
  innovative approaches underlining that “There is also a strong 
  positive impact on accountability, transparency, participation, 
  inclusion and democracy, supporting core European values” while Ms 
  Hilde Hardeman, Director General of the Publications Office of the 
  EU, highlighted that “The European Union is well aware of the immense 
  opportunities data offer. We are truly determined to make the most 
  out of these, for our citizens, economies, societies”.
</p>

<p>
  The EU Datathon competition is organised annually by the <a href="https://op.europa.eu/">Publications Office of the European 
  Union,</a> in support of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/strategy-data">European 
  Strategy for Data</a><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/strategy-data">.</a> 
  The 2022 edition had the active support of over 20 partners, 
  representing open data stakeholders from both inside and outside the 
  EU institutions.
