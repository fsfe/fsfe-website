    <title>Fellowship meeting in Vienna</title>
    <body>
      The second Austrian Fellowship meeting takes place on 13 January starting
      at 18:00 in Vienna in the Otto-Wagner Pavillion near Karlsplatz in the
      side room upstairs, right hand from the staircase.

      Like last time, Karin Kosina and Reinhard MÃ¼ller will inform about FSFE's
      work, and we expect interesting discussions. A major discussion point
      this time will be "Free Software in education".

      This invitation addresses to all people interested in FSFE or Free
      Software.
