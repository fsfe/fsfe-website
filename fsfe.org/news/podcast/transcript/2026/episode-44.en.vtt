00:00.000 --> 00:05.160
It should be very more clear that we want and should invest in free software and that

00:05.160 --> 00:06.800
we want to get rid of big tech.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.440
We want to get rid of dependencies.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.120
We want to get rid of proprietary software.

00:10.120 --> 00:13.600
We want administrations that control technology.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.480
Hello, and welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.800
This podcast is brought to you by the Free Software Foundation, Europe.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.600
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.040
And I'm Bernie Mehring.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.320
And today I'm here with my colleague, Alexander Sander.

00:42.320 --> 00:43.120
Hi, Alex.

00:43.120 --> 00:43.640
Hi, Bernie.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.720
Nice to have you back.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.520
Yeah, happy new year.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.440
Happy new year to you, too.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.360
What has happened in the past weeks?

00:51.360 --> 00:54.480
Oh, I gained some more kilos, I think.

00:54.480 --> 00:57.320
So it was very tasty.

00:57.320 --> 01:01.240
Not only days, but other than that.

01:01.240 --> 01:05.200
Also, some things happened in the Free Software sphere.

01:05.200 --> 01:11.240
So there's also some updates which we want to share with you in our very first

01:11.240 --> 01:13.920
policy podcast episode here in the new year.

01:13.920 --> 01:18.760
And so loads of food and loads of free software.

01:18.760 --> 01:23.000
Sounds like a perfect and relaxing holiday, to be honest.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.120
Yeah, half half.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.360
OK.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.080
Which half is not a relaxing part?

01:29.080 --> 01:33.760
Well, well, there are a couple of consultations ongoing.

01:33.760 --> 01:38.120
And yeah, so this is also something which we want to address today in our

01:38.120 --> 01:38.600
podcast.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.880
So, and yeah, this keeps us busy.

01:40.880 --> 01:44.520
And also during holidays, we were working.

01:44.520 --> 01:51.440
And so by that, we haven't been only eating, but also working.

01:53.920 --> 01:54.440
OK.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.640
How about you?

01:57.640 --> 02:00.640
I did not have that much chance to eat.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.920
I mean, there was enough food around at a 39C3.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.600
Yeah, you have been at the conquest, right?

02:05.600 --> 02:06.800
So how was it?

02:06.800 --> 02:07.800
I was really nice.

02:07.800 --> 02:13.080
It was like, there were a lot of people and it was just a special feeling of

02:13.080 --> 02:19.160
coming back to this very, very special Congress and conference that you can

02:19.160 --> 02:21.240
only experience with the CCC.

02:21.240 --> 02:25.760
So it's like an amazing event and it's amazing to be there.

02:25.760 --> 02:30.200
And we also had a podcast recording there with Heise, which I enjoyed quite a

02:30.200 --> 02:30.480
lot.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.480
It was about digital sovereignty.

02:32.480 --> 02:38.480
So one of the topics that we to cover extensively in this podcast as well.

02:38.480 --> 02:43.920
And it was really nice in German, sadly, only, but it was really nice to talk

02:43.920 --> 02:47.240
with Sven Neuhaus from the Zendis and Anne Roth.

02:47.240 --> 02:52.200
And of course, Keywan was also there from Heise and C't uplink.

02:52.200 --> 02:57.400
About their views on digital sovereignty and was, yeah, well done, I think.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.400
And it's worth a listen.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.800
I know that you have listened to it.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.800
Yeah, I have done so.

03:02.800 --> 03:03.800
Yeah.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.000
So I can recommend it definitely.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.400
So it's a very interesting hour and, yeah, also, as you said, it's very interesting

03:12.400 --> 03:13.400
to get some insights.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.400
Also, I think the mixed panel is very interesting.

03:16.400 --> 03:22.120
So we have people from tenders, as you said, so a governmental, yeah, more or less.

03:22.120 --> 03:28.760
We can see from Anna who is working in the Bundestag on the field of digital.

03:28.760 --> 03:34.800
And obviously you, as the expert professor of this, are really, really interesting balance

03:34.800 --> 03:35.800
talent.

03:35.800 --> 03:36.800
Thank you.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.800
Yeah.

03:37.800 --> 03:43.120
I also found it very entertaining to see the slightly different perspectives from the

03:43.120 --> 03:45.040
background that everybody brings along.

03:45.040 --> 03:51.800
So it also gives it a bit of a new and fresh air and to talk about this topic.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.760
I will link it in the show notes so that you can also find it and listen to it, our

03:55.760 --> 03:56.760
dear listeners.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.760
No, listen to it.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.760
It's really good.

03:59.760 --> 04:00.760
Yeah.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.760
All right.

04:02.760 --> 04:11.960
So, but for this day, we will also talk about the digital decade policy program, which

04:11.960 --> 04:19.200
wants to set up a monitoring and cooperation mechanism to achieve the common objectives

04:19.200 --> 04:23.200
and targets for Europe's digital transformation.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.200
This sounds...

04:24.200 --> 04:25.200
That's what the PR said.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.200
This is what the PR said.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.200
Yes.

04:28.200 --> 04:33.120
I was also like, okay.

04:33.120 --> 04:40.200
But it's the sentence that puts everything into one sentence, which does not really say

04:40.200 --> 04:41.200
much.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.200
Absolutely.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.080
So, can you take us through this?

04:45.080 --> 04:48.640
What exactly is the digital decade policy program?

04:48.640 --> 04:49.640
Yeah.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.640
Absolutely.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.040
It's another initiative by the European Commission.

04:53.040 --> 04:59.640
So it's a European Union program and, yeah, obviously they talk about a whole decade.

04:59.640 --> 05:05.280
So it's a program which lasts until 2030.

05:05.280 --> 05:12.880
So that's the aim for this and every year they come up with some new initiatives.

05:12.880 --> 05:20.240
They are also longer lasting than a year, but every year there's also some sort of evaluation

05:20.240 --> 05:21.240
report.

05:21.240 --> 05:26.440
And what they want to do in this digital decade policy program is to work basically on

05:26.440 --> 05:29.320
four topics, which is infrastructure.

05:29.320 --> 05:36.040
So they want to invest in a gigabit connectivity, European, whatever singing, then they want

05:36.040 --> 05:43.720
to invest or also the ability crown for digital business in Europe.

05:43.720 --> 05:52.840
They want to work on skills so that we have more ICT specialists here in Europe and ultimately

05:52.840 --> 06:00.080
government plays also role so that the key public services are online and that you have

06:00.080 --> 06:04.960
a EID and that you can access your health records online, stuff like this.

06:04.960 --> 06:12.000
So and yeah, we basically focus mostly on the part of government, but also business since

06:12.000 --> 06:15.640
business provides services for government.

06:15.640 --> 06:20.040
And this has spillover effects on skills, so these are the topics for us.

06:20.040 --> 06:25.680
We are interested in this digital decade policy program and what they do at the moment is

06:25.680 --> 06:31.640
to run a consultation to see what they can do in the next five years and what they might

06:31.640 --> 06:34.920
change or where they should put their focus on.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.720
And this is what we want to talk about today.

06:36.720 --> 06:44.240
So what can you contribute to this consultation and basically take on our views on this digital

06:44.240 --> 06:50.560
decade policy program and also like put it in a broader context.

06:50.560 --> 06:56.640
I mean, you'll listen probably to the other podcast episodes where we also talked about

06:56.640 --> 06:59.160
the financial situation.

06:59.160 --> 07:04.600
So the funding of free software also we talked a lot about procurement and stuff like

07:04.600 --> 07:05.600
this.

07:05.600 --> 07:14.840
So this is if you like just another program which is important for basically the use and

07:14.840 --> 07:19.280
spread of free software in administrations across Europe and we want to have a look

07:19.920 --> 07:23.160
at how is it working, what are they doing at the moment, where are we at the moment and

07:23.160 --> 07:28.840
what can we expect from the next five years and what do we do demand basically for the

07:28.840 --> 07:33.120
next five years in this digital decade policy program.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.120
Right.

07:34.120 --> 07:39.000
You've already covered some of the points that they consider important for the digital decade

07:39.000 --> 07:41.280
policy program.

07:41.280 --> 07:49.200
And where they constructed and what's the aim of this in total like what do they want

07:49.200 --> 07:51.240
to achieve.

07:51.240 --> 07:57.640
So I mean, we also talked about the digital Europe program which has a slightly comparable

07:57.640 --> 08:03.520
name so to say if you like, which was set up in light of the Corona crisis that the

08:03.520 --> 08:09.520
opinion and figured out that we are pretty much dependent on big tech and that it's very

08:09.520 --> 08:13.960
difficult to have sewer and IT infrastructure.

08:13.960 --> 08:18.120
So they started to work on this digital Europe program in order to address this.

08:18.120 --> 08:23.480
And then next to it, they came up with this digital decade policy program which is if

08:23.480 --> 08:30.440
you like a bit broader, but it also basically addressed the same topics like cybersecurity.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.280
They talk about a set infrastructure stuff like this.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.560
So it's a bit broader in terms of like it's not only about software, it's about digital

08:38.560 --> 08:45.560
in general and there are also some, so to say, soft goals in this like, as I said, they

08:45.560 --> 08:54.960
want to have more skills in Europe and for this they have several project programs.

08:54.960 --> 08:58.560
But most of this is also like voluntary.

08:58.560 --> 09:03.680
So the commission tries to stimulate cooperation between member states.

09:03.680 --> 09:11.360
They try to come up with projects and ideas and want to basically make sure that member

09:11.360 --> 09:17.120
states collaborate on this field of digital and particularly when you think about the free

09:17.120 --> 09:21.200
software with its four freedoms to use that you share and improve.

09:21.200 --> 09:26.760
For us, it's pretty obvious that free software should play a very, very important role in

09:26.760 --> 09:28.160
all of this.

09:28.240 --> 09:33.960
I can say it plays a role, but it could be way more proactive.

09:33.960 --> 09:39.640
It could be way more ambitious and this is basically also what we put in our feedback

09:39.640 --> 09:45.640
and we want to have this is also what we what we talked about the funding part.

09:45.640 --> 09:51.000
We want to have this everything a bit more sustainable and a bit more mid and long term

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
oriented.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.640
And often when we talk about the opinion and we see pilot projects, we see some loose

09:57.640 --> 10:05.880
corporations, everything is a bit cracky so you don't know if it's still there tomorrow.

10:05.880 --> 10:09.240
It's pretty much depending on member states initiatives.

10:09.240 --> 10:13.480
So if they want to step in, if they want to contribute, if they want to collaborate

10:13.480 --> 10:20.440
and to be honest, I would love to see a bit more pressure and power behind this and also

10:20.440 --> 10:26.880
some more clarity on how important free software is in order to achieve this.

10:26.880 --> 10:33.760
So what they, for example, have done in the past is to come up with the edic consortium.

10:33.760 --> 10:37.720
So it's the European Digital Infrastructure Consortium.

10:37.720 --> 10:43.200
So there are a couple of initiatives and one of these initiatives, one of these consortias

10:43.200 --> 10:51.880
is around digital technological, so Renety, this was set up during the summit for European

10:51.880 --> 10:56.200
digital sovereignty, which was happening in Berlin in November.

10:56.200 --> 11:01.160
My colleague, Johannes, have been there and they are during that event, they have been

11:01.160 --> 11:06.720
launching this consortium, so it's a pretty new thing.

11:06.720 --> 11:14.600
And it's bringing together member states, namely France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy.

11:14.600 --> 11:19.880
It's more or less supported by Luxembourg and Slovenia and there are some observers as

11:19.880 --> 11:25.400
well, Poland and Belgium that might also join as members very soon here.

11:25.400 --> 11:31.600
So you see, it's basically some member states coming together that want to work on this topic

11:31.600 --> 11:34.280
of technological sovereignty.

11:34.280 --> 11:39.320
For Germany, for example, it's a sovereign tech agency that works on cybersecurity as

11:39.320 --> 11:44.560
well as the tenders, the organization which you just mentioned related to your podcast

11:44.560 --> 11:50.440
where you attend it, so which is basically a state-owned company that comes up with open

11:50.440 --> 11:58.440
desk, so on free software solution, for administrations to have a digital sovereign workplace.

11:58.440 --> 12:05.880
So and they want to collaborate in this consortium in order to come up with pool of resources.

12:05.880 --> 12:13.360
They want to share strategic best practices and ultimately maybe even code.

12:13.360 --> 12:20.280
And this is happening in such a initiative, which is basically supported or which is basically

12:20.280 --> 12:23.400
coming from this digital decade policy program.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.760
So by thus, you can see how it works.

12:25.760 --> 12:31.800
So you have basically the umbrella with the digital decade policy program and under this umbrella,

12:31.800 --> 12:37.000
you have other initiatives that are going to be set up or that are already running like

12:37.000 --> 12:41.080
this edit consortium on technological sovereignty.

12:41.080 --> 12:47.520
And here, member states that are willing to work together, are coming together and do so.

12:47.520 --> 12:53.960
And here you can also see that it's not covering every member state in the European Union nor

12:53.960 --> 13:00.200
doesn't cover, so to say a European Union wide approach, it's more or less a coalition

13:00.200 --> 13:04.680
of member states that are willing to work together, that are willing to collaborate

13:04.720 --> 13:11.960
and that then come up with strategy solutions and hopefully a lot of free software,

13:11.960 --> 13:14.160
which is then used among them.

13:14.160 --> 13:19.160
For me, the question remains, how do we make sure it spreads across Europe?

13:19.160 --> 13:26.640
How do we involve other member states and how do we make sure that they really make progress?

13:26.640 --> 13:30.880
Do you see that the European Commission is doing something in this regard

13:30.880 --> 13:37.680
or are they still waiting for member states who get active by themselves?

13:37.680 --> 13:41.080
I mean, they do a lot of public relations around it.

13:41.080 --> 13:46.360
Also, I do believe that this summit helped to promote this edit lounge,

13:46.360 --> 13:50.000
but at the same time, this is something which I learned from Johannes,

13:50.000 --> 13:54.800
who was at this summit for European digital sovereignty when this editing was launched,

13:54.800 --> 13:59.120
that free software didn't play that major role there.

13:59.120 --> 14:04.880
So it was more around this, by European, made in Europe, arguments,

14:04.880 --> 14:13.040
the ministers have talked a lot to SAP, and they didn't talk that much to the free software companies there.

14:13.040 --> 14:16.640
One could say they have been around, they have been recognized,

14:16.640 --> 14:27.080
but there is still not the relevance and the importance of their plays in all of this,

14:27.080 --> 14:31.400
is still not seen or addressed accordingly, I'd say.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.720
So there is way more room for improvement.

14:34.720 --> 14:38.080
I do believe it's a good first step, but there should be way more,

14:38.080 --> 14:41.960
and this is also what I always say when we talk about funding,

14:41.960 --> 14:44.000
it needs to be sustainable, right?

14:44.000 --> 14:48.960
So we need to make sure that when they come up with these kinds of activities,

14:48.960 --> 14:54.280
that they are mid and long-term oriented, that they receive the needed funding,

14:54.280 --> 15:02.320
that they get resources, and that ultimately, the solutions they come up with are also used, right?

15:02.320 --> 15:05.520
So it's not just about coming up with projects and saying,

15:05.520 --> 15:07.480
look, now we have an alternative.

15:07.480 --> 15:12.760
It's also about using these alternatives, and this is ultimately administrations.

15:12.760 --> 15:17.320
So for example, if you look at the Ministry for Digitalization in Germany,

15:17.320 --> 15:22.560
this is for me, obviously, the first ministry that should switch to Open Desk

15:22.560 --> 15:28.960
and make sure they use it and show other administrations, institutions,

15:28.960 --> 15:37.680
that it's working, and here we can also see that they struggle to spread their solutions

15:37.680 --> 15:46.160
and that they really do migrations and replace the dependencies that they build over the last decades.

15:46.160 --> 15:52.160
And here, I do believe the opinion that also member states could be very more ambitious

15:52.160 --> 15:57.760
and actually act and use these solutions they come up with

15:57.760 --> 16:03.600
and not just put them in the niche and put some nice PR around it,

16:03.600 --> 16:09.120
but also implement and go forward and get rid of these dependencies,

16:09.120 --> 16:14.640
get rid of proprietary software, and go in the direction of free software,

16:14.640 --> 16:21.200
since this is the obvious choice to achieve digital sovereignty when we talk about software.

16:21.200 --> 16:26.720
You mentioned that free software is not yet recognized as the important role it plays

16:26.720 --> 16:31.840
because free software is everywhere, and you and our listeners, you all know this,

16:31.840 --> 16:35.680
how important free software is to our digital life and our digital infrastructure.

16:36.960 --> 16:41.600
What are we, the FSFE, doing to promote the standing of free software?

16:41.600 --> 16:45.120
Because this is one of our core activities.

16:45.440 --> 16:53.600
Absolutely. I mean, as I said, there is the ongoing consultation on this digital decade policy

16:53.600 --> 17:00.320
program in order to give feedback to the commission how we do believe the next five years should look

17:00.320 --> 17:06.880
like. Basically, what I was just referring to in the last minutes is what we put in writing in

17:06.880 --> 17:13.360
this consultation. We ask for sustainable long term funding. We ask for free software first

17:13.360 --> 17:20.000
policy. We ask to basically also use these kinds of solutions. This is what we put in the consultation,

17:20.000 --> 17:25.600
and we do not stop with this consultation, and we also do not stop with the digital decade policy

17:25.600 --> 17:32.000
program. We also directly talk to decision makers in the European Union, the commission,

17:32.720 --> 17:37.040
but also the parliament. We also work on member states level, and by thus also try to

17:37.120 --> 17:44.880
influence the council position here. Also, next to these programs, we also had the podcast on

17:44.880 --> 17:52.000
procurement. There's also this ongoing consultation on the impact assessment on the procurement

17:52.000 --> 17:58.800
reform, where they talk a lot about by European or made in Europe, and maybe, for example,

17:58.800 --> 18:03.360
at rest, that free software is something global and that you should have an eye on this as well,

18:04.000 --> 18:10.080
and ultimately, also next to the digital decade policy program and the procurement reform,

18:10.080 --> 18:17.920
there's also ongoing consultation, which is pretty, pretty new on the open source strategy

18:17.920 --> 18:23.520
of the European Union, so there is basically, you can also find this on our media channels,

18:25.040 --> 18:30.960
where we give feedback on an evaluation of the European open source strategy,

18:31.520 --> 18:36.880
and this is about to be renewed now, and here we will also take part in the consultation,

18:36.880 --> 18:42.640
and this is also what I meant earlier when we started the podcast. There are lots of

18:42.640 --> 18:49.360
consultations ongoing at the moment, so we are producing a lot of paper work at the moment,

18:49.360 --> 18:56.320
and give feedback to the commission on all of the digital and free software policies, procurement,

18:56.320 --> 19:05.200
but also funding, and what we try to achieve is to give them a big picture and to combine

19:05.200 --> 19:13.120
activities in several fields, and to basically not only talk about the digital decade policy

19:13.120 --> 19:18.880
program, but also procurement, but also a budget of the European Union and the open source strategy.

19:18.880 --> 19:25.360
We also talked about stacks, you know the European commission is also working towards open

19:25.360 --> 19:31.360
internet stack, where we also try to make sure that free software plays a very more important role,

19:31.360 --> 19:37.440
and what we can see in all of this is that free software somehow plays a role, but we do believe

19:37.440 --> 19:42.880
it should play a very more important role, it should be very more clear that we want and should

19:42.880 --> 19:49.360
invest in free software, and that we want to get rid of big tech, we want to get rid of dependencies,

19:49.360 --> 19:55.280
we want to get rid of proprietary software, we want administrations that control technology,

19:55.280 --> 20:01.120
and when we talk about software, then the solution must be free software. This is what we are

20:01.120 --> 20:07.920
trying basically in all of these fields by taking part in these consultations. This is also a call

20:07.920 --> 20:14.320
for your dear listeners to also take part in these consultations. So it's important that they

20:14.800 --> 20:20.320
that they see that there are a couple of voices out there that take care, so it definitely helps

20:20.320 --> 20:26.240
to take part in such consultations. You can find our feedback on the half your save portal

20:26.240 --> 20:32.960
of the European commission. If you put it in the show notes precisely, there you can read what we

20:32.960 --> 20:37.600
put there as a feedback, you can come up with a remix of this or you can find your own words,

20:37.600 --> 20:44.240
this is definitely helping in order to tell the commission that we do care, but also you

20:44.960 --> 20:50.400
support us with a donation so that we basically can do the work and that we can come up with these

20:51.440 --> 20:56.080
feedback to consultations, but that we are also able to travel to Brussels to talk to decision

20:56.080 --> 21:01.760
makers, or that we can go to these kinds of events like the summit for European digital serenity,

21:01.760 --> 21:06.880
so that we can take part. So this is how you can support us here. This is how you can help to make

21:06.960 --> 21:17.120
sure that the free software ecosystem in Europe is spreading and living well. So basically our work

21:17.120 --> 21:24.720
is to build the ground, so this means we educate decision makers, we tell them about our views,

21:24.720 --> 21:30.080
we are there to answer and address their questions they might have, but also to bring in our positions

21:30.960 --> 21:38.160
basically to fight for free software first policy. In all of these fields, also to try to connect

21:38.160 --> 21:43.840
these topics, so you also need to know that it's not always the same people working on this,

21:43.840 --> 21:51.600
and there are several director generals working on this, so DG, so the procurement reform is

21:51.600 --> 21:58.480
happening somewhere else, then the budget debate, then the digital decade policy program,

21:59.200 --> 22:05.200
other than the open source strategies, everything is handled by another DG, by another people,

22:05.200 --> 22:10.000
they need to be educated basically, they need to be connected, they need to see what their

22:10.000 --> 22:15.040
colleagues are doing, this is basically how we try to channel through these kind of debates,

22:15.040 --> 22:19.360
connecting people, trying to bring in our positions, fighting for these positions, finding

22:19.360 --> 22:25.760
majorities for these positions ultimately, and making sure that there is ultimately a free software

22:25.760 --> 22:31.920
first policy in all of these files. That sounds like a lot of work. It is, but it's also to be honest,

22:31.920 --> 22:39.200
something where we do make progress, it's small steps, that's for sure, but we do these small steps,

22:39.200 --> 22:48.560
we try to be around, and hopefully we will very soon see major steps and major progress and

22:48.720 --> 22:57.360
have an independent, well, basically not independent, but a solo rent, and the administration that can

22:57.360 --> 23:03.680
control its technology. What's your feeling when you talk to MPs from the European Parliament?

23:04.880 --> 23:10.000
Is there more understanding of what free software is than, like, let's say, five years ago,

23:10.960 --> 23:17.360
we put in a lot of work and effort into this, or what's your personal

23:18.560 --> 23:24.960
point of view here when you talk to the MPs, do they understand the arguments or how do they act?

23:26.720 --> 23:33.120
I mean, first of all, it really depends on the group you look at, but also in general,

23:33.200 --> 23:40.640
I would say the level of knowledge is rising, so that's definitely for sure, but also you can see

23:40.640 --> 23:47.200
that in the last term, for example, we had the AI Act, we had the Cyber-Resilience Act,

23:47.200 --> 23:52.320
so we had some very, very important, but also prominent files where free software played a role

23:52.320 --> 23:59.920
in these files. We actively worked on that, and at the end of the term, I'd say many MPs

23:59.920 --> 24:07.120
knew about it, many MPs understood our take, and that's why they also amended accordingly

24:07.120 --> 24:14.000
to these files to make sure that free software is protected, or that there is a dedicated

24:14.000 --> 24:21.280
wording on this in those files, but also after the elections, the European Parliament

24:21.280 --> 24:29.680
was dramatically changed, not only by majorities, but also many of these, one could say,

24:30.080 --> 24:37.520
than experts left the parliament, so for many, we had to start from scratch, we had to start to

24:37.520 --> 24:43.840
build new relationships, this is also still ongoing, and in particular, if you look at files like

24:43.840 --> 24:50.560
procurement, for example, right, so people working on these files are not digital experts, they are

24:51.920 --> 24:56.560
experts for procurement, if you like, and if you look at procurement, we talk about chairs,

24:56.560 --> 25:01.040
we talk about cars, we talk about whatever can be procured, and digital just plays

25:02.320 --> 25:09.280
one role next to many, many, many others, so you can't expect that you find digital experts

25:09.280 --> 25:13.520
in the field of procurement, for example, so we are coming up with completely new files

25:14.320 --> 25:21.920
this term, so that means we are running into new, so to say, networks of decision makers

25:21.920 --> 25:26.880
that need to be educated, so I wouldn't say we need to start from scratch, and I wouldn't say we

25:28.240 --> 25:34.560
it's worse than five years ago, still we need to educate people a lot, but what I can see in

25:34.560 --> 25:40.720
all of these meetings is that there is an interest in this, and that they are willing to understand,

25:40.720 --> 25:47.680
and that they also see more and more the benefits, why one should invest in free software,

25:47.760 --> 25:53.840
but also on the other side, which might be equally important, I'd say, is that we can get rid

25:53.840 --> 26:00.480
of some myths more and more, right, so often we have seen or we still often see the

26:00.480 --> 26:06.960
argument around security, for example, right, so if the code is transparent, then it's an issue

26:06.960 --> 26:12.320
for security, for example, so this is sometimes some of these myths which we are confronted with,

26:12.400 --> 26:17.920
and then we can educate people and tell people that's basically the opposite, it's true,

26:18.560 --> 26:26.720
and by thus, I do believe that we, after this term, will have way more experts in Europe

26:26.720 --> 26:32.720
coming from the procurement sector, for example, but also from budget debates, that also do

26:32.720 --> 26:38.560
understand that there is not only a budget argument to go in the direction of free software,

26:38.560 --> 26:44.400
but also so ran into security argument around it, and it's good that they see it, that they

26:44.400 --> 26:51.120
understand it, and that they listen to it, and I also do believe that we can get closer and

26:51.120 --> 26:57.760
closer and closer to this free software, first policy by convincing these people how far we can get,

26:57.760 --> 27:02.560
that's difficult to say at the moment, also often we see that there are still many, many

27:02.560 --> 27:09.760
loopholes in all of these initiatives, strategies, papers, so this is something what we try to fix,

27:09.760 --> 27:17.360
also with some creative ways, one could say, but here I do believe this is something which we,

27:18.800 --> 27:23.600
what we need to challenge for a very long time is to fix loopholes in all of this,

27:23.600 --> 27:30.480
so the lobbyists on the other side are also doing their job, they also try to maintain their

27:30.480 --> 27:39.520
business model for their proprietary software, and it's basically a fight for majorities,

27:39.520 --> 27:45.120
but I do believe it's way better than a couple of years ago, and that we already made progress

27:46.720 --> 27:51.600
not only the cyber resilience act, but also fights before like the copyright directive,

27:52.240 --> 27:58.960
and also our takes on the open source strategy in 2020, for example, we can see progress,

27:58.960 --> 28:06.000
we can see that more and more people take care, still in particular in this term we are addressing

28:06.000 --> 28:13.920
completely new networks, they need to have the skills of the digital-to-decade policy program in

28:13.920 --> 28:19.760
order to understand what's ongoing and why to pick free software and not a proprietary one.

28:21.760 --> 28:25.040
Is there something that is really outstanding to you in this conversation?

28:25.920 --> 28:36.080
I mean the outstanding is maybe a bit difficult, but what we hear very often is this

28:36.720 --> 28:44.000
bi-European or made in Europe approach, and here it's a bit difficult to make them understand

28:44.000 --> 28:50.160
that in particular free software is something global, right, and that they do not have to fear,

28:51.040 --> 28:57.440
that they also do not have to fear, that a line of code is coming outside of Europe,

28:57.440 --> 29:03.040
which is then in our infrastructure, for example, some of these kind of myths we are trying to

29:03.040 --> 29:10.720
address here, and that we are at the moment really often confronted with, and so I do believe it

29:10.720 --> 29:19.120
won't help us a lot in order to achieve this digital sovereignty to replace big tech by a European

29:19.120 --> 29:25.920
proprietary vendor and one or come up with another vendor login, right, so that won't help us.

29:26.480 --> 29:30.960
This is something which we need to address, where we need to educate, where we need to explain

29:30.960 --> 29:39.040
decision-makers a lot, and this is probably one of the strongest narratives we have to counter

29:39.040 --> 29:46.000
these days is that this bi-European or made in Europe argument doesn't make that much sense

29:46.560 --> 29:53.680
if you talk about free software and that this should not be the criteria, but rather the criteria

29:53.680 --> 29:58.800
should be that the software you are using has the four freedoms to use, study, share and improve,

29:59.360 --> 30:05.680
and then in this case it doesn't matter that much where the code is coming from, but you need to

30:05.680 --> 30:11.200
have the freedoms, which is way more important than where the code is coming from, so this is basically

30:11.200 --> 30:16.880
something which I see quite often these days, and where we definitely have to make sure that we

30:16.880 --> 30:23.680
can counter this narrative in the field of software. All right, is there something our listeners

30:23.680 --> 30:31.120
can do directly now after listening to this podcast? I mean definitely, so there are

30:31.840 --> 30:36.880
since the digital decade policy program consultation will be closed when you listen to it,

30:37.520 --> 30:42.880
but as I said, there is still the ongoing consultation on the procurement reform. We also

30:42.880 --> 30:47.600
contribute it to this. You can, to the first consultation on procurement, you can use this as a

30:47.600 --> 30:52.800
blueprint in order to contribute to the impact assessment consultation. We also had a podcast

30:52.800 --> 31:00.480
recording on this where you can re-listen our takes on that one. There is the consultation on the

31:01.360 --> 31:07.680
European Union open source strategy where you can and should feedback, so this is definitely

31:07.680 --> 31:13.360
something what you can do. You can, whenever you run into decision makers, tell them about the

31:13.360 --> 31:19.840
benefits of the software, so help us with spreading the good news about the software, so this is also

31:19.840 --> 31:26.320
something which is super helpful. Use your social media channels to promote best practice,

31:26.320 --> 31:31.040
to promote our podcasts, for example, and ultimately, as also said in the beginning,

31:31.040 --> 31:37.520
you can join us as a supporter, for example, and help us that we can do our work. Go to conferences,

31:37.520 --> 31:43.920
spread the word, spread the good news, take part in these processes, listen to the podcast,

31:43.920 --> 31:52.400
so this is also something where we normally refer to ongoing activities where you can and might

31:52.560 --> 31:57.760
want to take part. So this is definitely, everything is helpful. Also, if you are a member states,

31:57.760 --> 32:04.240
it's super helpful. If you try to talk to your local and national decision makers,

32:05.200 --> 32:11.680
as said, often these initiatives in Europe are only happening because of the willingness of

32:11.680 --> 32:18.160
member states and the more member states we have around the more progress we can do. So this

32:18.240 --> 32:22.800
is definitely also helping if you are active in member states, so you don't have to go to Brussels

32:22.800 --> 32:29.440
to fight for a free software, you can also do this in your hometown. Yeah. I do have a person

32:29.440 --> 32:36.400
that I'm also sometimes in contact with decision makers. At the Congress, I received a postcard

32:36.400 --> 32:44.320
that said, thank you so much for your energy and your support of free software, and it was a

32:44.320 --> 32:49.840
very nice postcard that I received, and I have to be thinking that decision makers are also not all

32:49.840 --> 32:57.120
of them, all of them, because I mean, not everybody can be on the same page, but it's also very nice.

32:59.360 --> 33:05.200
Absolutely, yeah, this is very encouraging. Yeah, that's the word I was looking for. I found

33:05.200 --> 33:11.440
this was a very good story, and listeners, if you know any decision maker, maybe at the next

33:11.520 --> 33:24.560
Congress, you might receive such a postcard. So yeah, with this, I would say we put in all the links

33:24.560 --> 33:30.320
in the show notes, you find our feedback there, go through our feedback, take this as a blueprint,

33:30.320 --> 33:36.400
as Alex already proposed, and yeah, talk to your decision makers on a local level, on a member

33:36.400 --> 33:43.680
state level of the European Union, or also contact your MEPs in the European Parliament,

33:43.680 --> 33:50.240
and tell them how important free software is, and yeah, let us bring free software forward,

33:50.240 --> 33:55.120
and support us also with the nation, if you can, so we can do the work for you as well.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.320
Alex, do you have anything to add?

34:01.040 --> 34:04.400
No, no, do so.

34:07.040 --> 34:10.880
Thank you so much for taking us through the digital decade policy program.

34:11.600 --> 34:16.480
I mean, it's supposed to be running for the next decade, so let's see what's happening there.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.640
I'm quite sure you will follow up on it, right?

34:19.680 --> 34:21.040
Yes, yes, absolutely.

34:21.040 --> 34:24.800
Thank you for also doing this podcast, as you have said many times before.

34:25.040 --> 34:29.600
And yeah, thank you so much for being here.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.280
Thank you so much for your time.

34:31.280 --> 34:31.680
Thank you.

34:32.960 --> 34:36.640
Thank you, listeners, for listening to our software freedom podcast.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.520
and its impact on our digital lives.

34:50.480 --> 34:54.320
This podcast is presented to you by the free software foundation, Europe.

34:55.120 --> 34:58.320

Thank you so much.

35:10.720 --> 35:11.200
Bye bye.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.720
Hi, my name is Eric Da Silva.

35:14.720 --> 35:19.520
How I got to fsafi is what's very passionate about digital rights.

35:19.520 --> 35:23.440
For the reason why I'm staying at fsafi, I've been staying around since my

35:23.440 --> 35:26.480
internship is because it's a very nice organization.

35:26.480 --> 35:33.840
It's for very kind people who are very committed to what we're doing and are very sensitive to

35:35.840 --> 35:38.240
the importance of political issues.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.480
But for human aspect, it's very important for me.
