    <p>
      The <a href="http://www.wipo.org">World Intellectual Property
        Organization (WIPO)</a> is one of the 16 specialized agencies of the
      <a href="http://www.un.org">United Nations</a> system of organisations.
      Its role is administrating 23 international treates dealing with
      different aspects of limited monopolies on knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to its own <a href="http://www.wipo.org">web page</a>, it is
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      <em>
        "an international organization dedicated to promoting the use and
        protection of works of the human spirit. These works -- intellectual
        property -- are expanding the bounds of science and technology and
        enriching the world of the arts. Through its work, WIPO plays an
        important role in enhancing the quality and enjoyment of life, as well
        as creating real wealth for nations."
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      As explained in articles such as
      "<a href="/activities/wsis/issues.en.html">Fighting intellectual
        poverty</a>" or "<a href="/activities/wipo/iprip.en.html">On 'Intellectual
        Property' and Indigenous Peoples</a>" on FSFEs web page -- as well as
      many others on the net -- the statement above did not match reality in the past. The
      <a href="http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/genevadeclaration.html">Geneva
        Declaration</a> states clearly how in the past WIPO has had a history of
      "intellectually weak, ideologically rigid, and sometimes brutally
      unfair and inefficient policies."
    </p>

    <p>
      For anyone involved in questions of freedom in a digital age, such as
      Free Software Foundation Europe, WIPO is often at the root of current
      threats, such as <a href="/activities/swpat/">software patents</a>, the
      <a href="/activities/eucd/">European Copyright Directive (EUCD)</a> and
      others. When these come to a European or national level, we often find
      that little room for change exists.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of reacting to legislative projects individually when they are
      passed down, Free Software Foundation Europe is proactively
      facilitating more useful legislation at its root, the
      global level, in which WIPO is one key player. For that reason,
      FSFE has requested observer status to WIPO in 2003, which was
      granted during the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO from
      September 27 to October 5, 2004.
    </p> 

    <p>
      Together with a global coalition of other players with similar goals,
      FSFE will work to change the "World Intellectual Property Organization"
      into a "<a href="/activities/wipo/wiwo.html">World Intellectual Wealth
        Organisation</a>."
    </p>
