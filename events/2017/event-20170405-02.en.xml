			<p>IT-tinkering is only possible with Free Software, that's why FSFE is going to be present with an information and merchandise booth on MAKER FAIR BERLIN at the weekend of 10th and 11th of June 2017. On Saturday, MAKER FAIR is open for school classes and their teachers, free of charge. 
			MAKER FAIR is a come-together of makers and visitors interested in various DIY-ideas. 
			At FSFE’s booth, visitors can inform themselves about Raspberry Pi as a computer for standard applications especially suitable for education, about how to ‘free’ Android-Smartphones and about email-encryption.</p>
