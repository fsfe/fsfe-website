      <p>üëâ What will we talk about?</p>
     <p>    What is "I Love Free Software Day"?<br/>
    Why is it important to show appreciation in the Free Software community?<br/>
    How can you actively participate in the campaign and celebrate your favorite projects or contributors with creative and positive messages or by organizing a dedicated event?<br/>
    Two testimonials from people who have already organized events for the campaign:<br/>
        A company-focused event.<br/>
        A public event.<br/>
        We'll hear about their experiences, what inspired them, and the results they achieved.</p>
     <p>In our community, we often report bugs, request new features, and provide feedback on Free Software projects, but it's equally important to take a moment to say Thank You to those who selflessly work for all of us.</p>
     <p>‚ù§Ô∏è Join us to discover how we can make February 14th a special day for the Free Software community!</p>
