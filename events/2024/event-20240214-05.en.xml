      <p>Xavier de Blas in the mid-2000s gave 111 lectures-show on free software. Upon reaching this number, he decided to reorient his efforts to programming. For the “I ♥️ Free Software Day” 2024 he will discuss some fun anecdotes of that time and offer us a new small format show called “ManipulaSo” where he will play with sensors and free software and hardware tools that he develops daily.</p>
      <p>Please note, that the presentation about Free Software will be held in Spanish.</p>
