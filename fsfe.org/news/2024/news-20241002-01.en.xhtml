<h1>Premiere of the "Ada &amp; Zangemann" movie on Ada Lovelace Day</h1>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is celebrating Ada Lovelace 
Day on October 8 with a special event for its supporters: the global 
English premiere of the animated film <strong>'Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of 
Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream'</strong>. Originally a highly 
successful illustrated book, now available in 10 languages and counting, 
the story has been adapted into a film and is licensed as an open 
educational resource.

<p>Following the success of the illustrated book ‘Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of 
Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream’,  
the FSFE is now releasing the story as an animated movie. The book is 
currently available in 10 languages and has reached the hands of over 
20,000 children worldwide and it was been spread through readings, 
discussions, and workshops.</p>

<p>The movie, available under a Creative Commons license, is about the 
famous and immensely rich inventor Zangemann and the girl Ada, a 
curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment with hardware and software 
and, due to Zangemann’s actions, realises how crucial technology is for 
her and others. It is a fascinating story for children from the age of 6 
that will motivate them to tinker with hardware and software, and 
encourage
them to actively shape their own technology.</p>

<h3>‘Ada &amp; Zangemann’, the movie premiere</h3> 

<p>The premiere of the English movie will take place on 
Ada Lovelace Day through a global online event. FSFE supporters, the 
donors who made this movie possible, and members of various Free 
Software associations will be present. Vint Cerf, often referred 
to as one of the "fathers of the Internet", and Franziska Heine, 
Executive Director of Wikimedia Germany, will give special speeches 
during the event.</p>
