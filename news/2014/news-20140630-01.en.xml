    <title>[Blog] Translations of FSF's email self-defence now available</title>
	<body>

    <p>Today our sister organisation, the FSF, published their e-mail self
      defence guide and their infographic in 6 new languages. It is now
      available in English, German, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Russian,
      Turkish, and Japanese. They explain the installation of the necessary
      programs for e-mail encryption under GNU/Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft
      Windows; the key generation; the web of trust; as well as the usage of
      those programs. All you need is a computer with an Internet connection,
      an email account, and about half an hour. Please give us feedback, so we
      can include that before printing the infographics, and help us to spread
      them.</p>
