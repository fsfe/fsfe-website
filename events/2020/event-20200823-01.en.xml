    <title>FrOSCon talk: the core values of software freedom in Bonn, Germany</title>

    <body>
      <p>Matthias Kirschner, President of the FSFE, will talk about &quot;The core values of software freedom&quot; (in German) at FrOSCon. This year the event will take place remotely. Kirschner will argue that the core values of our movement are that everybody, no matter what background, can use the software for every purpose without discrimination. That everybody is allowed to study how software works. That you are always allowed to share your software with others, either to help other human beings or to make money. And that no individual, organisation or government should be forced to change their behaviour because of the software. Instead, according to our principles, they should be allowed to adapt and thereby improve the software for themselves and others. The talk and discussion will take place from 10:00 - 11:00 CEST.</p>
