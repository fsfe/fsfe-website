<h2>About the FSFE</h2>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users 
to control technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of 
our lives and it is important that technology empowers rather than 
restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use,  
understand, adapt, and share software. These rights help support other 
fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press, and privacy.</p> 

<p>The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free 
Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination. 
It enhances users' rights by abolishing  barriers to Free Software  
adoption, encourages people to use and  develop Free Software, and  
provides resources to enable everyone to further promote Free Software 
in Europe.</p> 

<p>We are involved in many activities in the legal, economic, political 
and technical areas around Free Software. Our work is made possible by 
a community of volunteers, supporters, donors, and staff.</p>
