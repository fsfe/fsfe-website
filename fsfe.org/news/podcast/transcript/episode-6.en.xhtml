Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:16.760 --&gt; 00:20.520
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:20.520 --&gt; 00:23.520
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:23.520 --&gt; 00:27.560
I'm Matthias Kirschner, and the President of the Free Software Foundation Europe, and

00:27.560 --&gt; 00:30.640
I'm doing this podcast together with my colleague Bonnie Mehring.

00:30.640 --&gt; 00:31.640
Hello.

00:31.640 --&gt; 00:35.440
In this episode, we will talk about copyright enforcement in Free Software.

00:35.440 --&gt; 00:37.440
Our guest is Miriam Bahlhausen.

00:37.440 --&gt; 00:42.520
Miriam Bahlhausen is a German lawyer with the focus on Free Software, data protection

00:42.520 --&gt; 00:43.520
and copyright law.

00:43.520 --&gt; 00:47.800
She's also specialized in Free Software copyright questions.

00:47.800 --&gt; 00:48.800
Hello.

00:48.800 --&gt; 00:49.800
Hello, Miriam.

00:49.800 --&gt; 00:50.800
Good to have you here.

00:50.800 --&gt; 00:55.560
Miriam, can you start to explain how is copyright enforcement free software?

00:55.560 --&gt; 00:59.080
The question for me actually wouldn't be how is copyright enforced in Free Software,

00:59.080 --&gt; 01:03.120
but rather how is copyright enforced in software in general, because Free Software is just

01:03.120 --&gt; 01:09.400
for me as a lawyer, just one aspect of software, and therefore forcing copyrights in Free

01:09.400 --&gt; 01:10.400
Software.

01:10.400 --&gt; 01:12.920
It's just one aspect of enforcement in general.

01:12.920 --&gt; 01:18.800
Chesa, a short question, but what is copyright in general, and what is a license?

01:18.800 --&gt; 01:23.920
So copyright and a license, that's not for me, not really the same thing.

01:23.920 --&gt; 01:30.080
So copyright is just the right in the software, that the author or the employer or someone

01:30.080 --&gt; 01:35.800
who they transferred the copyright to has an interest in has a right in.

01:35.800 --&gt; 01:42.320
The license is really just granting rights to someone else, allowing them to use a software

01:42.320 --&gt; 01:44.360
that I program, for example.

01:44.360 --&gt; 01:49.200
So if I write software and I want Matthias to use this software, I give him a license,

01:49.200 --&gt; 01:51.200
but I am the copyright holder.

01:51.840 --&gt; 01:58.280
Okay, so copyright stays by the person that has the rights over the software and a license

01:58.280 --&gt; 02:00.680
provides the rights to somebody else.

02:00.680 --&gt; 02:02.840
Yes, exactly.

02:02.840 --&gt; 02:07.800
So in Free Software and the license, you always make sure that you transfer the rights or

02:07.800 --&gt; 02:11.280
the freedoms to you study, share and improve the software.

02:11.280 --&gt; 02:13.640
That's the difference to proprietary software.

02:13.640 --&gt; 02:18.520
If one of those freedoms is missing, it's not free software, it's proprietary software.

02:18.640 --&gt; 02:21.960
Yes, that's how I would generally differentiate that, yes.

02:21.960 --&gt; 02:27.120
So why would you now have to enforce a license?

02:28.120 --&gt; 02:33.720
Well, so it may happen that, you know, you license your software under a free software

02:33.720 --&gt; 02:38.000
license or under, you know, a copyright license just in general.

02:38.000 --&gt; 02:42.160
And then whoever you're licensing the software to is using your software,

02:42.160 --&gt; 02:44.040
but they don't comply with the license.

02:44.040 --&gt; 02:48.960
Now that may happen under proprietary licenses, just as much as under free software licenses.

02:48.960 --&gt; 02:54.280
So if you tell them you need to provide, let's say, the license text and they don't,

02:54.280 --&gt; 02:58.920
then they infringe your rights because they don't comply with the license that you were

02:58.920 --&gt; 03:00.160
giving them.

03:00.160 --&gt; 03:02.800
And you know, you may not be happy with that.

03:02.800 --&gt; 03:07.000
And in a case like that, you may want to enforce your rights, not so much because you don't

03:07.000 --&gt; 03:09.320
want to allow them to use your software.

03:09.320 --&gt; 03:12.760
You just granted them very broad rights, right?

03:12.760 --&gt; 03:15.960
But you may want to make sure that they actually comply with the license.

03:15.960 --&gt; 03:19.960
So under these circumstances, it may become relevant that you, you know, enforce your rights

03:19.960 --&gt; 03:26.880
in your copyrights in the software and through that enforce their compliance with the license

03:26.880 --&gt; 03:28.040
text.

03:28.040 --&gt; 03:33.000
Could you give an example how a copyright license could be infringed?

03:33.000 --&gt; 03:35.360
Well, that would be, like I just said, that would be one example.

03:35.360 --&gt; 03:40.120
So they use your software, they include it in a product, the product is distributed,

03:40.120 --&gt; 03:45.720
but there's no license text provided with the product or the source code is missing,

03:45.720 --&gt; 03:46.720
for example.

03:46.720 --&gt; 03:51.640
Or, you know, they don't provide the copyright notices, for example, you know, all of

03:51.640 --&gt; 03:56.800
these could be just infringements that happen quite a lot in practice.

03:56.800 --&gt; 04:02.120
And what are the typical examples for free software specifically, how the software licenses

04:02.120 --&gt; 04:03.440
are infringed?

04:03.440 --&gt; 04:05.400
These are the examples for free software.

04:05.400 --&gt; 04:09.680
So if you're talking proprietary, it's usually more that they are overusing.

04:09.680 --&gt; 04:15.960
So there are more users actually assigned to a software that, you know, the license allows

04:15.960 --&gt; 04:16.960
for.

04:16.960 --&gt; 04:21.160
You're actually using it as software as a service, although you only have like an on-premise

04:21.160 --&gt; 04:22.600
license or something like that.

04:22.600 --&gt; 04:27.800
So that would be examples for proprietary licenses.

04:27.800 --&gt; 04:32.040
Source code missing, license text missing, copyright notices missing, those are the typical

04:32.040 --&gt; 04:36.280
examples for free software infringements or free software license infringements.

04:36.280 --&gt; 04:40.400
What do you mean by license text is missing?

04:40.400 --&gt; 04:45.720
So there would be a case where the product or documentation that's provided with the

04:45.720 --&gt; 04:50.880
product, for example, says, well, this product includes software that's licensed under

04:50.880 --&gt; 04:57.360
the GPL and then there's a link, but you wouldn't have direct access to the full license text.

04:57.360 --&gt; 05:00.440
So you wouldn't get a copy of the full license text.

05:00.440 --&gt; 05:05.360
And therefore, or the reason why that is an issue is because then the user doesn't really

05:05.360 --&gt; 05:08.600
know that they have very extensive rights in their software.

05:08.600 --&gt; 05:13.360
So that's usually the way that is argued or why that becomes an issue.

05:13.360 --&gt; 05:17.720
So if you take the example that there's a free software programmer and she wrote a cool

05:17.720 --&gt; 05:24.200
piece of software and that's then reused by some company in their products and then she

05:24.200 --&gt; 05:29.120
finds out that they are shipping the software in their products, but they don't provide

05:29.120 --&gt; 05:34.360
any license text and thereby people don't know that she wanted other people around the

05:34.360 --&gt; 05:39.280
world to also use study, share and improve the software she wrote.

05:39.280 --&gt; 05:40.480
What can she do then?

05:40.480 --&gt; 05:47.360
Well, so the way it works is because the licenses say you as licensee need to comply with

05:47.360 --&gt; 05:49.320
these and these and these and these requirements.

05:49.320 --&gt; 05:54.080
For example, provide the license text and then goes on to say, and if you don't, you lose

05:54.080 --&gt; 05:56.960
your right in the use of the software.

05:56.960 --&gt; 06:02.880
You then have a copyright infringement because the rights that are initially granted under

06:02.880 --&gt; 06:08.240
the free software license fall apart the moment that a company, for example, doesn't comply

06:08.240 --&gt; 06:10.120
with the license text.

06:10.120 --&gt; 06:14.400
And because you have a copyright infringement, you actually have all the rights that are

06:14.400 --&gt; 06:22.520
available to all copyright holders under the copyright laws that apply to use specifically.

06:22.520 --&gt; 06:25.200
For Germany, of course, that's a German copyright act.

06:25.200 --&gt; 06:29.720
And under the German Copyright Act, you have a right to cease and desist, a right to

06:29.720 --&gt; 06:33.080
claim them, you know, they need to stop doing what they are doing.

06:33.080 --&gt; 06:40.440
They need to provide the license text and for example, damages in cases as well.

06:40.440 --&gt; 06:42.880
You mentioned cease and desist letter.

06:42.880 --&gt; 06:46.520
What is this exactly and how does it look?

06:46.520 --&gt; 06:53.840
So a cease and desist letter is at least for Germany the first step in proceedings to

06:53.840 --&gt; 06:56.920
enforce your rights in software.

06:56.920 --&gt; 07:01.320
What you need to do, for example, to avoid costs is send out the cease and desist letter

07:01.320 --&gt; 07:04.800
that essentially says, hey, you're using my software.

07:04.800 --&gt; 07:08.880
I'm granting broad rights to this software to you.

07:08.880 --&gt; 07:14.120
But I also ask that you comply with these and these and these requirements.

07:14.120 --&gt; 07:17.040
And if you don't, you know, you're actually infringing my copyrights.

07:17.040 --&gt; 07:19.400
I want you to stop doing that.

07:19.400 --&gt; 07:25.800
And I also want you to stop doing that going forward whenever you continue to use my software.

07:25.800 --&gt; 07:31.840
So it's really like a formal letter asking someone else to stop the license infringement

07:31.840 --&gt; 07:34.160
and therefore the copyright infringement.

07:34.160 --&gt; 07:40.440
For example, many years ago, I then got a call here in the office from a company, oh,

07:40.440 --&gt; 07:46.800
we got a letter here from someone called Harold Welter and he writes that we cannot use

07:46.800 --&gt; 07:49.520
free software the way we did here.

07:49.520 --&gt; 07:50.520
What is this about?

07:50.520 --&gt; 07:55.320
And in the letter says something about we have two public source code and provide a license

07:55.320 --&gt; 07:56.320
text.

07:56.320 --&gt; 07:58.120
So that's what you were describing here.

07:58.120 --&gt; 07:59.120
Yes, exactly.

07:59.120 --&gt; 08:03.320
Can you explain how that worked in practice in Germany then?

08:03.320 --&gt; 08:09.480
I mean, are there many, many cases around Europe about enforcing free software licenses

08:09.480 --&gt; 08:13.600
or how does it usually happen?

08:13.600 --&gt; 08:18.680
Well, around Europe, not so much in Germany, yes, there are quite a few cases.

08:18.680 --&gt; 08:25.200
Of course, if you're not working for the right holders, you can't really tell how many

08:25.200 --&gt; 08:27.720
cases there are exactly.

08:27.720 --&gt; 08:33.760
But as an average, if you look at just the file numbers that those actually enforcing their

08:33.760 --&gt; 08:39.120
rights in free software are using, you can tell that there's an average between, let's

08:39.120 --&gt; 08:45.360
say, five to 10 cases per month, which means, you know, obviously, around about a hundred

08:45.360 --&gt; 08:48.240
to 120 cases per year.

08:48.240 --&gt; 08:50.520
Not all of these cases actually end up in court.

08:50.520 --&gt; 08:54.520
There's a lot of, like, out of court enforcement as well, which is, you know, just the season

08:54.520 --&gt; 08:55.520
to sister letter.

08:55.520 --&gt; 09:01.080
And then you handle that out of court by settlement, you know, whatever way is available.

09:01.080 --&gt; 09:04.760
But that's about the number that we're talking about for Germany, yeah.

09:04.760 --&gt; 09:09.960
In the past, I mean, the FSFE also worked with Harold Welton, GPL violations, to make

09:09.960 --&gt; 09:12.720
sure that free software licenses are enforced.

09:12.720 --&gt; 09:18.680
And there's also around the world, there's the software freedom, conservancy, net filter,

09:18.680 --&gt; 09:23.680
and the FSF who were doing this kind of license enforcement, where there are any others who

09:23.680 --&gt; 09:24.840
are doing this.

09:24.840 --&gt; 09:32.160
Well, right now, we have, of course, someone else in Germany who's, you know, often enforcing

09:32.160 --&gt; 09:33.400
their rights.

09:33.400 --&gt; 09:37.240
But apart from that, you know, there are individual cases around the world.

09:37.240 --&gt; 09:42.320
I think Israel, there were a few, you know, there were just a few cases, but it's not that

09:42.320 --&gt; 09:45.400
much compared to what we're seeing in Germany.

09:45.400 --&gt; 09:49.160
There's just a lot more happening here.

09:49.160 --&gt; 09:52.840
Why is copyright in FSF so often enforced in Germany?

09:52.840 --&gt; 10:00.960
Well, I think it's because the German Copyright Act is just really favorable to rightholders

10:00.960 --&gt; 10:08.080
and the measures that are available to rightholders are just, you know, easily handled by them,

10:08.080 --&gt; 10:12.000
or they are just easily accessible to rightholders.

10:12.000 --&gt; 10:17.560
Furthermore, you have strict rules on the costs.

10:17.560 --&gt; 10:23.400
So in Germany, lawyers are not allowed to undercharge, but they are also, you know, strictly

10:23.400 --&gt; 10:26.000
regulated what they can actually charge.

10:26.000 --&gt; 10:31.680
And there's a statutory fee that you need to pay that is actually calculated on, based

10:31.680 --&gt; 10:35.360
on the worth of the case, you know, there's a lot of rules around that.

10:35.360 --&gt; 10:42.280
But what I mean to say is, you know, upfront, what this will cost you if you lose the case,

10:42.280 --&gt; 10:45.720
which is really the only scenario that you need to be worried about.

10:45.720 --&gt; 10:50.040
So if you start enforcing your rights, you know, well, if this goes badly for me, this

10:50.040 --&gt; 10:51.800
is what it will cost me.

10:51.800 --&gt; 10:57.480
But this is also exactly what I will make if I actually win this case.

10:57.480 --&gt; 11:01.640
That's one thing why taking risk is actually why there's actually not so much of a risk

11:01.640 --&gt; 11:04.800
if you start enforcing your rights as a rightholder.

11:04.800 --&gt; 11:10.640
Then additionally, if you go and send out a seasoned assist letter, there's a second step

11:10.640 --&gt; 11:13.960
where you can ask for a preliminary injunction.

11:13.960 --&gt; 11:19.200
So you send out the seasoned assist letter, you give the infringer a very short deadline

11:19.200 --&gt; 11:21.000
to reply to this seasoned assist letter.

11:21.000 --&gt; 11:25.840
If you don't hear back from them, you can actually claim this preliminary injunction.

11:25.840 --&gt; 11:32.840
If you're lucky as a as a rightholder, this injunction gets granted within days, sometimes

11:32.840 --&gt; 11:39.080
within hours, depends on how bad this case is or how, you know, what kind of stands the

11:39.080 --&gt; 11:42.080
court takes on this.

11:42.080 --&gt; 11:46.760
And then, you know, once this preliminary injunction is granted, that is sent to the infringer

11:46.760 --&gt; 11:50.920
and they actually need to stop distributing their products immediately.

11:50.920 --&gt; 11:56.240
So if you're a big company using free software, allegedly infringing these rights, you're

11:56.240 --&gt; 12:02.400
immediately facing the risk of having to stop distributing your products, right?

12:02.400 --&gt; 12:05.920
And of course, that's something you would not want to happen.

12:05.920 --&gt; 12:09.960
And with that in mind, it just, you know, makes it rather easy for the infringer to enforce

12:09.960 --&gt; 12:15.800
their rights because they always have this threat, you could call it at times, where they

12:15.800 --&gt; 12:19.920
can easily, you know, tell you, this is what I want you to do.

12:19.920 --&gt; 12:23.640
And if you don't, I get this preliminary injunction, you need to stop distributing your

12:23.640 --&gt; 12:24.640
products.

12:24.640 --&gt; 12:31.520
A lot of companies, they are, of course, very upset if they realize that they have such

12:31.520 --&gt; 12:35.720
a problem in their products because I mean, free software is meanwhile used in so many

12:35.720 --&gt; 12:37.560
products around the world.

12:37.560 --&gt; 12:43.480
And when you as a company, you distribute many products, including, including software

12:43.480 --&gt; 12:46.280
and free software license.

12:46.280 --&gt; 12:51.600
So when they receive such a season, this is letter that can mean that they are in huge

12:51.600 --&gt; 12:52.760
trouble.

12:52.760 --&gt; 13:01.360
And in the, in the recent months, I also experienced that some of them had the feeling that a license

13:01.360 --&gt; 13:05.960
enforcement in free software became way more aggressive.

13:05.960 --&gt; 13:11.880
And so my question is, I mean, you, you have also seen like how a hard value with GPL violations

13:11.880 --&gt; 13:18.520
has enforced free software in the past, is there now, is that now done differently?

13:18.520 --&gt; 13:23.320
Well, I think it depends on the exact case at hand and it sometimes also depends on the

13:23.320 --&gt; 13:27.200
month that you received the season to assist letter, really.

13:27.200 --&gt; 13:33.480
I think at least from, from what I understand, you know, it's now become more aggressive

13:33.480 --&gt; 13:41.840
in a way that the focus is more on making money out of it and less on making sure

13:42.840 --&gt; 13:47.640
the company, the licensee really complies with the license.

13:47.640 --&gt; 13:51.480
And that of course shifts how you negotiate, for example, a settlement, right?

13:51.480 --&gt; 13:57.760
If you're really focused on enforcement, things like, you know, we'll have a settlement

13:57.760 --&gt; 14:01.960
that actually gives the company a little bit time, a little bit more time to become compliant

14:01.960 --&gt; 14:04.960
if you really feel they have an interest in that.

14:04.960 --&gt; 14:09.480
And you know, there's constraints that they may not be able to work around immediately,

14:09.480 --&gt; 14:13.160
but they will want to work towards that.

14:13.160 --&gt; 14:18.120
There's obviously a different negotiation going on than compared to a case where you really

14:18.120 --&gt; 14:23.360
just want to make as much money out of this as you possibly can, then you may not want

14:23.360 --&gt; 14:28.400
to reveal such constraints and you know, you cannot really find a workaround around situation

14:28.400 --&gt; 14:29.400
like that.

14:29.400 --&gt; 14:31.280
So yeah, that's the difference I see.

14:31.280 --&gt; 14:36.120
But as I said, you know, there have been cases on both ends, even with the enforcement

14:36.120 --&gt; 14:37.800
going on right now.

14:38.760 --&gt; 14:43.280
So I mean, as one response, also some free software organizations, including our sister

14:43.280 --&gt; 14:49.480
organization, the FSF in the US, they formulated some policies how to do free software license

14:49.480 --&gt; 14:52.040
compliance in a community-friendly way.

14:52.040 --&gt; 14:57.240
So would you say that this is something which was needed because it was actually not done

14:57.240 --&gt; 14:58.240
that way before?

14:58.240 --&gt; 14:59.240
Yes.

14:59.240 --&gt; 15:03.960
Yes, in my opinion, that actually did make sense because I mean, I don't know if it

15:03.960 --&gt; 15:10.280
is ever going to help in court, but at least it lays down rules how you would want that

15:10.280 --&gt; 15:11.640
to be done.

15:11.640 --&gt; 15:16.400
And you could at least theoretically point out, well, the way this enforcement is done

15:16.400 --&gt; 15:20.680
is actually not how these licenses were supposed to be enforced, right?

15:20.680 --&gt; 15:25.440
Like I said, I'm not sure that would actually give you as a company illegal argument against

15:25.440 --&gt; 15:29.680
such enforcement if that ever happens in court, but at least there's something available

15:29.680 --&gt; 15:31.560
that you could point to.

15:31.560 --&gt; 15:35.080
So those guidelines are also legally binding.

15:35.080 --&gt; 15:39.040
Well, but just for those who actually signed them, right?

15:39.040 --&gt; 15:44.840
If those enforcing the rights did not sign them, did not agree to them, I would personally

15:44.840 --&gt; 15:50.240
say there's probably little you can do, like strictly legal that you can do with these

15:50.240 --&gt; 15:54.840
guidelines, but it's of course good to have such guidelines because otherwise you really

15:54.840 --&gt; 15:59.960
have no documentation how everyone else would want the enforcement to be done, right?

15:59.960 --&gt; 16:04.760
And you can't really argue, well, this is the outlier here, and this way of enforcement

16:04.760 --&gt; 16:09.040
is really not community friendly and the rest of the community does not like this.

16:09.040 --&gt; 16:11.960
From that perspective, I think it's good.

16:11.960 --&gt; 16:14.640
The other part, of course, is there as well, right?

16:14.640 --&gt; 16:16.960
It's not a strictly legal argument.

16:16.960 --&gt; 16:21.320
Looking back a little bit of what we talked about the last minutes, you could get impression

16:21.320 --&gt; 16:26.200
that being compliant with free software licenses is very complicated.

16:26.200 --&gt; 16:28.520
What would you reply to this?

16:28.520 --&gt; 16:32.640
It is, if you start looking at it only at the end, when you actually want to go to market

16:32.640 --&gt; 16:38.760
with your product, if you have processes in place and actually make sure everyone within

16:38.760 --&gt; 16:43.160
your company is, or everyone at least working with the software within your company is

16:43.160 --&gt; 16:49.920
aware of what free software means, I have a feeling it is actually not all that hard.

16:49.920 --&gt; 16:55.760
And even more broadly speaking, there's always the way to make the source code available,

16:55.760 --&gt; 16:56.760
right?

16:56.760 --&gt; 17:02.280
If you do that, I think it actually becomes a lot less hard than what you would say,

17:02.280 --&gt; 17:04.440
you know, if you're trying to find workarounds.

17:04.440 --&gt; 17:10.320
So that means that if it's just complicated, if you do not want to directly publish the

17:10.320 --&gt; 17:15.080
source code, at least it becomes a lot harder, right?

17:15.080 --&gt; 17:18.320
Because you need to make sure, you know, what are the applicable licenses?

17:18.320 --&gt; 17:22.800
So you need to look a lot closer than saying, okay, this is the source code I received,

17:22.800 --&gt; 17:26.640
this is what I'm working with, this is what I need to make sure I make available with

17:26.680 --&gt; 17:28.280
the product at the end.

17:28.280 --&gt; 17:33.000
Of course, fully understood, there are, you know, products where making the source code

17:33.000 --&gt; 17:39.480
available may be a lot harder, especially given that you can't simply link to the source

17:39.480 --&gt; 17:41.520
code under most licenses, right?

17:41.520 --&gt; 17:46.000
So if you have a product, a physical product, and the source code needs to be on there

17:46.000 --&gt; 17:53.320
in addition to whatever else you need on your product, that may actually be a challenge.

17:53.320 --&gt; 17:59.320
What are the steps to make sure that you don't infringe the free software license?

17:59.320 --&gt; 18:04.520
First of all, you need to know what software you're actually using.

18:04.520 --&gt; 18:09.160
And to be honest, that is often, at least, you know, when working with companies, that's

18:09.160 --&gt; 18:13.400
often the biggest challenge, because you have so many, you know, individual developers

18:13.400 --&gt; 18:16.360
working on the software or even teams, right?

18:16.360 --&gt; 18:19.560
And you can't really know what is in there.

18:19.600 --&gt; 18:24.760
And of course, you know, they try things, they include software and you don't know what

18:24.760 --&gt; 18:27.400
licenses apply to the software.

18:27.400 --&gt; 18:32.400
That is, in my opinion, the key step to make sure you have a process where you actually

18:32.400 --&gt; 18:35.800
know what the software is that goes in there.

18:35.800 --&gt; 18:39.160
And once you know what you have in there, of course, you need to identify, you know, what

18:39.160 --&gt; 18:45.200
are the different license requirements, license obligations that you need to, you know,

18:45.240 --&gt; 18:49.680
look out for, but really, that is a second step.

18:49.680 --&gt; 18:55.640
And at least from my perspective, not that hard, once you really know what you're using

18:55.640 --&gt; 18:57.280
within your product.

18:57.280 --&gt; 19:00.920
And then the second thing is really mostly about the process.

19:00.920 --&gt; 19:02.520
Make sure you know what it is.

19:02.520 --&gt; 19:08.320
Make sure you identify the license obligations and make sure you have a process in place.

19:08.320 --&gt; 19:12.760
How you would want to comply with these obligations, you know, do you want to provide the source

19:12.760 --&gt; 19:13.760
code?

19:13.760 --&gt; 19:14.960
Is it not possible?

19:14.960 --&gt; 19:19.440
And then you need to maybe find a workaround to still make sure you're 100% compliant.

19:19.440 --&gt; 19:23.960
Yeah, that's really often a case-by-case decision on what works for the company and often

19:23.960 --&gt; 19:30.400
even within companies, a decision, you know, from product to product because different

19:30.400 --&gt; 19:34.480
products may just need to do this differently.

19:34.480 --&gt; 19:40.040
We have this nice tool called Reuse, which adds a little header with all the licensing and

19:40.040 --&gt; 19:42.360
copyright information to the software parts.

19:42.360 --&gt; 19:44.840
Do you think this could actually help with this?

19:44.840 --&gt; 19:51.400
Well, as I said, the most important step is mostly to find out what licenses apply.

19:51.400 --&gt; 19:59.880
And in practice, finding that out is often hard because there's no standard way of quoting

19:59.880 --&gt; 20:03.200
these licenses or referring to these licenses.

20:03.200 --&gt; 20:09.640
So unless you're really going through all the texts manually, which is not possible, in

20:09.680 --&gt; 20:15.800
most cases, you need to be really sophisticated about identifying these different references

20:15.800 --&gt; 20:20.400
and making sure to identify the licenses.

20:20.400 --&gt; 20:26.160
If there was a standard way, like Reuse is introducing to actually quote these licenses

20:26.160 --&gt; 20:31.880
and if they, you know, were found at the same spot every time, that would make it a lot

20:31.880 --&gt; 20:34.760
easier to identify the applicable license.

20:34.760 --&gt; 20:38.800
And as I said, once you know what's in there and what applies, then actually working

20:38.800 --&gt; 20:42.360
through the following steps of saying, okay, these are the requirements, these are the

20:42.360 --&gt; 20:43.360
obligations.

20:43.360 --&gt; 20:46.040
This is what I need to do and this is how we'll do it in practice.

20:46.040 --&gt; 20:49.440
That becomes a lot easier because you know what you're working with.

20:49.440 --&gt; 20:50.440
So yes.

20:50.440 --&gt; 20:55.200
If there's a free software program and ask what are the most important things to remember

20:55.200 --&gt; 21:00.840
when I started writing a new free software project, if you tell them for every file you

21:00.840 --&gt; 21:07.040
create at a line on the top page to write down under which free software license you would

21:07.040 --&gt; 21:08.040
like to license it.

21:08.040 --&gt; 21:09.040
Yes.

21:09.040 --&gt; 21:12.200
I mean, on Reuse.soft you can see how we recommend doing that.

21:12.200 --&gt; 21:17.320
And if you then also include the full text of this license, which you named there, then

21:17.320 --&gt; 21:21.840
you would say it's already a huge step to make sure that the rights you would like to

21:21.840 --&gt; 21:26.480
grant others and the obligations you would like others to adhere to, that this is also

21:26.480 --&gt; 21:31.400
then enforced and people and companies can make sure they are compliant with what you wish.

21:31.400 --&gt; 21:34.800
It will definitely make it a lot easier, yes.

21:34.800 --&gt; 21:39.200
That's because you can look at everything or every single file and see, you know, this

21:39.200 --&gt; 21:46.960
is what they wanted for this specific file, for this software in general, yes.

21:46.960 --&gt; 21:53.440
Assuming back out to one other part, I mean, now with all those things to think about for

21:53.440 --&gt; 22:00.720
compliance, is it easier to be compliant with proprietary software licenses?

22:00.720 --&gt; 22:08.480
I don't think so, just because the proprietary licenses aren't as similar as the Open Source

22:08.480 --&gt; 22:10.880
in free software licenses.

22:10.880 --&gt; 22:16.920
If you really look at the obligations and requirements, of course, yes, there are differences, but

22:16.920 --&gt; 22:22.240
even though there are hundreds of free software licenses out there, it really comes down to

22:22.240 --&gt; 22:27.800
a handful of obligation and requirements that you need to comply with when looking at

22:28.280 --&gt; 22:29.280
free software.

22:29.280 --&gt; 22:37.280
So, complying with that is actually rather similar irrespective of the license that you're

22:37.280 --&gt; 22:38.440
really using, yes.

22:38.440 --&gt; 22:41.920
As I said, of course, in detail, there are differences.

22:41.920 --&gt; 22:46.600
If you look at proprietary licenses, they are often considerably longer than free software

22:46.600 --&gt; 22:51.600
licenses and there are differences in detail and it also depends on, you know, what is your

22:51.600 --&gt; 22:52.600
use case?

22:52.720 --&gt; 22:58.080
Often different licenses for, as I said, software has a service and then on premise licenses

22:58.080 --&gt; 23:03.360
or per user, there's just a lot of difference, which is perfectly understandable because,

23:03.360 --&gt; 23:08.400
you know, your software may be written for a different scenario, but yeah, it's just harder

23:08.400 --&gt; 23:13.840
because you need to look at every single license, whereas with free software licenses, you

23:13.840 --&gt; 23:20.680
know, at least there's an average you can make.

23:20.680 --&gt; 23:25.680
Is there a difference in suing free software copyright violations and proprietary copyright

23:25.680 --&gt; 23:27.200
violations?

23:27.200 --&gt; 23:30.600
Not really, at least not from a copyright perspective, right?

23:30.600 --&gt; 23:36.360
So, it's always about the license infringement or the copyright infringement, which gives

23:36.360 --&gt; 23:40.680
you kind of the entrance to enforcing your copyrights.

23:40.680 --&gt; 23:41.520
You'll need that.

23:41.520 --&gt; 23:46.560
If you want to enforce your copyright, you'll need that infringement in both cases, right?

23:46.560 --&gt; 23:53.440
I think with free software, it may be a bit easier to establish the infringements just

23:53.440 --&gt; 23:59.440
because, you know, if the source code's not available, you can easily establish that, right?

23:59.440 --&gt; 24:01.760
That may be a difference, but that's more practical difference.

24:01.760 --&gt; 24:05.000
It's not really a legal difference, right?

24:05.000 --&gt; 24:11.320
Would you say that in today's world where free software is used more and more in all kind

24:11.320 --&gt; 24:20.480
of products, from very small devices to big servers, super computers, are the copyright

24:20.480 --&gt; 24:26.640
law, which we have in Europe, are they up to those wide use of free software?

24:26.640 --&gt; 24:30.880
Well, that depends on what you're looking at, I think.

24:30.880 --&gt; 24:35.200
If you're looking at compliance, which is really what we talked about today, I think they

24:35.200 --&gt; 24:40.320
are, just because it really, you know, that's not a question of copyright as such.

24:40.320 --&gt; 24:45.880
Of course, the free software licenses are kind of embedded in the copyright laws, but

24:45.880 --&gt; 24:50.520
the compliance aspects really are a question of the individual license.

24:50.520 --&gt; 24:55.040
And then it's just what are your claims that you can make on a copyright law, right?

24:55.040 --&gt; 24:56.600
So that's the only connection there.

24:56.600 --&gt; 25:00.440
And if you look at the claims, you know, they are pretty average.

25:00.440 --&gt; 25:05.240
That's, you know, just the standard claims that you would expect to have in case of infringement.

25:05.240 --&gt; 25:10.200
If you look at like the more proactive part and not the, not the compliance, I'm using

25:10.200 --&gt; 25:16.000
your software and need to comply with the license aspect, I think there are indeed some issues.

25:16.000 --&gt; 25:20.800
So if you look, for example, at the newest copyright directive for the EU, there were heavy

25:20.800 --&gt; 25:26.080
discussions whether, you know, all of these obligations that host providers, for example,

25:26.080 --&gt; 25:30.360
have actually work for free software and distributing free software.

25:30.360 --&gt; 25:37.320
So I think, you know, that is probably, or in that area, it's probably not so much the

25:37.320 --&gt; 25:47.760
case that the current laws actually, you know, meet all the needs of free software.

25:47.760 --&gt; 25:51.280
Miriam, you probably know that we regularly have to sell our free software day, but we

25:51.280 --&gt; 25:55.120
are saying developers for the effort at work, and I wanted to know if you want to thank

25:55.120 --&gt; 26:01.800
somebody for their work or mention of software.

26:01.800 --&gt; 26:07.480
Not so much, thank you, but what I really liked or where was really, you know, positively

26:07.480 --&gt; 26:13.520
surprised, as you mentioned in the beginnings, I'm doing data protection and GDPR and free

26:13.520 --&gt; 26:15.200
software, kind of the mix.

26:15.200 --&gt; 26:21.760
And when the GDPR first became applicable, the Knew, which is the supervisory authority

26:21.760 --&gt; 26:28.520
in France, they published their data protection impact assessment tool under GPL 3.

26:28.520 --&gt; 26:33.200
And it was just broadly available and, you know, they really did a nice job complying

26:33.200 --&gt; 26:38.840
with the requirements, and it just made me personally really happy to see this overlap.

26:38.840 --&gt; 26:44.000
And you know, then you could actually go through it, and it made it a lot easier for companies

26:44.000 --&gt; 26:47.960
to actually look at this tool and say, well, is this something that we could work with?

26:47.960 --&gt; 26:53.680
Because this is, at least for Germany, a totally new requirement that we now need to meet

26:53.680 --&gt; 27:00.720
under the GDPR, can we work with free software, and can we make this thing work for us?

27:00.720 --&gt; 27:05.600
And I thought that was a great idea, you know, to do it that way and, you know, to actually

27:05.600 --&gt; 27:08.720
do a nice job publishing that.

27:08.720 --&gt; 27:14.320
So yeah, if I wanted to mention something, that would be my mention here.

27:14.320 --&gt; 27:15.320
Thank you.

27:15.320 --&gt; 27:16.320
Thank you very much, medium.

And here is another voice from our community saying why they support the FSFE.

28:05.480 --&gt; 28:06.960
So my name is Christian.

28:06.960 --&gt; 28:09.880
I'm a biomedical scientist.

28:09.880 --&gt; 28:15.640
I've been with the FSFE for approximately five years now.

28:15.640 --&gt; 28:22.560
And I support the FSFE because I think that Free Software is an integral component for

28:22.560 --&gt; 28:25.040
digital sustainability.
