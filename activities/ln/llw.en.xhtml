    <h1>The Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop</h1>

    <p>
      The Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop (also known as the
      LLW) is organized every year by the FSFE to allow legal experts
      to discuss legal issues and best practices surrounding Free
      Software licences. This event has become the world’s foremost
      gathering of lawyers, technologists, and thought leaders on Free
      Software legal and licensing topics. With up to three days of
      talks in an informal and confidential atmosphere, the Workshop
      advances the state of the art of knowledge on topics ranging from
      license compliance to patent management, from project governance
      to corporate responsibility and even further to the cutting edge
      issues themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participation in the LLW provides legal professionals not only
      the opportunity to share knowledge and updates on the topics they
      are working on, but also a chance to meet and get acquainted with
      each other. These two aspects, combined, foster better license
      compliance by spreading best practices. The conference also
      provides a forum for different professionals to better understand
      each other, thus reducing the overall friction in the sector.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participation in the LLW is open to all Legal Network members.
      Invitations might be extended to non-members. If you think you
      might qualify, please send an e-mail directly to the Legal
      Coordinator, or to <a href="/contact/">our contact address</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As with the Legal Network mailing list, the LLW is subject to the
      Legal Network’s Code of Conduct and the Chatham House Rule (link
      to “LN Rules”).
