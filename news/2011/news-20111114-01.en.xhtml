      Erik Josefsson is the winner of the Nordic Free Software Award
      2011. With the award, the Swedish Foundation for Free Culture and
      Free Software (FFKP) honours Josefsson for his achievements as a
      campaigner for freedom in the information society.
    </p>

    <p>
      “We are proud to honour Erik for the tremendously important work
      he has done over the past ten years”, says FFKP Executive Director
      Jonas Öberg. “Erik has an exceptional ability to understand and
      explain the link between policy and technology. We are hugely
      grateful for his work. He is an inspiration to all of us.”
    </p>

    <p>
      From a career as a professional double-bass player, Josefsson
      gradually moved to full-time activism for freedom in the
      information society. He founded the Swedish Foundation for a Free
      Information Infrastructure (FFII Sweden) in 2004. Listed among
      Sweden's 30 most influential people during the European debate
      about software patents in 2005, Josefsson is among Europe's
      foremost defenders of software freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an activist in Brussels, Josefsson was instrumental in getting
      the European Parliament to reject the Software Patent Directive in
      2005. More recently, he prevented the EU from passing a law to cut
      off people's Internet access without due process, and is currently
      campaigning against <a href="http://act-on-acta.eu/">ACTA</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Josefsson currently works as an adviser on Internet policies for
      the Green/EFA Group in the European Parliament. He is busy
      building tools such as <a
        href="http://parltrack.euwiki.org/">ParlTrack</a> that make the
      Parliament's processes transparent to citizens. “This information
      holds real power”, says Henrik Sandklef, Vice President of the
      Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE). “Understanding how the
      Parliament works is very important for the Free Software movement.
      Erik does a great job of explaining software freedom to
      politicians, and helping freedom campaigners to understand
      Europe's power structure.”

    <p>
      Every year since 2007, <a href="https://ffkp.se/">FFKP</a> has
      used the Nordic Free Software Award to honour people, projects and
      organisations in the Nordic countries that have made a prominent
      contribution to the advancement of Free Software. Previous winners
      of the award are Bjarní Runar Einarsson (2010), Simon Josefsson
      and Daniel Stenberg (2009), Mats Östling (2008), and the
      Skolelinux project (2007).
