		<title>Local FSFE meeting with a talk about video streaming with Free Software in Berlin, Germany</title> 
 
		<body> 
			<p>On Thursday, April 9, there is the next local FSFE meeting Berlin, as usual in the e-lok (near Ostkreuz). This time, Gregor will talk about video streaming only using Free Software, about the potential of WebRTC and the built-in solution by Firefox (hello). Our meetings are a good possibility to meet other Fellows as well as other Free Software enthusiasts. You can get good food and best drinks at e-lok for a reasonable price and good mood for no cost. Official start is at 19:30. </p>
