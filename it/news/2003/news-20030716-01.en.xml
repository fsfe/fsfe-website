    <title>Being literate and numerate: a right that must endure.</title> 

    <body>FSF Europe, Associazione Software Libero and PLIO (OpenOffice.org 
    Italian Language Project) sign an open letter to Letiza Moratti (Italian
    Minister for Education, University and Research), concerning the agreement
    between the Ministry and Sun Microsystems about the adoption of StarOffice
    in Italian schools. The authors acknowledge a step towards interoperability
    and the use of free and documented formats, furthermore they ask the
    Ministry to equally promote the OpenOffice.org suite, whose truly free
    licence provides broader rights to its users.</body>
