<h2>Dangers for Free Software</h2>

<p>The <a 
href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0053">radio 
equipment directive 2014/53/EU</a> will have a negative effect on users and 
companies. Because device manufacturers will have to assess every software 
regarding its compliance with existing national radio regulations (Art. 
3.3(i)), we expect it to become impossible or very hard for users and companies 
to use alternative software on devices they bought â€“ routers, mobile phones, 
Wi-Fi-cards, or almost all Internet-of-Things devices in the future.</p>

<p>This not only is a severe burden for those affected but also
violating the customers' rights of free choice. They will be locked in
to software of the manufacturers because they cannot choose the software
and hardware independently anymore. This aspect is crucial because
alternative, especially Free Software, often satisfies special
requirements regarding security, technical features and standards, or
legal demands.</p>

<p>The status quo erects high barriers for customers to control their
soft- and hardware. Increasingly many devices use radio signals, among
them very sensible ones like mobile phones, personal computers,
household equipment, or the internet access gateways in homes and
companies. For the sake of security and fair competition we have to make
sure that people can always choose the software they want to run on
their devices without additional constraints, as long as the software
does respect current laws (see the chapter about security).</p>

<p>We see negative outcomes of this directive already. Several
manufacturers have installed modules on their devices checking which
software is loaded. This is done by built-in non-free and non-removable
modules disrespecting users' rights and demands to use technology which
they can control. For the future we are afraid of modules not only
checking software but also the exact location or behaviour of the
owners.</p>

<h2>Dangers for competition</h2>

<p>There are many companies depending on the usage of alternative and
Free Software firmware on devices. Among them are wireless network
providers, creators of more secure mobile operating systems, or
programmers of custom-tailored and more efficient software solutions for
existing hardware. All of them might be hindered and discriminated
economically against larger manufacturers with their inhouse software.
Alternative software is the foundation of many companies' products, and
we should prevent economic disadvantages for them.</p>

<p>Especially for smaller and medium-sized businesses we expect negative
outcomes, not only because of the dangers of their software not or
heavily delayed being assessed by manufacturers. But also due to the
expectable high costs for those manufacturing enterprises having to
assess each and every firmware thoroughly. This will also have an
additional negative impact on start-up businesses.</p>

<p>Concerning legal affairs we assume difficulties with existing license
conditions, for example with the GNU General Public License. It requires
all parts of the software to be under the same or a compatible license.
Manufacturers having to include proprietary non-compatible software
parts then might infringe the terms of the GNU GPL.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>We are in favor of the directive's aim to improve security of radio
devices but not at the unbalanced expense of users' freedom. For one
thing we are convinced that such strict regulations are not necessary
for typical consumer products with limited radio output power. And for
another thing we believe that such technical restructions will not
hinder those people willingly intending to violate applicable radio
regulations.</p>

<p>Especially Free Software firmwares are very advanced in terms of
security measurements, no least because technical errors get fixed
quickly in collaborative and transparent processes. If a software on a
device actually violate a radio regulation it would be the more
efficient way to support the software's creators instead of restricting
users' independence on a massively broad level.</p>

<h2>Innovation, Volunteering, Sustainability</h2>

<p>If the directive becomes effective without necessary exceptions (see
below) this will imply basic conditions for innovation negatively.
Progress is done by learning from past developments and walking new
paths. If all communicative devices are locked down, a huge area of
innovation will be too.</p>

<p>Same applies to charity initiatives and organisations depending on using 
custom software on devices they bought. Efforts of volunteer associations, for 
example <a href="http://freifunk.net/">Freifunk</a> helping people in need to 
connect to the internet, may be rendered void or at least handicapped severely. 
Since we are sure that this implication was not intended by the European 
institutions we ask for necessary changes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, alternative software on radio (and also non-radio)
devices also promotes a sustainable economy. There are many devices
still in working order which do not receive updates from the original
manufacturers anymore. In most cases, Free Software firmware has a much
longer support period which prevents users customers having to dispose
still working electronical equipment. In return, this also improves the
security of users since older hardware still receives security updates
after a manufacturer stops supporting those.</p>

<h2>Our demands</h2>

<h3>What we expect of EU institutions</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>We ask EU institutions to adopt delegated acts (Art. 44) which either

<ul>
  <li>makes general exceptions for all Free Software not developed by the 
  manufacturers of the respective radio equipment itself.</li>
  <li>make an exception for consumer electronics and/or for devices which in 
  general do not have the potential to jam forbidden radio spectrums 
  massively.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h3>What we expect of EU member states</h3>

<p>We ask member state legislations to interpret the directive's parts
in question as Free Software and user rights friendly as possible, and
to facilitate the users' and companies' concerns regarding the critical
points to EU institutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In all cases we demand the institutions to take care of consumer
rights. Users shall not be forced to use non-free software on their most
private radio equipment. Also, small and middle-sized manufacturers
shall not be burdened disproportionally by being forced to assess each
and every alternative software.</p>
