00:00.000 --&gt; 00:04.640
Before we start with the podcast, we would like to say thank you to all of you who support

00:04.640 --&gt; 00:07.740
the FSFE's work of money.

00:07.740 --&gt; 00:12.760
Working for software freedom and producing podcasts costs money.

00:12.760 --&gt; 00:18.200
Please consider supporting us with our nation on the FSFE.org/donate and in the

00:18.200 --&gt; 00:19.200
show notes.

00:30.000 --&gt; 00:37.440
Hello and welcome to the software freedom podcast.

00:37.440 --&gt; 00:41.320
This podcast is brought to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:41.320 --&gt; 00:45.840
We are a charity that empowers users to take control of technology.

00:45.840 --&gt; 00:49.640
I'm Bonnie Mehring and today we have a special episode.

00:49.640 --&gt; 00:55.840
Marta Andreoli, who is the Italian deputy coordinator, is talking to Paul Lundjili

00:55.840 --&gt; 00:58.080
about the first project.

00:58.080 --&gt; 01:03.520
And with this I would say let's explore what all the fuss is about.

01:03.520 --&gt; 01:09.360
Hello everyone, my name is Marta and I'm the deputy coordinator for the FSFE Italy

01:09.360 --&gt; 01:10.560
project.

01:10.560 --&gt; 01:16.320
I'm here tonight together with Paul Lundjili, who is the technical inspector for Italian

01:16.320 --&gt; 01:21.360
schools in the autonomy of Bozzano Italy.

01:21.360 --&gt; 01:22.360
Welcome Paolo.

01:22.360 --&gt; 01:23.360
Hi.

01:23.360 --&gt; 01:24.360
Hi.

01:24.360 --&gt; 01:25.360
Nice to see you, Marta.

01:25.760 --&gt; 01:26.360
Good.

01:26.360 --&gt; 01:30.680
I'm really happy that you're here with us tonight with me, actually.

01:30.680 --&gt; 01:35.480
And Paolo is also the coordinator of the FUSE project.

01:35.480 --&gt; 01:40.680
Paolo can you tell me and can you tell us a bit more about what the FUSE is all about?

01:40.680 --&gt; 01:45.440
Yeah, FUSE stands for free upgrade in software schools.

01:45.440 --&gt; 01:53.200
We modified a little bit the acronym into free upgrade for a digitally sustainable school.

01:53.200 --&gt; 01:59.840
And this project was born in 2005 with the idea of giving students and teachers the

01:59.840 --&gt; 02:05.360
possibility to use free software, not only at schools but also at home.

02:05.360 --&gt; 02:07.200
Okay, that's amazing.

02:07.200 --&gt; 02:08.200
Thank you Paolo.

02:08.200 --&gt; 02:11.760
I'm really fond of this project, I'm a big fan.

02:11.760 --&gt; 02:17.800
And I know that this project is also really very much considered a project of public value.

02:17.800 --&gt; 02:23.480
And I also know that the project has some ties with the FUSE campaign, public money,

02:23.480 --&gt; 02:24.880
public code.

02:24.880 --&gt; 02:28.520
So I would love for you now to share a bit more on this.

02:28.520 --&gt; 02:37.000
Yeah, several projects and institutions around the world recognized not only to our project,

02:37.000 --&gt; 02:41.960
so to the FUSE project, but also to all free software projects around the world that

02:41.960 --&gt; 02:47.040
they bring, they constitute public value and why?

02:47.040 --&gt; 02:54.720
Because especially for projects that are, let's say, funded by public administrations,

02:54.720 --&gt; 03:02.240
those, that money that is used to develop those projects is converted into public code.

03:02.240 --&gt; 03:04.880
And this is what happened with FUSE.

03:04.880 --&gt; 03:13.600
We not only reused a very good free software starting from the Debian GNU Linux distribution,

03:13.600 --&gt; 03:20.280
but we also reused a lot of applications that constitute all the, let's say, educational

03:20.280 --&gt; 03:24.800
applications that we installed in the FUSE distribution.

03:24.800 --&gt; 03:33.520
We also developed a lot of code using public money and this is why it is considered that

03:33.520 --&gt; 03:36.680
the outcome of this is a public value.

03:36.680 --&gt; 03:42.880
So the public code, the documentation, and everything that comes out of the project

03:42.880 --&gt; 03:47.280
is, let's say, given back to the whole community.

03:47.280 --&gt; 03:53.280
Okay, wow, that's really amazing and it's really a complete target for what the FUSE stands

03:53.280 --&gt; 03:57.080
for for the public money, public code campaign.

03:57.080 --&gt; 04:01.400
Could you tell me then a bit more about who uses the project and do you also have some

04:01.400 --&gt; 04:04.760
metrics in terms of numbers of users?

04:04.760 --&gt; 04:13.200
Yes, the FUSE project is used by all Italian schools of the autonomous province of Bolzano.

04:13.200 --&gt; 04:22.920
And so the numbers are that it is used by around 16,000 students and 1,900 teachers.

04:22.920 --&gt; 04:29.880
It is used in 74 schools and the number of PCs and desktops and the notebooks we have

04:29.880 --&gt; 04:39.720
is around 4,500 and we also have 64 servers which have a complete free software stack starting

04:39.720 --&gt; 04:48.040
from Proxmox and ending it to Debian and all software that is needed to run a school

04:48.040 --&gt; 04:49.040
network.

04:49.040 --&gt; 04:50.440
Okay, amazing.

04:50.440 --&gt; 04:56.880
I was once in a presentation with you and I remember that you told us and you shared

04:56.880 --&gt; 05:02.920
that you were saving a lot of money because you actually used this project.

05:02.920 --&gt; 05:08.440
So I was wondering if you perhaps remember now without having the data with you, how much

05:08.440 --&gt; 05:16.080
money did this project make you save and by you, I mean the province of Bolzano?

05:16.080 --&gt; 05:28.880
Yeah, consider that before 2005, we were spending around 300,000 euro for proprietary software

05:28.880 --&gt; 05:30.720
licenses.

05:30.720 --&gt; 05:42.280
Starting from 2005, okay, we spent some money to exit the proprietary lock-in and starting

05:42.280 --&gt; 05:52.040
from 2007 till today practically, consider that in 16 years we spent less than what we

05:52.040 --&gt; 05:55.880
spent for one year of proprietary software licenses.

05:55.880 --&gt; 06:06.520
So in 16 years from 2007 till 2022, we spent around 303,000 euro which is less than one

06:06.520 --&gt; 06:09.760
year of proprietary software licenses.

06:10.080 --&gt; 06:15.840
Wow, that's really amazing, Paolo and big congratulations for that.

06:15.840 --&gt; 06:21.040
And because of what you just shared, I have a question that I think the audience that

06:21.040 --&gt; 06:26.720
is listening to us might be interested in hearing and especially they might be interested

06:26.720 --&gt; 06:30.040
in hearing your answer to this question.

06:30.040 --&gt; 06:35.400
And my question would be if someone wants to replicate this project, do you have a blueprint

06:35.400 --&gt; 06:39.560
that you created through the years and can you share it with us?

06:39.560 --&gt; 06:41.320
Would you be willing to share it with us?

06:41.320 --&gt; 06:51.760
We were in contact with some other schools and people around Italy.

06:51.760 --&gt; 06:56.680
So first of all, I would like to say that Fuss is not only used in South Tyrol, it's

06:56.680 --&gt; 07:03.480
also used for example in one high school in Venice.

07:03.480 --&gt; 07:06.640
It has been used for several years.

07:06.640 --&gt; 07:14.880
It's used in Florence, in a so-called Lichero, Nicol√≤ Rodolico in Florence and some other

07:14.880 --&gt; 07:22.040
schools in Italy for example, Ancona.

07:22.040 --&gt; 07:29.920
We were asked by Liguria for example to give them a blueprint to replicate a project and

07:29.920 --&gt; 07:36.000
we work with them towards a document for replicating it.

07:36.000 --&gt; 07:41.280
And the last effort was doing more or less the same thing with the schools in Venice.

07:41.280 --&gt; 07:51.080
So we were contacted by the region of Venice and they asked us to give them some help in

07:51.080 --&gt; 07:56.080
recreating the ingredients for replicating Fuss in the region.

07:56.080 --&gt; 07:59.200
Okay, that's beautiful and did you already achieve this?

07:59.200 --&gt; 08:00.200
Did you do it?

08:00.200 --&gt; 08:03.480
They decided to start with the three schools.

08:03.480 --&gt; 08:08.040
So they chose three schools and the schools are going to start with Fuss.

08:08.040 --&gt; 08:12.480
Okay, so I'm looking forward to hear the results of what they will do as well.

08:12.480 --&gt; 08:17.120
And I hope many listeners to our podcast will also decide to get in touch with you where

08:17.120 --&gt; 08:20.960
we share the podcast, we will also share your contact if that's okay with you so that

08:20.960 --&gt; 08:24.480
people can get in touch.

08:24.480 --&gt; 08:30.400
But before closing, I also wanted to touch on another point because I've seen by reading

08:30.400 --&gt; 08:35.960
newspaper articles and links that you also sent me and other friends shared that this

08:35.960 --&gt; 08:42.520
project also can be called as a social project because you interacted with other realities

08:42.520 --&gt; 08:44.600
from the territory.

08:44.600 --&gt; 08:50.720
And I'm really also always fascinated by these kind of corporations.

08:50.720 --&gt; 08:56.320
So I would really love if you can elaborate a bit more on these and share your experience.

08:56.320 --&gt; 08:57.320
Sure.

08:57.320 --&gt; 09:04.840
I mean, together with the local Linux user group, the Linux user group, Bozano-Bulsana,

09:04.840 --&gt; 09:13.680
we started in 2017 and so called Open Linux Desk where people could come and we were

09:13.680 --&gt; 09:20.360
helping them in installing Linux and free software on their machines.

09:20.360 --&gt; 09:26.520
And starting with a pandemic period, we saw that it was a great, two big digital divide

09:26.520 --&gt; 09:33.800
in families and we decided to gather a lot of used PCs and believe me, there are companies

09:33.800 --&gt; 09:41.080
that throw away and also public institutions that throw away very good PCs and we decided

09:41.080 --&gt; 09:47.520
to gather them and install GNU Linux and lots of free software, practically the FUSD

09:47.520 --&gt; 09:54.600
distribution for students and consider that in three, four years we were able to give

09:54.600 --&gt; 10:00.520
to families and students in particular 800 PCs.

10:00.520 --&gt; 10:08.080
So following this idea, we were also able to get in contact with other projects, for

10:08.080 --&gt; 10:15.800
example MiniBizet, which is a project that started several years ago in order to create

10:15.800 --&gt; 10:24.280
a small city for children and there are several other projects in Europe of the same kind

10:24.280 --&gt; 10:26.600
as the one here in Bozano.

10:26.600 --&gt; 10:32.120
And in 2024, so this year, this was the first year where they wanted to digitalize the

10:32.120 --&gt; 10:36.040
whole city and they needed around 80 PCs.

10:36.040 --&gt; 10:42.200
And so what we proposed them was to start a circular economy project where we gathered

10:42.200 --&gt; 10:48.920
all PCs as we did with the school swap project and we installed free software on that.

10:48.920 --&gt; 10:55.000
So the same FUSD distribution, so they've been GNU Linux and a lot of educational software

10:55.000 --&gt; 11:04.560
and they were able to let's say work in a small city using computers for the first time.

11:04.560 --&gt; 11:07.560
Yes, and computers with free software installed on it.

11:07.560 --&gt; 11:12.840
Of the amazing, amazing, really great work and thank you for sharing with us.

11:12.840 --&gt; 11:15.920
I hope listeners will be inspired by your stories.

11:15.920 --&gt; 11:19.360
That's the whole purpose of having this interview with you.

11:19.360 --&gt; 11:25.080
And yeah, to wrap it up, we touched on so many points and especially I think so many

11:25.080 --&gt; 11:29.520
important values came up from the talk that we just had.

11:29.520 --&gt; 11:36.000
So to close our talk, I would like to ask you if you can give us a bit of a summary of

11:36.000 --&gt; 11:42.960
the main pillars that actually build up this project and that are at the core of the project.

11:42.960 --&gt; 11:49.600
I heard some of them, for example, we talk about free and Open Source software, about

11:49.600 --&gt; 11:56.000
open standards, about open teaching materials, open access and I would also say open hardware.

11:56.080 --&gt; 11:58.080
Of course, if you can.

11:58.080 --&gt; 12:05.000
Yes, we are talking very often about the concept of digital sustainability.

12:05.000 --&gt; 12:11.760
So sustainability is a concept that has been used a lot, especially in the past few years,

12:11.760 --&gt; 12:17.480
but we insist on the fact that we don't have only to talk about free software,

12:17.480 --&gt; 12:27.280
but also, as you said, about open standards, the importance of using open standards in schools,

12:27.280 --&gt; 12:31.320
because I work in schools and for public administrations.

12:31.320 --&gt; 12:38.320
And the importance of starting creating open teaching materials, there's a lot of work that

12:38.320 --&gt; 12:45.440
has to be done, Wikimedia projects as Wikibooks are working in that direction.

12:45.440 --&gt; 12:47.600
And also Vikiversity, for example.

12:47.600 --&gt; 12:58.640
So we very often say we don't need to reinvent or reuse or say redevelop new platforms

12:58.640 --&gt; 13:02.480
for storing their teaching materials, for example.

13:02.480 --&gt; 13:10.160
And of course, open access is quite important as one of the several pillars of digital sustainability,

13:10.200 --&gt; 13:17.240
because without open access, we couldn't access neither free software and all other resources.

13:17.240 --&gt; 13:25.360
And these four pillars are, let's say, built one of the most important things that we also have,

13:25.360 --&gt; 13:31.400
we need in schools, this is one of the big objects of schools, which is knowledge sharing.

13:31.400 --&gt; 13:43.800
So without, I mean, this main point, which is knowledge sharing, we couldn't have the other four resources

13:43.800 --&gt; 13:45.400
that we're talking about.

13:45.400 --&gt; 13:53.120
Yeah, and knowledge sharing is also the point of our podcasts and of sharing these experiences with you all.

13:53.120 --&gt; 13:56.720
So I thank you, Paolo, for the talk we had.

13:56.720 --&gt; 14:01.000
It was a very inspiring chat, and I look forward to many more.

14:01.000 --&gt; 14:08.160
And thank you also to all the listeners who tuned in for the podcast episode on the FUS project with Paolo Dunjili.

14:08.160 --&gt; 14:11.880
And see you next time, stay tuned for the next guest.

14:11.880 --&gt; 14:13.280
Bye-bye.
