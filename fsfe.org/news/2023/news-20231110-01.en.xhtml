<p><em>"He is not only a talented technologist, but also a tireless advocate 
of digital freedom as a universal right"</em>. With these words, the 
European SFS Award was presented to Nextcloud founder Frank Karlitschek 
today, 10 November, at SFSCON 2023. This is the first time that the 
well-established SFS Award has been extended to the European level, a 
joint collaboration with the initiators of this recognition, the Linux 
User Group BZ (LUGBZ) and the Free Software Foundation Europe 
(FSFE).</p>

<p>More than two decades ago, Frank Karlitschek founded the community 
website KDE-Look.org, then GNOME-look.org and finally openDesktop.org 
to improve Free Software. In 2010, with the ownCloud project, the 
Stuttgart-based Free Software developer laid the foundation for a 
platform that allows people to store their data securely and 
independently. This led to the launch of Nextcloud in 2016.</p>

<p>Today, Nextcloud is a Free Software collaboration tool used 
by millions worldwide <em>"and which some of the biggest technology companies 
around the world fear as a competitor"</em>, as Matthias Kirschner, FSFE 
president, pointed out during the Award ceremony. Kirschner further 
noted that <em>“even in situations where he could have personally or with 
his company benefited financially, he decided to follow his principles 
and ensure that there is a fair level playing field for others in our 
community as well"</em>.</p>

<p><em>He[Karlitschek] followed his ideals and his strong believe that 
users should have the rights to use, understand, share, and improve 
their software—and created a comprehensive, user-friendly and secure 
collaboration platform</em>, added Rafael Barbieri, LUGBZ member.</p>

<p>In his thank you speech, Karlitschek said he can just accept the 
award in the name for the Nextcloud community, the ones that really 
deserve this recognition.</p>

<h2>The European SFS Award</h2> 
<p>The first SFS Award was presented to Hugo Leiter in 2004 at the SFSCON 
South Tyrol Free Software Conference for the implementation of Libre 
Office in all municipalities of South Tyrol. Twenty years later, at the 
start of the SFSCON at the NOI Techpark, the award was presented for 
the first time on a European level. The Free Software Foundation Europe 
teamed up with the initiator of the award, LUGBZ, to jointly honour 
Free Software developers who have made outstanding contributions to the 
dissemination and promotion of Free Software in Europe.</p>

<h2>2023 Laudatio</h2> 
<p><strong>Rafael</strong>: It’s an honour for me (on behalf of the Board of Linux User Group Bozen-Bolzano-Bulsan) to 
present the first European SFS Award, continuing a twenty year old 
tradition, since the first SFS Award was assigned in 2004 to Hugo 
Leiter, for introducing Libre Office in all municipalities of South 
Tyrol. Traditionally the AWARD has always been given to someone who 
greatly contributed to the culture of Free Software in South Tyrol, and 
this tradition will continue, but as SFSCON this year we extended the 
narrative to the essential European level. LUGBZ, promoting digital 
sustainability in South Tyrol, joined forces with an important European 
association active in the sphere of Free Software, namely the Free 
Software Foundation Europe (FSFE). Let me introduce the president: 
Matthias Kirchner.</p>

<p><strong>Matthias</strong>: Thank you Raphael! As the FSFE we have now participated 
many years at the SFSCON, and saw how the LUGBZ was awarding great Free 
Software contributors from Italy – so we were happy when we have been 
approached to join forces and award European Free Software contributors 
together with the LUGBZ.</p>

<p><strong>Raphael</strong>: As in previous years, we received many nominations for 
potential winners. It was not easy for us to choose a winner, since 
many of the suggested candidates made enormous contribution to Free 
Software.</p>

<p><strong>Matthias</strong>: The deciding factor for us this year was to choose a 
European who lives the values of software freedom, a person who has 
dedicated decades of work to software freedom and brought it to the 
next level, a true visionary and pioneer of software freedom.</p>

<p><strong>Raphael</strong>: In 2001, over two decades ago, he started KDE-Look.org, 
later GNOME-look.org, as well as openDesktop.org to improve Free 
Software, and supported many initiatives in our field, including 
serving as Vice President of KDE e.V.</p>

<p>In 2010 at Akademy he laid the foundations for a platform that 
enabled millions of people to store their data securely and 
self-determined on servers. He promoted Open Standards, and inspired 
people to join the movement for software freedom.</p>

<p>With the development of a remote collaboration tool for teams, which 
is developed under the freedom protecting GNU AGPL license, he followed 
his ideals and his strong believe that users should have the rights to 
use, understand, share, and improve their software – and created a 
comprehensive, user-friendly and secure collaboration platform.</p>

<p><strong>Matthias</strong>: His tireless commitment to software freedom has resulted 
in a Free Software product which some of the biggest technology 
companies around the world fear as a competitor.</p>

<p>Even in situations where he could have personally or with his company 
benefited financially, he decided to follow his principles and ensure 
that there is a fair level playing field for others in our community as 
well.</p>

<p><strong>Raphael</strong>: He is not only a gifted technologist, but also a champion 
of the idea of digital freedom as a universal right. With his work he 
lives the ideals of transparency, privacy, and individual control over 
digital information, but he also laid the foundation for a diverse and 
engaged community.</p>

<p><strong>Matthias</strong>: His dedication, his vision, and his strong principles 
enriched and inspired many in our community. We are deeply grateful for 
his contributions and look forward to a future he helps shape.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we hereby award Frank Karlitschek, the founder of 
Nextcloud, the European SFS Award 2023.</p>
