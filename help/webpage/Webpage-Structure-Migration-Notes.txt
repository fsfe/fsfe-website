Migration/transition notes:
***************************

The technology necessary to implement the structure described in the
Webpage-Structure document are already present and in use. In other
words: We can keep using the XSL/XHTML technology currently being
used. 

But the way pages will be built & served will change.

Right now, <country>.fsfeurope.org gets served out of /<county>/.

With the new structure, we create full checkouts of the repository
that get built with a certain countrification; which means that the
sections with available countrification get navigation/overview pages
with according supplementation. The <country>.fsfeurope.org pages also
get served out of / then.


This way we also ensure that

	http://www.fsfeurope.org/<someaddressoranother>

and

	http://france.fsfeurope.org/<someaddressoranother>
	http://germany.fsfeurope.org/<someaddressoranother>
	http://italy.fsfeurope.org/<someaddressoranother>
        ...

will always exist and bring people to the same page - even if there is
a different countrification.


Important: We must make sure that old link-addresses remain accessible
in order to make sure that existing links to our page aren't broken.
This surely is work, but it won't get easier with time.

The structure has been designed in a way to allow the links to remain
as similar as possible, but we won't be able to maintain that for
every page - in such cases we may need to create a list of
redirections for the web server that will bring people to the new
page.
