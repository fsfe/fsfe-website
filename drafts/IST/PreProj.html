The proposal abstract should be a very short and precise presentation of the
main features of the proposal. Why is it proposed and what problem is it
solving? What are the objectives? How will the objectives be achieved? What
results are expected? This proposal abstract will be used together with the
proposal summary description in form A2 in the evaluation process and in
communications about the proposals to the interested parties (Commission
services and programme committees, etc.). Please use plain typed text, avoiding
formulae and other special characters. If the proposal is written in a language
other than English, please include in form A1 an English version of the
abstract.

<P>
Although there are many hosting facilities around the world, no
software package is designed to setup and maintain a set of
machines dedicated to this purpose. The &NAME; project will
provide a generic solution that can be used and adapted by all
of them.

<h2>Context</h2>
Most of free or open source software is collaboratively developped using an
hosting plateform. They are mostly web sites. The frontend integrates different
functionnalities that are available to project developpers and administrators
and linked them with each other. The backend is mainly implemented with
scripts.
A hosting plaform is a web site that provides functionnalities to
developpers. 

<p>The following functionalities are the most
usualy supported in hosting platforms:
<ul>
<li> users and groups of users management, 
<li> project repository (usualy based on Concurent Versionning System),
<li> per project web pages and document sharing,
<li> per project mailing lists and web forums,
<li> bugtracking system,
<li> project management system (audit, task management),
<li> global site management and information feeding.
</ul>
<p>
As far as we know, there is at least 4 different types of platforms : 
<ul>
<li> SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/)
<li> Savannah (http://savannah.gnu.org/),
<li> VHFFS (http://tuxfamily.org/),
<li> and Picolibre (http://picolibre.eu.org/).
</ul>
<p>
The two leaders in hosting platforms are the 
SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/) site and Savannah (http://savannah.gnu.org/).
<p>
Hosting platforms are very useful and powerful tools. Many free software 
developpers already use them for their work, and we are sure
we will need more and more hosting platforms in a near future.
<p>
However, the existing solutions have some 
drawbacks, that refrain their wide adoption as well in the Libre software
community than in the proprietary software industry. Indeed
they were poorly designed and had evolved quickly to provide
functionnalities to developpers. The resulting platforms suffer from some 
annoying flaws :

<ul> 
<li> Also due to the number of services and their inter-relations, it is not
	simple to set up a new site that provides hosting. This is a real
	brake to a large number of sites using this technology.
	There is no complete solutions to install easily any of the technologies
	described above.
<li> They are hard to distribute, they were mainly designed as a front end to
	a group of dedicated machines that provide the given set of 
	functionnalities, versionning system, web access, or data base 
	access. Even if the access is remote all data is centralized,
	as one site hosts a huge number of projects. This is a bad
	practice in terms of data safety, data access and scalability.
<li> They rely too much on managing procedures and human control. For example, a site
	needs to be managed by peoplata for mrtg. These script are used on es.gnu.org and france.fsfeurope.org
es that acknowledge project creation.
<li> The most active effort to build such a sytem has recently become proprietary.
Therefore the produced work is not available.
</ul>
<h2>Presentation</h2>
The goals of our project are to address many of these drawbacks and try to 
provide a new generation of software that will help design, implement, 
customize and deploy easily local hosting platforms as well as groups of 
hosting platforms.
<p>We will in the rest of this paper consider that a hosting platform 
provides the following functionalities:
users and groups of users management, 
project repository (usually based on Concurent Versionning System, but it will
not be mandatory),
per project web pages and document sharing,
per project mailing lists and web forums,
bugtracking system linked to a project management system,
global site management and information feeding.
<BR>
Our primary goal is to build a set of packages that is easy to
install on a virgin machine or a machine already used for other
purposes.
<BR>
Although we have in mind that thata for mrtg. These script are used on es.gnu.org and france.fsfeurope.org
e set of packages produced could be used to for
multiple purposes, our focus will be on development hosting facilities. 
<p>
The following picture summarize this project aims.
<p><hline>
<img src=hnet.png>
<p><hline>
<p>In this picture:
<ul>
<li> an ellipse means a network or group of sites that share information.
<li> A rectangular box with rounding corner means a hosting platform
	sharing information with the other platforms in the network.
<li> The "Data Bus" is the medium used by the platforms to exchange 
	      information using common data formats.
<li> A rectangular boxes means a developper machine that accesses the global
network transparently by using the hosting platform they prefer.
</ul>
<p>
Let's say that the left ellipse covers hosting platforms which topic is
small buziness accounting. And the right ellipse, covers 
hosting platforms that support personnal household accounting projects.
<p>
Hosts may access information on the data bus by a publish/subscribe mechanisms.
Host 3 is part of both networks, because it provides news on accounting
projects. It listens to the common data bus waiting for informations 
on projects releases, and sorts this information to put it in its own 
web pages.
<p>
Hosts from a same network may share information, as in our example hosts 2 and
3 agreed on sharing a developper list, that allows developper B to connect 
to hosts 2 and 3 with the same identity after his registration at host 2.
<p>
To achieve these goals, we propose the following actions :
<ul>

	      a bus àla XML Blaster);

	created network (for example savannah or sourceforge) ;
<li> to integrates this data format in an existing platform simple and easy to
	      install and to customize (picolibre) to create a network of
	      such platforms;
<li> to design prototype web sites, that will use the informations 
	provided by hosting platforms ;
<li> to test the usability and scalability of the solution by integrating 
	a platform in the country of each parteners to create the first 
	      network.
</ul>
<p>
The data formats will play the role of a common language to all types of 
platforms, allowing new platforms to be designed as well as integration of
existing platforms in a network of cooperative sites.
<p>
Using this data format, hosting platforms will be able to share informations
about developpers, projects, releases...
<p>
The final goal of the project is to help the developper using a global network
of resources easily.
