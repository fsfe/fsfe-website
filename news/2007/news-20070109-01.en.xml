      In this talk, Richard Stallman explains why Free Software is
      defined the way it is, the technical and political choices that
      have gotten the Free Software movement to where it is today, and
      what we have to do to prepare for what's ahead.  With more than
      20 years of practice, Stallman also entertains while telling the
      story.<br /> This transription work was undertaken by FSFE due
      to the very positive feedback from the transcripts about GPLv3.
