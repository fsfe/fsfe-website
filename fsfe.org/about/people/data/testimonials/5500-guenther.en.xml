      I'm very impressed with what the FSFE has achieved on the EU and national
      level. Back when I was working in the public sector I was able to glimpse
      the vast amounts of money that are thrown at lobbying for proprietary
      software and so called industry standards in Germany and the EU. It's
      astonishing how the FSFE has still managed to get itself heard. That is
      one of the reasons why I'm supporting the FSFE.
