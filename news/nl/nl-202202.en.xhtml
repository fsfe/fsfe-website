<h2>"I Love Free Software" Day: games, memes and more</h2>
  
  <p>
    Every 14th of February, people around the world celebrate the &quot;I Love Free Software&quot; Day by saying thank you to all the people contributing to software freedom. This year, we are organising a whole <a href="/news/2022/news-20220201-01.html">event dedicated to Free Software games</a> on Monday 14 February at 18:00-20:00 CET. You can learn the ins and outs of the Free Software gaming world from our guest speakers, or just play Veloren in real time afterwards with others who are attending the event. Make sure you <a href="https://registration.fsfe.org/ilovefs">register</a>; we are looking forward to hanging out with you on &#39;I Love Free Software&#39; Day.

<h2 id="podcast-0-a-d-with-0-proprietary-software">Podcast: 0 A.D. with 0 proprietary software</h2>
  
  <p>
    The real-time strategy game of ancient warfare, 0 A.D.: Empires Ascendant, is a Free Software game created by an international group of volunteer game developers. Programmers, artists, and historians combined their skills to create this imaginary ancient world. <a href="/news/podcast/episode-13.html">In a new episode, the host of the Software Freedom Podcast, Bonnie Mehring, discusses the growing popularity of the game with the game&#39;s project lead</a>. Stanislas Dolcini says that the decision to make the game Free Software made it last for so many years, as many people could contribute - and still can.

<p>
    Thank you for joining <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/free_software_foundation_europe_stand/">our virtual booth</a> in this year&#39;s online FOSDEM, it was fun to see the Free Software community come together once again. Also, we co-hosted the Legal and Policy Issues Devroom. Masafumi Ohta talked about his experience on teaching Free Software licenses and compliances at a university. Security expert Christopher Klootz addressed the role of international arbitration for security of Free Software.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Vittorio Bertola presented an update on the Digital Markets Act, the new European rules for online competition. Lucas Lasota, FSFE Project Manager, proposed Device Neutrality as the necessary principle to make sure we are able to run Free Software on our devices, without artificial barriers. Italo Vignoli showed how proprietary software gained ground during the pandemic. The Legal and Policy Issues Devroom organisers made closing remarks in a panel. The recordings will be published soon; find them first by <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/a/fsfe/video-channels">subscribing to our Peertube instance</a>.

<h2 id="interviewing-past-interns-for-20-years-fsfe">Interviewing past interns for 20 Years FSFE</h2>
  
  <p>
    In the final publication about 20 Years FSFE, we wanted to thank everyone who worked for the organisation in an internship position. <a href="/news/2022/news-20220121-01.html">We contacted eight former interns and asked them about their time at the FSFE and their current involvement with Free Software</a>. Diego Naranjo, George Brooke-Smith, Lucile Falgueyrac, Lyudmila Vaseva, Martin Husovec, Matti Lammi, Polina Malaja, and Stian Rødven-Eide reflected on what they learned during their internship. Since then, everyone has supported Free Software in their own way: as users, developers, researchers, advocates, FSFE donors, or FSFE volunteers.

  <p>
    In our Public Money? Public Code! initiative, we offer an exhaustive <a href="/activities/publiccode/brochure.html">brochure dedicated to public administrations</a>.  Now it is also <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/pmpc/ES/FSFE_Policy_Brochure_PMPC_ALL_es.pdf">available in Spanish</a>. Our volunteers recently translated the brochure, allowing the Spanish-speaking world to read about the benefits of modernising public infrastructure with Free Software in their own language.
  </p>

  <p>
    In an event sharing the good news, we invited experts to join. Luis Falcón, founder of GNUHealth; Ricardo Muñoz from Lliurex; Alexis Puente Montiel from Pica Pica HackLab; Francesc Busquets in representation of Linkat; and Aleix Pol Gonzalez, president of KDE, discussed PMPC developments in Spain. <a href="/news/2022/news-20220112-01.html">The videos are available in Spanish</a>.
