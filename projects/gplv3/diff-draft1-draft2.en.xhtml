</p>

<p>
                    Discussion Draft <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">1</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">2</span> of Version 3, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">16 Jan</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">27 July</span> 2006
</p>

<p>
THIS IS A DRAFT, NOT A PUBLISHED VERSION OF THE GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.
</p>

<p>
 Copyright (C) 2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc.      51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
</p>

<p>
 			    Preamble 
</p>

<p>
   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other program whose authors commit to using it. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(Some Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)</span>  You can apply it to your programs, too. 
</p>

<p>
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">programs;</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">programs,</span> and that you know you can do these things. 
</p>

<p>
   To protect your rights, we need to make requirements that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">These restrictions translate to</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore, you have</span> certain responsibilities <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">for you</span> if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
</p>

<p>
   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. 
</p>

<p>
   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. 
</p>

<p>
   For the developers' and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">author's</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">authors'</span> protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If the software is modified by someone else</span>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">For both users'</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">passed on,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">authors' sake,</span> the GPL <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ensures that recipients are told</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">requires</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">what they have is not the original,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">modified versions be marked as changed,</span> so that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">any</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">their</span> problems <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">introduced by others</span> will not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">reflect on</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">be associated erroneously with</span> the original <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">authors' reputations.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">version.</span> 
</p>

<p>
   Some <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">countries have adopted laws prohibiting software that enables</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">computers are designed to deny</span> users <span style="font-weight: bold;">access</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">escape from Digital Restrictions Management. DRM</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">install or run modified versions of the software inside them.  This</span> is fundamentally incompatible with the purpose of the GPL, which is to protect users' <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">freedom; therefore,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">freedom to change the software.  Therefore,</span> the GPL ensures that the software it covers will <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">neither</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> be <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">subject to, nor subject other works to, digital restrictions from which escape is forbidden.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">restricted in this way.</span> 
</p>

<p>
   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">We</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in places where they do, we</span> wish to avoid the special danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">makes it clear</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">assures</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">any patent must</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">patents cannot</span> be <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">used to render the program non-free.</span> 
</p>

<p>
 		       TERMS AND CONDITIONS <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span> 
</p>

<p>
 0.  Definitions. 
</p>

<p>
 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">A "licensed program" means any program or other work distributed under</span> 
</p>

<p>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">In</span> this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">License. The "Program"</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">License, each licensee is addressed as "you," while "the Program"</span> refers to any <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a</span> work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">containing the Program or a portion</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">it, either modified or unmodified. Throughout</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">authorship licensed under</span> this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">License, the term "modification"</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">License. A "modified" work</span> includes, without limitation, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">translation and extension.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">versions in which material has been translated or added.  A work "based on" another work means any modified version, formation of which requires permission under applicable copyright law.</span>  A "covered work" means either the <span style="font-weight: bold;">unmodified</span> Program or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">any</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">a</span> work based on the Program. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Each licensee is addressed as "you".</span> 
</p>

<p>
   To "propagate" a work means doing anything with it that requires permission under applicable copyright law, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">other than</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">except</span> executing it on a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">computer</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">computer,</span> or making <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">private modifications. This</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">modifications that you do not share.  Propagation</span> includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">sublicensing,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">making available to the public,</span> and in some countries other activities as well.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies, excluding sublicensing. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   A party's "essential patent claims" in a work are all patent claims that the party can give permission to practice, whether already acquired or to be acquired, that would be infringed by making, using, or selling the work.</span> 
</p>

<p>
 1. Source Code. 
</p>

<p>
   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source version of a work. 
</p>

<p>
   The <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">"Complete Corresponding Source Code"</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">"System Libraries" of an executable work include every subunit such that (a) the identical subunit is normally included as an adjunct in the distribution of either a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the object code runs, or a compiler used to produce the object code, or an object code interpreter used to run it, and (b) the subunit (aside from possible incidental extensions) serves only to enable use of the work with that system component or compiler or interpreter, or to implement a widely used or standard interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   The "Corresponding Source"</span> for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">understand, adapt, modify, compile, link,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">generate,</span> install, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">(for an executable work)</span> run the <span style="font-weight: bold;">object code and to modify the</span> work, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">excluding</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">except its System Libraries, and except</span> general-purpose tools <span style="font-weight: bold;">or generally available free programs which are</span> used <span style="font-weight: bold;">unmodified</span> in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">this</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Corresponding Source</span> includes <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">any</span> scripts used to control those activities, <span style="font-weight: bold;">interface definition files associated with the program source files,</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">any</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">the source code for</span> shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is <span style="font-weight: bold;">specifically</span> designed to require, such as by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">intimate</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">complex</span> data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work, and interface definition files associated with the program source files. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> Complete</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   The</span> Corresponding Source <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Code</span> also includes any encryption or authorization <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">codes</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">keys</span> necessary to install and/or execute <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">modified versions from</span> source code <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">of the work, perhaps modified by you,</span> in the recommended or principal context of use, such that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">its functioning in</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">they can implement</span> all <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">circumstances is identical to that of</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work, except as altered by your modifications. It also includes any decryption codes necessary to access or unseal</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">same functionality in</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work's output. Notwithstanding this,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">same range of circumstances.  (For instance, if the work is</span> a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">code need</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">DVD player and can play certain DVDs, it must be possible for modified versions to play those DVDs.  If the work communicates with an online service, it must be possible for modified versions to communicate with the same online service in the same way such that the service cannot distinguish.)  A key need</span> not be included in cases where use of the work normally implies the user already has <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">it. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> Complete Corresponding Source Code need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Complete Corresponding Source Code. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> As a special exception, the Complete Corresponding Source Code need not include a particular subunit if (a)</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">identical subunit is normally included</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">key and can read and copy it,</span> as <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">an adjunct</span> in <span style="font-weight: bold;">privacy applications where users generate their own keys.  However,</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribution of either</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">fact that</span> a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the operating system</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">key is generated based</span> on <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">which the executable runs or a compiler used to produce</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">executable or an</span> object code <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">interpreter used to run it, and (b) the subunit (aside from possible incidental extensions) serves only to enable use</span> of the work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">with that system component or compiler or interpreter,</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">is present in hardware that limits its use does not alter the requirement</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">implement a widely used or standard interface,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">include it in</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">implementation of</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Corresponding Source. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   The Corresponding Source may include portions</span> which <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">requires no patent license</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">do</span> not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">already generally available</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">formally state this License as their license, but qualify under section 7</span> for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">software</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">inclusion in a work</span> under this License. 
</p>

<p>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</span> 
</p>

<p>
 2. Basic Permissions. 
</p>

<p>
   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the <span style="font-weight: bold;">unmodified</span> Program.  The output from running it is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work based on the Program.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">covered work.</span>  This License acknowledges your rights of "fair use" or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. 
</p>

<p>
   This License <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">gives unlimited permission</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">permits you</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">privately modify</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">make</span> and run <span style="font-weight: bold;">privately modified versions of</span> the Program, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">provided you do not bring suit for patent infringement against anyone for</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">or have others make and run them on your behalf. However, this permission terminates, as to all such versions, if you bring suit against anyone for patent infringement of any of your essential patent claims in any such version, for</span> making, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">using</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">using, selling</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distributing their own works</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">otherwise conveying a work</span> based on the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Program in compliance with this License.</span> 
</p>

<p>
   Propagation of covered works <span style="font-weight: bold;">other than conveying</span> is permitted without <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">limitation provided it does</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">limitation.  Sublicensing is</span> not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">enable parties other than you to make or receive copies. Propagation which does enable them to do so</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.  Conveying</span> is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">permitted, as "distribution",</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">permitted</span> under the conditions <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">of sections 4-6</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">stated</span> below. 
</p>

<p>
 3. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Digital Restrictions Management. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> As a free software license, this License intrinsically disfavors technical attempts to restrict users' freedom to copy, modify, and share copyrighted works. Each of its provisions shall be interpreted in light of this specific declaration of the licensor's intent.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">No Denying Users' Rights through Technical Measures.</span> 
</p>

<p>
   Regardless of any other provision of this License, no permission is given <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">to distribute covered works that illegally invade users' privacy, nor</span> for modes of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribution</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">conveying</span> that deny users that run covered works the full exercise of the legal rights granted by this License. 
</p>

<p>
   No covered work constitutes part of an effective technological <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">protection measure: that is to say, distribution</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">"protection" measure under section 1201</span> of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Title 17 of the United States Code.  When you convey</span> a covered <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work as part</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a system</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">technical measures that include use of the covered work, and you disclaim any intention</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">generate</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">limit operation</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">access certain data constitutes general permission at least for development, distribution and use, under this License,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">modification</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">other software capable</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">the work as a means</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">accessing</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">enforcing</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">same data.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">legal rights of third parties against the work's users.</span> 
</p>

<p>
 4.[1] Verbatim Copying. 
</p>

<p>
  You may copy and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey</span> verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all license notices and notices of the absence of any warranty; <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> give all <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">recipients of</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">recipients, along with</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Program,</span> a copy of this License <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">along with the Program;</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">obey any additional terms present on parts of</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program in accord with</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">central list (if any) required by</span> section 7.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The recipients of these copies will possess all the rights granted by this License (with any added terms under section 7).</span> 
</p>

<p>
   You may charge <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a fee</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">any price or no price</span> for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the physical act of transferring a copy,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">each copy that you convey,</span> and you may <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">at your option</span> offer <span style="font-weight: bold;">support or</span> warranty protection for a fee. 
</p>

<p>
 5.[2] <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Distributing</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conveying</span> Modified Source Versions. 
</p>

<p>
 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Having modified a</span> 
</p>

<p>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">You may</span> copy <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">of the Program under the conditions of section 2, thus forming</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">and convey</span> a work based on the Program, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">you may copy and distribute such modifications</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">the modifications to produce it from the Program,</span> in the form of source code under the terms of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Section</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">section</span> 4 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
</p>

<p>
     a) The modified work must carry prominent notices stating that you     changed the work and the date of any change. 
</p>

<p>
     b) You must license the entire <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">modified</span> work, as a whole, under this     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License must apply, unmodified except as permitted by section 7     below, to the whole of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work, and all its parts, regardless of     how they are packaged.</span>  This License gives no permission to     license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such     permission if you have separately received it. 
</p>

<p>
     c) If the modified work has interactive user interfaces, each must     include a convenient feature that displays an appropriate     copyright notice, and tells the user that there is no warranty for     the program (or that you provide a warranty), that users may <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">redistribute</span>     <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey</span> the modified work under <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">these conditions,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">this License,</span> and how to view a     copy of this License together with the central list (if any) of     other terms in accord with section 7. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If</span>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Specifically, if</span> the     interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a     menu, a command to display this information must be prominent in     the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">list. Otherwise,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">list; otherwise,</span> the modified work must display this     information at <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">startup--except in the case that</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">startup.  However, if</span> the Program has <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">such</span> interactive <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">modes and does</span>     <span style="font-weight: bold;">interfaces that do</span> not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">display</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">comply with</span> this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">information at startup. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> These requirements apply to the</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">subsection, your</span> modified     work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">as a whole. If</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">need not make them comply. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> To the extent that</span> identifiable sections of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">the modified</span> work, added by you, are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey</span> them as separate <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">works for use</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">works,</span> not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">in combination with the Program. But when you distribute the same sections</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">specifically</span> for use in combination with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">covered works, no matter in what form such combination occurs, the whole of the combination must be licensed under this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to every part of the whole. Your sections may carry other terms as part of this combination in limited ways, described in section 7. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on</span> the Program. 
</p>

<p>
   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">copyright resulting from the</span> compilation <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">is</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">and its resulting copyright are</span> not used to limit the <span style="font-weight: bold;">access or</span> legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Mere inclusion</span>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Inclusion</span> of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

    You may copy and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey</span> a covered work in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Object Code</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">object code</span> form under the terms of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Sections</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">sections</span> 4 and 5, provided that you also <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey</span> the machine-readable <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Complete</span> Corresponding Source <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Code (herein the "Corresponding Source")</span> under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: 
</p>

<p>
     b) <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Convey</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Object Code</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">object code</span> in a physical product (including a     physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer,     valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer     spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give     any third <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">party, for a price no more than ten times your cost of physically performing source distribution,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">party</span> a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the     software in the product that is covered by this License, on a     durable physical medium customarily used for software <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">interchange; or, </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> c) Privately distribute the Object Code with</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">interchange,     for</span> a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">copy</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">price no more than your reasonable cost of physically     performing this conveying of source. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     [b1) Convey the object code in a physical product (including a     physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer,     valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer     spare parts or customer support for that product model, to provide     access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at     no charge.] </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy</span> of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">for occasional noncommercial distribution,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">occasionally and noncommercially,</span> and     only if you received the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Object Code</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">object code</span> with such an offer, in accord     with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Subsection b above. Or,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">subsection 6b or 6b1.</span>

</p>

<p>
     [If the place to copy the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Object Code</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">object code</span> is a network server, the     Corresponding Source may be on a different server that supports     equivalent copying facilities, provided you have explicitly     arranged with the operator of that server to keep the     Corresponding Source available for as long as needed to satisfy     these requirements, and provided you maintain clear directions     next to the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Object Code</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">object code</span> saying where to find the Corresponding     Source.]

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> When you release a work based on</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional Terms. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   You may have received</span> the Program, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">you may include your own terms covering added parts for which you have,</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">can give, appropriate copyright permission, as long as those</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">parts of it, under</span> terms <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">clearly permit all the activities</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">this License permits, or permit usage or relicensing under</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">supplement the terms of</span> this License. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Your</span>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">These additional</span> terms may <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">be written separately or may be this License plus</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">include</span> additional <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">written permission. If</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">permissions, as provided in subsection 7a, and additional requirements, as provided in subsection 7b.  When</span> you <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">so license your own added parts, those parts may be used separately under your terms, but</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey copies of a covered work, unless</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">entire</span> work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">remains</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">also permits use</span> under <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">this License. Those who copy the work, or works based on it,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">a previous version of this License, it</span> must <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">preserve your</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">list, in one central place in the source code, the complete set of additional</span> terms <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">just</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">governing all or part of the work. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   a. Additional Permissions. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Additional permissions make exceptions from one or more of the requirements of this License.  A license document containing a clause that permits relicensing or conveying under this License shall be treated as a list of additional permissions, provided that the license document makes clear that no requirement in it survives such relicensing or conveying. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Any additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program are treated</span> as <span style="font-weight: bold;">though</span> they <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">must preserve</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">were included in</span> this License, as <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">long as any substantial portion of</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">exceptions to its conditions, to</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">parts</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">extent that</span> they <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">apply to</span> are <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">present. </span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> Aside from</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">valid under applicable law.  If</span> additional <span style="font-weight: bold;">permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those</span> permissions, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">your</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional terms. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   b. Additional Requirements.  </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Additional requirements are</span> terms <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">may add limited</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">that further constrain use, modification or propagation of covered works.  This License affects only the procedure for enforcing additional requirements, and does not assert that they can be successfully enforced by the copyright holder. Only these</span> kinds of additional requirements <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">on your added parts, as follows: </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> a) They may</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">are allowed by this License: </span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     1) terms that</span> require that the origin of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">parts</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">material</span> they cover        not be misrepresented, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and/or</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">or</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">altered</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">modified</span> versions of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">them</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">that        material</span> be marked in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the source code, or marked there in</span> specific reasonable <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ways,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">ways</span> as different        from the original <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">version. </span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> c) They may</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">License; or </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     3) terms that</span> prohibit or limit the use for publicity purposes of        specified names of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">contributors, and they may</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">licensors or authors, or that</span> require that        certain specified <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">trademarks</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">trade names, trademarks, or service marks not</span>        be used for publicity purposes <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">only</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">without express permission,        other than</span> in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the</span> ways that are fair use under <span style="font-weight: bold;">applicable</span> trademark <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">law except with express permission. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> d) They may require</span>        <span style="font-weight: bold;">law; or </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     4) terms</span> that <span style="font-weight: bold;">require, if a modified version of</span> the <span style="font-weight: bold;">material they        cover is a</span> work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">contain functioning facilities</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">intended to interact with users through a        computer network,</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">allow</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">those</span> users <span style="font-weight: bold;">be able</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">immediately</span> obtain copies of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">its Complete</span>        <span style="font-weight: bold;">the</span> Corresponding Source <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Code. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> e) They may impose software patent retaliation, which means permission for use</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">your added parts terminates</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">the work through the same network        session;</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">may be terminated,</span> 
</p>

<p>
     <span style="font-weight: bold;">5) terms that</span> wholly or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">partially, under stated conditions,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">partially terminate, or allow termination        of, permission for use of the material they cover,</span> for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">users closely related to any party that has filed</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">a user        who files</span> a software patent lawsuit <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(i.e.,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">(that is,</span> a lawsuit        alleging that some software infringes a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">patent). The conditions must limit</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">patent) not filed in</span>        retaliation <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">to a subset of these two cases: 1. Lawsuits that lack</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">or defense against</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">justification</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">earlier filing</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">retaliating against other</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">another</span>        software patent <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">lawsuits that lack such justification. 2. Lawsuits that target part of this work,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">lawsuit,</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">other code that was elsewhere released together with the parts you added,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">in which</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">whole being under</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">allegedly infringing        software includes some of</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">terms used here for those parts. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> No other additional conditions are permitted</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">covered material, possibly</span> in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">your terms; therefore, no</span>        <span style="font-weight: bold;">combination with</span> other <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">conditions can be present on any work</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">software; or </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     6) terms</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">uses this License. This License does not attempt</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">are precisely equivalent in type and extent</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">enforce your terms,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">a        requirement expressly stated in this License,</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">assert</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">they</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">deny        permission for activities that</span> are <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">valid</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">clearly not permitted,        expressly</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">enforceable</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">otherwise,</span> by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">you; it simply does not prohibit you from employing them. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> When others modify the work, if they modify your parts of it, they may release such parts of their versions under</span> this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">License without</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">License. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> All other</span> additional <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">permissions, by</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">requirements,</span> including <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">notice</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">attorney's fees provisions, choice of law, forum, and venue clauses, arbitration clauses, mandatory contractual acceptance clauses, requirements regarding changes</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the name of the work, and terms that require</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">effect,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">conveyed copies be governed by a license other than this License, are prohibited. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   c. Terms Added</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Removed</span> by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">deleting the notice</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">You. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">gives specific</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">copy, or from any part of it.  Some additional</span> permissions <span style="font-weight: bold;">require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Additional requirements are allowed only as stated</span> in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">addition</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">subsection 7b. If the Program as you received it purports</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">this License. Then</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">impose</span> any <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">broader permissions granted</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">other additional requirement, you may remove that requirement. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   You may place additional permissions, or additional requirements as allowed</span> by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">your terms which are not granted</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">subsection 7b, on material, added</span> by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">this License will not apply to their modifications, or</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">you</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the modified versions of your parts resulting from their modifications. However, the specific</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Adding</span> requirements <span style="font-weight: bold;">not allowed by subsection 7b is a violation</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">your terms will still apply</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">this License that may lead</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">whatever was derived from</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">termination of</span> your <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">added parts. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> Unless the work also permits distribution</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">rights</span> under <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a previous version of this License, all the other</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">section 8. </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   If you add</span> terms <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">included in the</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">to a covered</span> work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">under</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">in accordance with</span> this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">section</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">section, you</span> must <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">be listed, together,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">place,</span> in <span style="font-weight: bold;">the relevant source files,</span> a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">central list in</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">statement of</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.</span> 
</p>

<p>
 

   8.[4] Termination. 
</p>

<p>
   You may not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">propagate, modify</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">propagate</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">sublicense</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">modify</span> the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">propagate, modify</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">propagate</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">sublicense</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">modify</span> the Program is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">void, and</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">void.  If you violate this License,</span> any copyright holder may <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">terminate your rights under this License at any time after having notified</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">put you on notice by notifying</span> you of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">violation</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">violation,</span> by any reasonable <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">means within</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">means, provided</span> 60 days <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">of</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">have not elapsed since the last violation.  Having put you on notice, the copyright holder may then terminate your license at</span> any <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">occurrence.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">time.</span>  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as they remain in full compliance. 
</p>

<p>
   9.[5] <span style="font-weight: bold;">Acceptance</span> Not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a Contract.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Required for Having Copies.</span> 
</p>

<p>
   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive <span style="font-weight: bold;">or run</span> a copy of the Program.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.</span>  However, nothing else grants you permission to propagate or modify the Program or any covered works.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating the Program (or any covered work), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions. 
</p>

<p>
   10.[6] Automatic Licensing of Downstream Users. 
</p>

<p>
   Each time you <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">redistribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey</span> a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">propagate and</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">run,</span> modify <span style="font-weight: bold;">and propagate</span> that work, subject to this License, including any additional terms introduced through section 7.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights thus granted or affirmed, except <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(when modifying the work)</span> in the limited ways permitted by section 7. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License.</span>  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 
</p>

<p>
 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">11. Licensing</span> 
</p>

<p>

This patent license is nonexclusive, royalty-free and worldwide, and covers all</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">party's essential</span> patent claims <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">you control or have</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">in</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">right to sublicense, at</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">material that</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">time</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">party conveyed, against you, arising from your exercise of rights under this License. If</span> you <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute the</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey a</span> covered <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work or in the future, that would be infringed or violated by</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work, you similarly covenant to all recipients, including recipients of works based on</span> the covered <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work or</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work, not to assert</span> any <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">reasonably contemplated use</span> of <span style="font-weight: bold;">your essential patent claims in</span> the covered work.

   If you <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey</span> a covered <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work,</span> knowingly relying on a <span style="font-weight: bold;">non-sublicensable</span> patent <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">license,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">license that is not generally available to all,</span> you must <span style="font-weight: bold;">either (1)</span> act to shield downstream users against the possible patent infringement claims from which your license protects <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">you. </span>

<p>
   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey</span> the Program, or other covered work, so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey</span> it at all.  For example, if <span style="font-weight: bold;">you accept</span> a patent license <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">would not permit</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">that prohibits</span> royalty-free <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">redistribution</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">conveying</span> by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">all</span> those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribution. </span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other exclusive rights or to contest their legal validity.
