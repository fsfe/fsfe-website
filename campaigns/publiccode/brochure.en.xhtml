<h1 class="p-name">Brochure on "Public Money, Public Code"</h1>

<div class="e-content">

<div id="introduction">

<p>What is Free Software? How does it contribute to security and transparency of state digital infrastructure? Which steps can public administrations take? These and more questions are answered in our latest publication "Public Money Public Code â€“ Modernising Public Infrastructure with Free Software".</p>

<p>After launching the <a href="https://publiccode.eu">Public Money? Public Code!</a> initiative in 2017, the FSFE has received countless positive reactions from public bodies and state actors, but also a growing number of requests for more information about Free Software.</p>

<p>Therefore, we compiled one brochure summarising our own expertise and additional knowledge by top-class experts from other areas to help readers from politics and public administrations understand Free Software, its numerous benefits and how to make the first steps to a modern digital public infrastructure.</p>
