    <title>Microsoft: "Our software patents preclude interoperability"</title>
    <body>
Carlo Piana, Free Software Foundation Europe's lawyer on the case
explains: "The interventions made perfectly clear that the Blue Bubble
only existed in the lawyers' pleadings. Meanwhile, Microsoft left no

patents that it claims it holds on ADS, whose main effect is to
prevent interoperability and, eventually, competition."
