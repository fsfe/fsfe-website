FREE SOFTWARE CLAUSE

The Free Software Clause is an initiative of the Free Software Foundation which aims to promote the use and development of free software within all types of organizations.  Consequently, any organization finding itself in agreement with the principles of the Free Software Clause is invited to adopt it by inserting it inside its constitution or social contract.


Free Software Clause

Preamble
Part I - Software Usage Policy
Part II - Contribution Policy
Part III - Promotion Policy


Preamble 

WHEREAS humanity's knowledge is our most precious collective richness;  

Whereas knowledge which belongs to nobody in exclusiveness effectively belongs to all of humanity;

Whereas the intellectual property system cannot legitimately be applied to the scientific and technological knowledge that software is and that for profound ethical and technical reasons;

Whereas it is fundamentally immoral to prevent users from executing, copying, distributing, studying, modifying, and enhancing software freely;

Whereas the obstacles to economic and social development resulting from the criminalization of free and equitable distribution of software are real and costly;

Whereas proprietary software goes against all the principles enumerated above, we choose to support the use and development of free software within our organization, according to the following prerogatives:


PART I
SOFTWARE USAGE POLICY

Software usage policy
   
All computer programs used by our organization are free software.  In the advent where our organization would be obliged (see the Valuable Reasons) to make use of a non-free program, the following use conditions are applied:

Use conditions for non-free software

- From the moment a non-free software is installed within our free software systems, there must be a plan within our organization which aims to replace the latter by a free software equivalent.
- Others if necessary ( TO BE DEFINED )

Valuable Reasons for the use of non-free software

- There does not exist a free software providing the functionalities sought by our organization.
- There exists one or many free software programs capable of answering the particular needs of our organization, however there is no stable version currently available.
- Others if necessary ( TO BE DEFINED )

- Help in translating programs and documentation in the languages we know.
- Others if necessary ( TO BE DEFINED )


Insofar as our organization can allow it, we contribute to free software development efforts by providing:

- Voluntary developers
- Employees dedicated to free software
- Financial or material contributions
- Others if necessary ( TO BE DEFINED )


PARTIE III
PROMOTION POLICY
