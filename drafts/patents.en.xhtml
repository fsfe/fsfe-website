      This agenda lists events that involve a relation between the
      european or government officials and the european citizens on
      the subject of Software Patents. It deliberatly omits events
      such as meetings between european citizens, reports published by
      organizations but not sent to governmental agencies, public
      statements by european citizens that were not sent to
      governmental agencies. This decision was made to keep the agenda
      short and focused so that someone can quickly find out what
      happened on the subject of Software Patents and what are the
      upcoming milestones.
