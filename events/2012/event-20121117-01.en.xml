   <title>FSFE at JDLL in Lyon, France</title>
   <body>
   In November, FSFE will be present at the French event
   <a href="http://2012.jdll.org">JDLL</a> in Lyon, France.
   Every year, this event regroups organisations advocating Free Software and
   people giving talks over a complete week end in the center of Lyon. We'll be
   there the entire time from the 17th to the 18th. One of our interns, Léopold
   Baillard, will even be there the whole week if you want to meet with him.
   He will also give a talk about the Free Your Android campaign. The event takes
   place in <a href="http://www.salledesrancy.com/">Maison pour Tous - Salle des
   Rancy</a>. We are looking forward to see you there!
