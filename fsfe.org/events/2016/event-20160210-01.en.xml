		<title>Athens Free Software Monthly Meetup in Athens, Greece</title> 
 
		<body> 
			<p> This is our monthly meetup held in the Athens Hackerspace. 
			At this meetup we will discuss mostly around the two recent 
			events that many community members attended. 32c3 at Hamburg 
			and Fosdem at Brussels. We'll talk about new projects we 
			learned about on these events, highlights and best presentations 
			to watch. </p>
