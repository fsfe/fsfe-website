    <h1>“We are the FSFE”<br/><small>Testimonials from our community</small></h1>

    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
        FSFE is a charity dedicated to empowering users to control technology.
        Together with our community we form a movement to build freedom in
        digital society. There will never be enough space to shed light on all
        the creative minds and motivated people who helped us grow and share
        our mission. Still, we like to highlight at least some of our priceless
        community members who in one way or another shaped the FSFE's profile
        to help us become what we are now.
      </p>

      On this page you find diverse people from within the FSFE community,
      who are willing to let the world know what Free Software means to them.
      All of them left a testimonial, some answered an interview or even made
      a video. Enjoy getting to know our community!

              “I was a solitary voice for years, explaining the principles behind
              Free Software and its importance for people in my country in
              numerous articles and blog posts. I wanted to belong to an
              organization with the goal of building the digital society on 100%
              free software, and supporting the FSFE and gaining access to its
              infrastructure seemed like a logical first step.”

              “I am Cryptie, I am living in Paris, France. I used to be a
              cryptographer and now I am a privacy specialist. I consciously use
              Free Software for 15 years now. I discovered the FSFE randomly, I
              found the FSFE website and just loved this idea of
              counter-lobbying. I am a supporter of the FSFE for already 6 years
              now.”

              “I am a strong supporter of the ideas behind free software and a
              daily user of free software. I think a voice that explains why Free
              Software is good for society and what are the conditions under
              which the Free Software ecosystem can grow is vitally important. By
              joining FSF and FSFE, I wanted to say thanks to free software
              advocates and developers and help in maintaining political
              conditions that allow and favor free software development and
              use.”

              “If software is licensed as free software, we can audit it, and be
              sure that it does what it's intended to do (and nothing else).
              Public institutions develop software, and hire companies to make
              it, and the citizens should own and reuse all that code. I
              contribute to free software with translations, user help desk,
              finding free software alternatives at the University... but I
              cannot reach the policy-makers, nor people and institutions in
              other countries. I support the FSFE doing this task, and as one
              more way to say thank you to the free software community.”
