<h3>Version 1.1</h3>
<ul>
English: <a href="FLA-1.1.en.pdf">PDF(96k)</a><br />
</ul>

<h2>What is the FLA?</h2>

<p>The Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA) seeks to strengthen the legal
fundament of Free Software by allowing Free Software authors to make
the FSFE their fiduciary for all legal issues in the scope of its <a
href="/projects/ftf/">Freedom Task Force</a> activities.</p>

<p>This is in principle very similar to what the FSF North America has
been doing with its Copyright Assignments (CAs) for the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU Project</a> in order to secure the legal
fundament on which our operating system stands.</p>

<p>As some readers will know, the continental European "Droit
d'Auteur" (authorship right) tradition is in some parts significantly
different from the Anglo-American Copyright tradition.</p>

<p>Giving special attention to these differences, the Fiduciary
Licence Agreement offers a European approach to the same issues
handled by the Copyright Assignment mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Effect</h3>

<p>The effects of the Fiduciary Licence Agreement can be summarised as
follows:
<ul>
<li>Transferral of Copyright/Exclusive Exploitation rights to the FSFE</li>
<li>Re-Transferral of unlimited Usage/Single Exploitation rights to
the assigning party.</li>
<li>Safety clause: Should the FSFE ever use the transferred
rights for proprietary software, the assignment becomes void.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Authors</h3>

<p>The Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA) was written in cooperation
between RA Dr. Till Jaeger, Dr. Axel Metzger, Carsten Schulz (<a
href="http://www.ifross.de">ifross</a>) and <a
href="/about/greve/">Georg Greve</a> (<a
href="http://fsfeurope.org">FSFE</a>) in consultation with others who
take interest in the legal security of Free Software. At some time
involved in the process were Prof. Eben Moglen, RA Thorsten Feldmann,
LL.M., Werner Koch, Alessandro Rubini, Reinhard Muller and
others. Version 1.1 was by <a href="/about/greve/">Georg Greve</a> and
FSFE's <a href="/projects/ftf/">FTF</a> coordinator <a
href="/about/coughlan/">Shane M Coughlan</a> based on feedback
provided by Prof Lucie Guibault.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>The Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA) is Copyright 2002-2006 Free
Software Foundation Europe. Similar to the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a> (GPL), everyone is given permission to copy and distribute
it, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<p>If you wish to make the FSFE your fiduciary by filling out the
assignment, please contact the <a href="/projects/ftf/">Freedom Task
Force</a> for which you can also use the <a
href="https://roundup.fsfeurope.org/ftf/home?@template=entryform"
target="_blank">online contact form</a>.</p>

<p>For the legal security of Free Software, we hope to be able to
provide this service to as many projects as possible, but our
resources are limited by the support we receive in terms of <a
href="/help/help.html">volunteer contribution</a> and <a
href="/help/donate.html">donations</a>, so this will need to be
decided upon a case to case basis.</p>

<p>If you are another Free Software organisation that wishes to adopt
the Fiduciary Licence Agreement to increase the legal standing of your
own projects, please contact the <a
href="/projects/ftf/ftf.html">Freedom Task Force</a> for
cooperation.</p>

<p>Generally we will be glad to allow such uses, but we would like to
know what you plan and also to ask you to include a notice referring
to the source of the document.</p>

Licence Agreement (FLA) can be sent to <code><a

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>With growing popularity, Free Software also faces more and more
legal issues. Unlike proprietary projects, which tend to be owned by a
single company and thrown away after a few years, Free Software often
has many authors and is used for many years, some of the Free Software
programs in wide use are 10-20 years old or even older than that.</p>

<p>Making sure these programs will be legally safe to use and
defendable even after their authors are possibly nowhere to be found
or have even left planet earth is one of the issues the Free Software
community is facing.</p>

<p>Recently, we have also seen an increase in cases where authors of
Free Software were attacked solely on legal grounds to get him or her
to change the name of a software package or to stop distributing it
entirely. We as a community must find ways to defend our active
contributors against this.</p>

<p>Another issue is that more and more companies are running Free
Software projects and ask developers to give up their rights so these
companies can sell proprietary versions of that piece of Free
Software.</p>

<p>As management, company policy and markets are often subject to
drastic and rapid change, no company could ever guarantee to stick to
a certain policy for 20 years or more. Additionally, no company is
entirely safe from bankruptcy or buy-outs by other companies.</p>

<p>Also for this reason companies often don't trust each other to "do
the right thing" for a long time into the future.</p>

<p>The Fiduciary Licence Agreement will help with all these issues by
allowing the FSFE to take care of legal maintainability and protection
in the scope of its <a href="/projects/ftf/ftf.html">Freedom Task
Force</a>.</p>
