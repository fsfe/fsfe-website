    <body>
      <p>Our Policy Manager Alexander Sander will give a talk at the "openSUSE + LibreOffice Virtual Conference" (oSLO). On Friday, the 16. October 2020, at 16:30, Alexander Sander will talk about the advantages of using Free Software in the public sector, about the learnings from the corona crisis and why it is now even more important to use Free Software than ever before. In times when humanity needs to work together to find solutions for a crisis, we cannot afford to spend our time on reinventing the wheel. Global problems need global solutions! Free Software solutions developed in one country can be reused and adapted in another one. Publicly financed software developed for the public sector must be made publicly available under Free Software licences.</p>
