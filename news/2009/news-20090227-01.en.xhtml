<h1>FSFE engages in the EU browser case</h1>

<p>Free Software Foundation Europe today announces that it
will support the European Commission's antitrust investigation against
Microsoft and to this effect it has formally requested to be admitted as an
interested third party.</p>

<p>The investigation began on the 16th of January when the European Commission
DG Competition reported that it had issued a statement of objections regarding
Microsoft's abuse of web standards and the tying of Internet Explorer (IE) to
the Windows Operating System product family. It is based on a complaint
submitted by Opera, a European company involved in web browser development,
which FSFE publicly supported in 2007.</p>

<p>FSFE considers anti-competitive behaviour unacceptable, whether it occurs
through "tying" products, or in circumventing standards and fair access.  FSFE
will seek to support all processes that ensure competition and enable
innovation.</p>

<p>FSFE promotes freedom of choice and protects Open Standards. This includes
working against abuse of standards through proprietary extensions that
unlawfully segment the Internet. FSFE welcomes the participation of any company
in the browser market, including the optimisation of their products to work
well on target platforms.</p>

<p>But no company should be in a position to dictate what the Internet will
look like by leveraging platform dominance into erosion of standards through
control of server and client.</p>

<p>FSFE President Georg Greve comments: "Antitrust law has to step in when
there is consistent and massive abuse of a dominant position that is damaging
competition in other areas. In this case, Microsoft first used the platform
monopoly to create artificial ubiquity for Internet Explorer, and then modified
the standards on both ends to distort compatibility and competition."</p>

<p>"The design decisions that give IE better integration than alternative
browsers and to change web standards in undocumented ways were not
technologically justified. The consequences that made the intervention of the
European Commission necessary were intended, not accidental," Greve
concludes.</p>

<p>"Microsoft's pleas to be in favour of competition and interoperability must
be followed by real acts of goodwill," states Carlo Piana, counsel for FSFE.
"So far we have seen little of it: recent actions taken against Free Software
are eloquent. We will be restless in demanding that real competition be
restored and that all players are treated equally."</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>FSFE previously supported the European Commission's DG Competition in its
2001 investigation against Microsoft's non-disclosure of interoperability data.
This was the first time the Free Software community became involved in such a
case, and helped lead to a final decision in 2004 against Microsoft demanding
that interoperability information be made public.</p>

<p>The ruling was upheld by a 2007 ruling at the European Court of First
Instance, and eventually, Samba and the entire community received access to the
interoperability information upon conditions compatible with the GNU General
Public License, which is now being implemented into better and more
interoperable software that will benefit the entire IT ecosystem.</p>
