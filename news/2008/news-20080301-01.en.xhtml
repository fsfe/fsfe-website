    <h1>Google helps FSFE's Freedom Task Force to deliver training, attend conferences and translate documents</h1>

<p>Google has made a donation to assist FSFE's Freedom Task Force with
delivering training courses, attending conferences and localising
documents.</p>

<p>"The Freedom Task Force is working to foster effective legal
infrastructure for Free Software in Europe.  A great deal of our work is
based on engaging directly with people and Google's contribution will
allow us to do this more effectively," says Shane Coughlan, FTF
Coordinator.  "Training, physical presence in countries and providing
materials in local languages are essential aspects of building a
coherent pan-European community."</p>

<p>"Free Software Foundation Europe has been working to promote and protect
Free Software in Europe for many years and the Freedom Task Force is a
good example of their long-term approach to supporting the community,"
says Jeremy Allison, Member of the Technical Staff - Software Engineer,
Google.  "I believe that they are doing useful work and I'm proud to see
Google supporting their activities."</p>

<p>FSFE's Freedom Task Force helps individuals, projects and businesses
understand Free Software licensing and the opportunities that it
presents.  The activities of the FTF includes providing training
courses, consultancy and operating a European Legal and Technical
Network.  It fosters best practice throughout the European Free Software
community.</p>

<p>The FTF is operated on a non-profit basis under the auspices of Free
Software Foundation Europe.</p>

securing Free Software politically and legally, and giving people
Freedom by supporting development of Free Software are central issues
of the FSFE.</p>
