  We often underestimate the power of a simple <strong>Thank You</strong>. Free
  Software contributors do important work for our society and they deserve
  attention. The "I love Free Software Day" on 14 February (also known as
  Valentine's Day) is the perfect opportunity for you to express your special
  gratitude.

<p>
  In the Free Software community, we expect a lot of work from Free Software
  project maintainers. We want that our bug reports are dealt with quickly and
  demand new features from people who often spend their sparse volunteer time on
  Free Software code, translations, tests, or design. There is nothing wrong
  about this because constructive feedback helps us to further improve and keeps
  Free Software projects alive. But it is also important to show some
  appreciation to those who work so selflessly throughout the year for us! You
  can show your love for Free Software by saying thank you to your favourite Free
  Software project or contributor.
</p>

<p>
  The yearly "I love Free Software Day" allows you to make 14 February a day
  full of positive, creative and lovely messages for the whole community.
  Together, we can celebrate software freedom that empowers us.
