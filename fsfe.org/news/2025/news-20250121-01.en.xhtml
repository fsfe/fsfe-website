<h1>The FSFE launches 'Ada &amp; Zangemann' movie in French as Open Educational Resource</h1>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation Europe is releasing the animated film ‘Ada 
&amp; Zangemann - A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice 
Cream’ in French as an Open Educational Resource. Originally a highly 
successful illustrated book, now available in 10 languages and counting, 
the story has been adapted into a film that can be freely used in 
schools.

<p>Following the success of the illustrated book '<a 
href="https://ada.fsfe.org/">Ada &amp; Zangemann - Un conte sur les 
logiciels, le skateboard et la glace à la framboise'</a>, the FSFE is 
now releasing the story as <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/jPLeR3vpYE7zWaTYdsB9JU">an animated movie 
in French</a>, with the support of the French Ministry of Education.</p>

<p>
The story, aimed at children aged 6 and above, is about the inventor 
Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment 
with hardware and software, and in the process realises how crucial 
technology is for her and others. It is a fascinating and motivating 
story for children, especially girls, to tinker with hardware and 
software and encouraging them to shape their own technology.</p>

<p>
The movie is also available in <a
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/j1c6LQVZ8qnCLLwpXMuw3M">English</a> and <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/aw4EHJYVBSQGHPS22xXBG2">
German</a> and will be released in Spanish and Danish soon. It is 
distributed under a Creative Commons license, so <a 
href="https://ada.fsfe.org/movie"> anyone will be able to download and 
share the movie</a>, embed it on websites, use it in schools, display it 
at events, and integrate it with other educational material, making a 
difference to the quality of IT education that is so vital for young 
people in our digital society.</p>

<p>
The book has been translated into 10 languages, primarily by volunteers 
worldwide, and Ada’s story has reached more than 20,000 children 
globally. It has been shared through readings, discussions, and 
workshops. The <a 
href="https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/ada-zangemann/src/branch/main">FSFE's 
Git repository </a>provides access to the story in various languages, 
along with additional resources for educational purposes. For more
