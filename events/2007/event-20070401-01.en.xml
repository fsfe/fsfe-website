    <title>GPLv3: Improving a Great Licence</title>
    <body>
      On Sunday April 1st, at 17h00, in Brussels, Richard Stallman
      will present the current status of the global project to update
      Free Software's keystone licence: the GNU GPL.  This talk will
      be Stallman's first since the release of discussion draft 3 -
      the draft crafted to block patent deals such as that of
      Novell+Microsoft.  This draft has also been simplified, and the
      DRM (Digital Restrictions Management) and tivoisation clauses
      have also been altered significantly.
