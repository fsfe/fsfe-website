    <body>
        <p>
            This brainstorming workshop will be an opportunity to discuss how to
            incite and encourage the development of new technical bricks that
            play today the role of entry gates to contents or services content
            or services - browsers, mobile operating systems social networks -;
            how to enable privacy-protective solutions and standards to scale in
            order to benefit from the network effects that will allow them to
            develop; reflecting on the definition of desirable futures and the
            means to achieve them, etc. This workshop takes place on Thursday 10 March, 14:00-17:30 at Lieu de la Transformation Publique in Paris, France and it will be in French. It is open to people who are members of one of the FSFE central teams, and it is free of cost.
