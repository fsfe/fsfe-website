  A year-long public consultation is in progress for the drafting of
  version three of the GNU General Public License.  Free Software
  Foundation Europe is working to raise awareness of the proposed
  changes and to maximise public participation in the process.
  Information will be added here as it becomes available, and as we
  find what questions people have.  If you have a suggestion for
  information which should be here, please contact us.

<h2 id="intro">Introduction: What's happening</h2>

<p>
  On January 16th 2006, <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software
  Foundation (FSF)</a>, our sister organisation in the United States, published the first
  discussion draft of the GPL version 3 and launched a 12 month public
  consulation process.
</p>

<p>
  At the end of 2006, FSF will publish the updated the GNU General
  Public License.  This licence, commonly called &quot;the GPL&quot;,
  is by far the most used licence for <a
  href="/documents/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The task of the GPL is to ensure that everyone who receives a copy
  of GPL-licenced software is free to use that software, to modify it,
  and to redistribute it.  The number of people who use software which
  is distributed under the terms of the GPL is somewhere in the region
  of 100s of millions.
</p>

<p>
  Version 2 of the GPL was published in 1991.  Version 3 will do the
  same job as version 2 but will be updated to account for changes in
  software's legal and technical environment.
</p>





<h2 id="participate">How to participate</h2>
