      <p>With the end of support for Windows 10 (October 2025), many users and businesses are faced with the decision to discard good PCs or migrate to Windows 11, but not all PCs are compatible.</p>
     <p>Organized by Marco Crotta and Valentino Spataro, FSFE's volunteers and Linux professionals.</p>
     <p>Afterwards, the project Refund4Freedom will be discussed and the organizers will show how a PC with Linux works as well as how to stat using Linux on your PC.</p>
     <p>Join for this practical event on Thursday, 23 October 2025, from 18:00 to 20:00 at the Biblioteca Lambrate in Milano.The event is free but requires registration (few places available). Transportation is facilitated by the M2 Metro Lambrate station and the tram lines 19, 33, and bus 54.</p>
     <p>Participants must bring:<br/>
    Their own laptop loaded<br/>
    A USB flash drive</p>
     <p>With this, they will transform outdated hardware into a fast PC. The experts will show how Linux offers s tability, security, and efficiency, even on outdated PCs.</p>
     <p>IMPORTANT: backup all your data on an external disk (leave it at home), and also of emails, configurations, passwords, and software licenses on your PC. We will show you how to start live without modifying the PC, but if you want to install it, you must have all the data copied.</p>
