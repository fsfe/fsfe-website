<h1>The Netherlands: Important points for the election</h1>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is committed to empower 
users to control technolgy to digital civil rights, transparency and 
control over technology. It does this by promoting Free Software (also 
known as Open Source Software). In addition, Free Software promotes 
innovation and prevents vendor lock-in. Digital sovereignty is only 
possible with Free Software.</p> 

<p>Our society is becoming increasingly digital, so it is crucial that public values are also safeguarded in 
the digital domain. The upcoming elections and term of office are an 
opportunity to take important steps on current themes such as 
<strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> and <strong>digital commons</strong>.</p>

<p>FSFE asks parties to work on the following action points:</p> 

<ul> 
<li>Strengthen the 'open, unless' policy that requires government to 
choose Free Software by default This is crucial for transparency and 
digital sovereignty, so embed this policy in legislation. Support 
governments in selecting and developing Free Software with a central 
expertise center. Identify government tasks where control and 
explainability is necessary and ensure this by applying the principle 
of <a href="/activities/publiccode/publiccode.html">‘Public Money? Public Code!’</a>.</li> 
<li>Encourage wise reuse of software by investing in <strong>digital commons</strong> to 
make sure others can benefit from the improvements. Support the 
adaptation and development of these joint Free Software solutions with 
knowledge and financial resources. Use the European knowledge network 
and the space of European digitization funds for this.</li>
<li>Improve the oversight and transparency of <strong>algorithms</strong> in government use. The 
further filling of the national <strong>algorithm register</strong> is a first step in 
this respect. In addition, increase transparency by publishing the 
<strong>training data</strong> and <strong>source code</strong> of those algorithms under a Free license, 
<a href="/news/2022/news-20220330-01.html">as we have argued before</a>.</li> 
<li>Pupils and parents should not be forced to use proprietry software that often even 
spies on them. Place additional requirements on IT solutions for 
<strong>knowledge and educational institutions</strong> to help them maintain 
sovereignty in a digital world. Support institutions in the use of Free 
Software to prevent vendor-lock in and to promote independent digital 
skills.</li>
<li>Stop wasting energy and strategically important raw materials by 
<strong>extending the life of electronics</strong>. Make sure that the end of support 
does not mean the end of the service life. To this end, empower 
consumers and businesses to <strong>repair</strong> hardware and replace software with 
Free Software that they control themselves. This call has been 
supported by the signatories of <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/openletter.html ">our open letter 'The universal right to 
install any software on any device'</a>.</li> 
</ul>

<p>The FSFE is happy to elaborate on these points.</p>
