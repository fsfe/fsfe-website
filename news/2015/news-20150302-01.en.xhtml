<p newsteaser="yes">On Saturday, the 14 February, people all over the world
showed Free Software contributors their appreciation. It was the fifth year the
Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) asked people to participate at the “I
Love Free Software”-Day. This report shows a variety of different love
declarations that happened this day in blog posts, pictures, comics, a poem,
and a #ilovefs Android library. The FSFE thanks everybody who motivated Free
Software contributors.  For everybody who was not able to participate this
year, mark 14 February 2015 in your calendar for next year's “I love Free
Software”-Day.</p>

<h2>Your cryptovalentine and our defenders of privacy</h2>

<p>This year many people focused their activities on -- <a
href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/gerloff/2015/02/13/i-want-to-love-the-future-thats-why-i-love-free-software/">what
FSFE's president Karsten Gerloff described as</a> -- “powerful tools that help
us defend and regain the freedoms we’ve lost, and the ones we’ve given up”: Our
sister organisation encouraged people to ask someone they like -- romantically
or otherwise -- <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/will-you-be-my-cryptovalentine">to be
their “cryptovalentine”</a>. Besides like <a
href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/ao/2015/02/14/i-love-free-software-day-gnupg/">André
Ockers</a>, <a
href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/mk/i-love-free-software-thanks-to-all-the-gnupg-contributors/">FSFE's
vice president Matthias Kirschner</a>, and many others they expressed their
appreciation to all the hardworking Free Software contributors who work for our
privacy like GnuPG, Tor, Tails, Chatsecure and many others.</p>

<p>In their <a
href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/celebrating-ilovefs-why-eff-loves-free-software">bloq,
EFF explained why they love Free Software</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Without the freedom to fix security holes and share these
changes with others, nonfree software leaves computer users to fend for
themselves. Free software reintroduces a sense of solidarity amongst computer
users. Rather than developing a dependency on a single vendor, users are free 
to collaborate with others to add features and fix bugs. In contrast, changes
to proprietary programs depend on the whim of a program's
owner.”</p></blockquote>

<h2>A love poem</h2>

<p>In his blog post dedicated to the diagramming software “Dia”, <a href="http://nicorikken.eu/blog/dia-i-love-you/">Nico Rikken wrote a love poem</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Roses are red. Handles are green.<br />
You’re the finest diagramming software I have ever seen.<br />
Always there to help me out. And you ask nothing in return.<br />
Creating things together is all I really yearn.<br />
</p>
<p>
Dia I know we will be a great team.<br />
We can work together even upstream.<br />
So let this be my tag line:<br />
Would you be my Valentine?<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We hope all Free Software contributors out there received something that
motivated them. But maybe all the people who participated missed your favourite
Free Software program. That's not a bug, it's a feature! Add a reminder to your
calendar for next year's #ilovefs-day on 14 February 2015 and thank those who
have been forgotten this year.</p>
