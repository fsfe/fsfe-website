    <title>Free desktops for Europe's public sector</title>
    <body>
      <p>15 million civil servants in Europe are a huge group of
	      potential Free Software users. Today, there are hardly any
	      organisations that do not use at least some Free Software
	      somewhere in their systems. Yet only a tiny fraction of
	      public sector workers actually get to use Free Software
	      desktops. What is preventing greater adoption? And what
	      can we do to speed up the process? While several success
	      cases exist, the big breakthrough is still some way off. 
	      This is an area of key interest for the small and medium
	      enterprises that make up a large part of the Free Software
	      ecosystem.

        On the 8th of August, FSFE's president Karsten Gerloff will give
        a talk at the <a href="https://www.desktopsummit.org/program">Desktop Summit</a>
        in Berlin, Germany. The talk will explore usage of Free Software
        in the public sector and what is missing for it to take off.
