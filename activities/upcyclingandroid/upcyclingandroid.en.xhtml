  <h2 class="painted">About Upcycling Android</h2>

  <p>Every year, manufacturers produce 1.5 billion smartphones worldwide - and unfortunately, probably just as many are thrown away after what is usually a far too short hardware lifespan. E-waste increases every year. The energy required to produce the devices is extremely high, and the manufacturing and supply chain spans the globe several times. With Upcycling Android we go one step towards fixing the problem by extending hardware lifespan of Android devices in particular!</p>

  <h2 class="painted">Renew and keep using your phone with Free Software! </h2>

  <p>Every time we keep using our current phone instead of buying a new one we help avoiding the production of 
    new phones and growing disposal of e-waste. <strong>"Upcyling Android" is an initiative to tackle software obsolescence</strong> and to change our short-term  consumption from linear production of phones towards a circle economy. This by upcycling our devices with the use of Free Software. We explain the problem, offer help and make your voice heard by decision-makers.</p>

  <p><strong>Get active! Help the environment, save money, and use Free Software as a tool for self-determination, and against waste and obsolescence.</strong></p>

  <h2 class="painted">Overcoming software obsolescence with Free Software</h2>

    <p>So called <strong>"software obsolescence" occurs when the manufacturer of a software ends the support for a 
    current software</strong> so that no further support is provided and the subsequent version at the same time can no longer 
    be executed on the previous hardware. In this case, the manufacturer runs consumers into the dilemma of either 
    buying new hardware or to live with outdated software and potential security problems. Software obsolescence is a major concern throughout the Android world. We show you how to overcome the problem with the use of Free Software.</p>

    <div>
      <h3>Even when the software lags, hardware remains in good condition. </h3>
      <p>
	You may decide to change your device for many reasons. The 
	device becomes slow or non-responsive, or the manufacturing company 
	stops supporting its software, which could make it unusable and unsecure. In 
	most of these cases the hardware 
	still works pretty well. So why tossing away your 
	expensive hardware? Wouldn&#39;t it be better instead to update and 
	keep using it? That is what Upcycling Android is about!

      <h3>The software can be replaced.</h3>
      <p>
	  Phones can be modified. An operating system is a collection 
	  of software that enables you to use your phone and run 
	  applications on it. You do not need to stick to the default 
	  operating system. Instead, you can install a Free Software operating 
	  system on your phone.
      </p>

      <h3>Your device can perform better with Free Software.</h3>
      <p>
	How many apps were already on your phone the first time you turned 
	it on? How many of them are you actually using? How many of them 
	run advertisements you are not interested in? Unwanted software and 
	trackers often exhausts the battery and processing power of your 
	device. Switch to Free Software and take back control of your apps. 
	It is your device! Only install the apps you like and you will see 
	your phone performing better than before.

  <h2 class="painted">Take control and make your phone yours</h2>
  
  <p>
	Phones with Free Software operating systems 
	give you full control over your device. This way you have more control over how long to use and update the software on your device.

  <h3>Reclaim your phone</h3>
  
  <p>
	Replace the operating system of your phone with a Free 
	Software operating system. There are 
	several Free Software operating systems available which are 
	called "custom ROMs". Each custom ROM comes with different focus, 
	some focus on full user freedom, others on privacy, on usability and more. 
	Choose the one that matches your purpose best. Your phone will be 
	updated, upgraded and upcycled! Enjoy the feeling of a new operating system like 
	having a new device. 
  </p>
  
 
  <h3>Install Free Software apps</h3>

  <p>
	Even if you are still using your stock Android: Installing Free 
	Software apps is possible on any type of Android phone. You can simply 
	install <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> and immediately enjoy the biggest Free Software app 
	store in the Android world! Browsers, maps, games, music, chats and 
	more, everything in one place! Every app you replace with a Free 
	Software reduce your dependencies on non-free software.

<h2 class="painted">Join the movement</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Join the movement and upcycle your phone.</strong> Together we can make a difference and help to reduce our natural resource consumption as well as our CO2 footprint. Installing a Free Software operating system on your phone helps to keep your phone up to date. This way you have more control how long to use your device. In addition, it comes with a lot of other benefits. <strong>Free Software gives you full control over your device</strong>, you can finally de-install apps you could not before and you profit from extended privacy protection - just to mention a few.

      <h3>Do it yourself</h3>
      <p>Installing a Free Software operating system on your device technically translates to "flashing a custom ROM on your device". We explain the process and steps involved on our page about <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/howtoupcycle.html">how to upcycle your Android device</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Keep in mind that this might be not an easy task when you do it for the first time. 
	It needs some preparation and reserach in advance. There is however plenty of information and help available from diverse communitites. And if you like to tinker around with technology it can actually become quite some fun pretty soon.

      <h3>Participate in our workshops</h3>
  <p>
	  We organise <a 
	  href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/workshops.html">workshops</a> 
	  to show you how upcycling works and to connect like-minded people. Use one of our 
	  devices to learn how it works without any risk for your own hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
	  And if you are already an expert in installing custom ROMs, you 
	  are most welcome to help by sharing your skills with others. Feel 
	  free to <a href="mailto:contact@fsfe.org">contact us</a>.
