        <title>FSFE information stall on Veganmania Donauinsel in Vienna, Austria</title>

    <body>
      <p>Every year there are Veganmania summer festivals in Vienna. It is already a tradition that the local FSFE team takes part with an information stall. It usually is very well visited and reaches many people who aren't yet aware of free software and the ethical considerations that come with it. The Veganmania has been proven to be the best event by far in Vienna to inform many new people about software ethics because it is visited by people already used to think outside the box.</p>
      
      <p>The event takes place from 26th to 28th at &quot;Leuchtturmwiese&quot; on the &quot;Donauinsel&quot; in Vienna. Thousands of people usually come there to enjoy good food, sustainable products, interesting information stalls ... and of course the summer. There is no entry fee and people are invited to come at any time from Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon. Please drop by in case you want to talk about free software with us!
