        <title>Router Freedom: The hardware component of Net Neutrality in Aveiro, Portugal</title>

    <body>
      <p>Net neutrality refers to non-discrimination of internet communication. ISPs should  treat all internet communications equally, offering users and online content providers consistent rates irrespective of content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, source address, destination address, or method of communication. But what happens when they discriminate the type of routers and modems consumers use for internet connection? This talk explains why Router Freedom is key for achieving Net Neutrality, presenting the main finding of a recent survey the FSFE has conducted in the EU.</p>
      <p>Lucas Lasota, FSFE's Programme Manager Legal, will speak at "Festa do Software Livre" in Aveiro, Portugal, about Router Freedom. The talk takes place on 16.09. The language is Portuguese. The event is free and requires no registration.<br/>
