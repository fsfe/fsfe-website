  <h2 class="painted">About Upcycling Android</h2>

  <p><strong>Every year, manufacturers produce 1.5 billion smartphones worldwide - and unfortunately, probably just as many are thrown away after what is usually a far too short hardware lifespan.</strong> E-waste increases every year. The energy required to produce the devices is extremely high, and the manufacturing and supply chain spans the globe several times. With Upcycling Android we address the problem by extending the hardware lifespan of phones and Android devices in particular!</p>

  <h2 class="painted">Renew and keep using your phone with Free Software! </h2>

  <p>Every time we keep using our current phone instead of buying a new one we help avoid the production of new phones and the increase of e-waste. <strong>"Upcyling Android" is an initiative to overcome software obsolescence</strong> and to extend the lifespan of our hardware with the help of Free Software. Upcycling our devices this way is an important step to rethink our short-term, linear consumption of electronic devices in favor of a circular economy. We explain the connections, offer help and make your voice heard by decision makers.</p>

  <p><strong>Get active! Help the environment, save money, and use Free Software as a tool for self-determination and against waste and obsolescence.</strong></p>

  <h2 class="painted">Overcoming software obsolescence with Free Software</h2>


    <p>So-called <strong>"software obsolescence" occurs when the manufacturer of a device discontinues the support for 
    software</strong>, that is necessary to run the device properly.
    It becomes particularly problematic when a new version of the software is no longer supported and at the same time a supported successor version can no longer be executed on the existing hardware. In this case, the manufacturer runs consumers into the dilemma of either 
    buying new hardware or living with outdated software and potential security problems. <strong>Software obsolescence is a major concern throughout the Android world.</strong> We show you how to overcome the problem with the help of Free Software.</p>

    <div>
      <h3>Hardware often remains in good condition. </h3>
      <p>
      There are reasons why you might want to change your device. The 
      device might become slow or non-responsive. Or the manufacturer 
      discontinues support for the software and operating system, which can make the device unusable and unsecure. In 
      most of these cases, the problems are ultimately caused by software.
      The actual hardware still works
      pretty well. So why toss away your 
      expensive hardware? Wouldn&#39;t it be much better instead to <strong>update the software and 
      keep using your device</strong>? That is what Upcycling Android is about!
      </p>

      <h3>The software can be replaced.</h3>
      <p>
	  <strong>Phones and operating systems can be modified.</strong> An operating system is a collection 
	  of software that enables you to use your phone and run 
	  applications on it. However, you do not need to stick to the default 
	  operating system. You can install a Free Software operating 
	  system on your phone instead.

      <h3>Your device can perform better with Free Software.</h3>
      <p>
	How many apps were already on your phone the first time you turned 
	it on? How many of them are you actually using? How many of them 
	run advertisements you are not interested in? Unwanted software and 
	trackers often exhaust the battery and processing power of your 
	device. <strong>Switch to Free Software and take back control of your apps. 
	It is your device!</strong> Only install the apps you like and on top without ads. And you will see 
	your phone performing better than before.

  <h2 class="painted">Take control and make your phone yours</h2>
  
  <p>
	Phones with Free Software operating systems 
	give you full control over your device. This way you have more control over how long to use and when to update the software on your device.
  </p>

  <h3>Reclaim your phone</h3>
  
  <p>
	<strong>Replace the operating system of your phone with a Free 
	Software operating system.</strong> There are 
	several Free Software operating systems available in the Android world, they  are 
	called "custom ROMs". Each custom ROM comes with a different focus. 
	Some focus on giving users as much freedom as possible, others on their privacy, on usability, and more. 
	You can choose for yourself which operating system best suits your needs. Your phone will be 
	updated, upgraded, and upcycled! Enjoy the feeling of a new operating system, like 
	having a new device. 
  </p>
  
 
  <h3>Install Free Software apps</h3>

  <p>
	Even if you are still using your stock Android: <strong>Installing Free 
	Software apps is possible on any type of Android phone.</strong> You can simply 
	install <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> and immediately enjoy the biggest Free Software app 
	store in the Android world! Browsers, maps, games, music, chats and 
	more, everything in one place! Every app you replace with Free 
	Software reduces your dependencies on non-free software.

    <h4>Tired of replacing your phone every other year?</h4>
    <h3>Are you aware of the impact that growing phone production has on our climate?</h3>
  </div>

<h2 class="painted">Join the movement</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Join the movement and upcycle your phone.</strong> Together we can make a difference and help to reduce our natural resource consumption as well as our CO2 footprint. Installing a Free Software operating system on your phone helps to keep your phone up to date. This way you have more control how long to use your device. In addition, it comes with a lot of other benefits. <strong>Free Software gives you full control over your device</strong>; you can finally uninstall apps you could not before and you profit from extended privacy protection - just to mention a few.

    <div>
      <h3>Do it yourself</h3>
      <p>Installing a Free Software operating system on your device technically translates to "flashing a custom ROM on your device". <strong>We explain the process and steps involved on our page about <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/howtoupcycle.html">how to upcycle your Android device</a></strong>.</p>
	
	<p>Keep in mind that this might be not an easy task when you do it for the first time. 
	It needs some preparation and research in advance. There is however plenty of information and help available from diverse communities, in the Internet and locally. And if you like to tinker around with technology it can actually become quite some fun pretty soon.

      <h3>Participate in our workshops</h3>
  <p>
	  <strong>We organise <a 
	  href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/workshops.html">workshops</a></strong> 
	  to help each other in Upcycling Android devices and to connect like-minded people. Use one of our 
	  devices, get some experience to learn how it works without having to use your own hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
	  And if you are already an expert in installing custom ROMs, you 
	  are most welcome to help by sharing your skills with others. Feel
