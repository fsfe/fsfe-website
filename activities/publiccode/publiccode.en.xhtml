<p>Why is software created using taxpayers' money not released as Free Software? We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly available under a Free and Open Source Software licence. If it is public money, it should be public code as well. Code paid by the people should be available to the people!</p>

</div>

<p>The <a href="https://publiccode.eu">Public Money? Public Code!</a> campaign aims to set Free Software as the standard for publicly financed software. Public administrations following this principle can benefit from collaboration with other public bodies, independence from single vendors, potential tax savings, increased innovation, and a better basis for IT security.</p>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe together with over 170 civil society organisations and more than 26.000 individuals signed the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">Open Letter</a>. We will use the signatures to contact decision makers and political representatives all over Europe and convince them to make public code the standard. You are invited to <a href="https://publiccode.eu/#action">add your signature</a> to make a bigger impact!</p>
