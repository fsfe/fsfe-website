  <h2 id="general">General Questions</h2>

  <h3 id="basics">Tell me again: what is all of this about?</h3>

  <p>
    Youth Hacking 4 Freedom is a hacking competition for teenagers from all over
    Europe. You can submit software or other results of your hacking. The first
    3 places in each category will win money, and there will be a ceremony in
    Brussels (Belgium). All participants will be invited to a workshop to learn
    more. The submissions will be evaluated by a jury.

  <h3 id="hacking">Isn't hacking illegal?</h3>

  <p>
    Hacking is a word that is often misunderstood. It is not about breaking
    illegally into systems of other people, stealing money or so. Instead,
    hacking means that you think around the corner and make things with
    computers that are innovative, meaningful, interesting or just fun. It is
    about taking control over your technology and use it freely for your ideas.
