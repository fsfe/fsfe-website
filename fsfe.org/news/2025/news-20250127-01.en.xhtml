<h1>Join us at FOSDEM 2025!</h1>

<p>FOSDEM 2025 is almost here, and guess what? We want you to be, once
again, part of it! Mark your calendars for 1 and 2 February 2025. The
Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) will be there with a keynote on
our Apple court case, talks, devrooms, workshops, and of course, a booth
where you can meet us, chat and share ideas. Stop by and say hello!</p>

<p>As one of the most established Free Software conferences in Europe,
FOSDEM hosts thousands of developers and Free Software enthusiasts every
year, on the first weekend of February to meet, discuss the latest news
and updates about Free Software, and collaborate. As always, the FSFE
will be there with a booth, co-organizing two devrooms, and giving talks, like the
one from our Legal Programme Manager, Lucas Lasota, at the main FOSDEM
stage about ongoing legal battle to defend software freedom in the
European Union. Come around and check out our latest merchandising,
including hoodies, t-shirts, socks and get some stickers for your
devices! </p>

<p>We are organising social gatherings throughout the weekend—stay in
the loop, come by for a relaxed evening and great discussion while
making interesting connections! Join our <a
href="https://matrix.to/#/%23fosdem25:fsfe.org">FOSDEM Matrix Chat
Room</a> and be up to date with all the information.</p>

<h3>Friday, 31 January: Pre FOSDEM warming- up</h3>
<p>We will start starting the party early! If you are already in
Brussels on Friday, you can give us an extra hand in our booth set-up

<p>Once our booth is ready for Saturday, we will meet at <strong>La Mazzette</strong> at
19:00h., where we can have some drinks and some small treats. <a

<h3>Sunday, 2 February: Join us for the keynote speech, Upcycling your Android workshop, YH4F...!</h3>

<p>While we prepare for keynote speech later this day, by our
staffer Lucas Lasota who will talk about the FSFE intervention in the
Apple vs. European Commission case, we have several talks and events
beforehand.</p>

<p>One way is to start with the “<a

Upcycling Android Workshop</a>”, organized by Darragh Elliot, a former

Android ROM’s, this workshop is for you! Demonstration phones will be available.</p>

<p>Also in the morning, Bonnie Mehring, FSFE’s Project Manager will
explain our programming competition, <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4164-youth-hacking-4-freedom-2025/">Youth
Hacking 4 Freedom</a>, whose fourth edition is now open for
registration! <a href="https://yh4f.org">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</a> invites European teenagers aged 14
to 18 to showcase their creativity and programming skills. Participants
will have the opportunity to bring their project ideas to life.</p>

<p>Sunday is also the day of the second devroom that the FSFE is
co-organizing, a debuting one on <a 
href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/funding/">funding the FOSS 
Ecosystem</a>. Its
aim? To bring together developers, maintainers, policymakers,
entrepreneurs, donors and funders to explore various models and
mechanisms for funding that ensure longevity and security of FOSS
projects. <a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/funding/">Find
the schedule here</a>. 

</p>
<p>Just right after the closing of the Funding the FOSS Ecosystem
devroom, run to FOSDEM main stage, <strong>Room Janson</strong>, where at
<strong>16:00h.</strong> Lucas Lasota, FSFE's Legal Programme Manager,
will give a key speech about <em><strong><a 
href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5084-how-we-are-defending-software-freedom-against-apple-at-the-eu-s-highest-court/">“How 
we are defending
Software Freedom against Apple at the EU's highest
court”</a></strong></em>. In this keynote, Lucas Lasota will explain why
this case is pivotal for Free Software in Europe, and why we should all
care.</p>

<p></p>
<blockquote>The FSFE has been granted the right to intervene in the <a
href="/activities/apple-litigation/apple-litigation.html">Apple
vs European Commission</a> case at the Court of Justice of the European
Union, where Apple is trying to dodge its obligations as gatekeeper
under the Digital Markets Act. </blockquote><p></p>

say goodbye to FOSDEM 2025 in style.But first...<strong> after party 
packing!</strong> We hope to leave FOSDEM with as little merchandising 
as possible, but we’ll need some extra hands to help pack everything up 
on Sunday. If you can help us with booth tear down, please get in touch 
with our Office Assistant, Francesca, <email mailto="yes">fi@fsfe.or</email>. 
It’s always a challenge, but with a bit of teamwork, we’ll get it done 
in no time!</p>

<p>Once all is packed and tidy, it is time to meet at <strong>L'Ermitage 
Saint-Gilles</strong> at 19:00h. for a laid-back evening of 
conversation, drinks, and celebration. It’s a chance to unwind, meet new 
people, and reflect on the amazing time we’ve had. Here’s the <a
