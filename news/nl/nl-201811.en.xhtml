		<h2 id="softwarefreedomineurope">Software Freedom in Europe</h2>

		<p>For 17 years, the FSFE has been empowering people to have control over their technology, and we get better at it every year. To help you understand how we work and what we do, we have just published <a href="/news/2018/news-20181105-01">"Software freedom in Europe"</a>, the yearly report about the FSFE and our activities.</p>

		<p>The report gives you a breakdown of important things the FSFE has achieved during the last 12 months in one document. In the 2018 report, you will read about several campaigns, our input on the European Union's copyright reform, and about our successful outreach in demanding publicly financed software be made publicly available under a Free Software licence. You will also get insights about the multiple events we (co-)organised, about our community and groups that helped us with these achievements. Finally, we will display some numbers showing what resources we counted on, and giving an outlook for the next year.</p>

		<p>If you like our report, please share it on your favorite (social) media channels and mailing lists, among your colleagues, friends and families.</p>

		<li>In the third consecutive year, the FSFE coordinators Spain were running a booth at OSHWDem, a fair about Free Software and free hardware. On this occasion, the creation of a FSFE local group in Northern Spain was announced, as well as a translation team for the Galician language. If you are interested to join one of them, please get in contact with <a href="mailto:pd@fsfe.org">Pep Diz</a>.</li>

		<li>At this year's Linux Day Italy, the FSFE Local Group Sicilia <a href="https://linuxday.thefreecircle.org/2018/en/">hosted an event</a> with Giuseppe Bonocore, member of FSFE local group Milano, who gave an introduction about the FSFE and the state of the art of Free Software for "Microservices, dev-ops and silverbullet". At the same time, the FSFE local group Milano was also <a href="http://linuxdaymilano.org/2018/">hosting an event in Milano</a> about Free Software and open source culture, together with local associations where Stefano Costa gave a talk about "Libera il tuo router!"

		<li>Björn Schießle writes about his <a href="https://www.schiessle.org/articles/2018/11/01/keep-yourself-organized/">set-up of Zim</a>, and how that helps him keep being organised. </li>

		<li>Diderik van Wingerden <a href="http://think-innovation.com/blog/reinventing-startups/">proposes an alternative entrepreneurial-based innovation model</a> that he believes has the potential to be good for people and the planet by design. </li>
