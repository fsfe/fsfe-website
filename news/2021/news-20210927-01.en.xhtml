<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>

  <p>
    From Monday 1 November 2021, a five-month coding phase starts and 
    the participants focus on coding until March 2022. Participants can 
    bring in all their imagination to the competition; they can code 
    any type of software they want, as long as it is Free Software. The 
    software project can be a stand-alone program written from scratch, 
    or you can modify and combine existing programs. Everything is 
    welcome! The participants will have the chance to briefly follow 
    each other’s work and exchange ideas.
  </p>
  
<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
  
  <p>
    After the participants submit their programs, an evaluation phase 
    is carried out by Free Software experts. Our <a 
    href="/activities/yh4f/evaluation.html">jury 
    members</a> excel in software development; among them are Neil 
    McGovern, Executive Director of the GNOME Foundation, and Claudia 
    Müller-Birn, Professor for Human-Centered Computing at the Freie 
    Universität Berlin.
  </p>

<h3 id="awards">Awards</h3>

  <p>
    The winners will be invited to receive their awards during a trip 
    to Brussels in June 2022. The 2-day trip includes the Award 
    Ceremony and social activities where the winners will have the 
    chance to get to know each other better.
