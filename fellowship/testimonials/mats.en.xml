            I joined as a Fellow since I wanted to support FSFE's work to promote
            free software. As a person that uses computers quite heavily every
            day, I'm very concerned with the current trend of locking down
            computing which is taking control away from the users. This is
            increasingly problematic since people's lives are more and more
            dependent on computers for personal communications, managing finances,
            employment, etc. Free software is a necessary requirement for
            retaining control over your computing.
