The Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee (IMCO) today 
launched a landmark decision to protect Free Software developers in the 
Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). In September last year, the EU Commission 
presented the CRA. The proposal to exclude Free Software “outside the 
course of a commercial activity” would fail to address a large part of 
software that will not be covered but is deployed. Furthermore, smaller 
and non-profit projects would be harmed as they would have to bear 
major costs. We, therefore, <a href="/news/2023/news-20230323-01.html">proposed a solution</a> 
that will lead to more security while safeguarding the Free Software ecosystem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Liability should be shifted to those deploying Free Software instead of those developing Free Software and</li>
<li>Those who significantly financially benefit from this deployment should make sure the software becomes CE-compliant</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
 <em>Alexander Sander, FSFE Senior Policy Consultant explains: 
 <italic>"The Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, a 
 committee for opinion in CRA, has backed our demand and voted for the 
 protection of Free Software developers in the Cyber Resilience Act. We 
 are particularly delighted with the transfer of those protections into 
 an article and the precise description of how Free Software should be 
 protected in the future. The lead committee is now called upon to 
 follow this vote"</italic>.
</em> 
</blockquote>


<p>Shortly, the leading committee, Committee on Industry, Research and 
Energy (ITRE), will define its position and submit it to the plenary 
for a vote. After that, the trialogue with Parliament, Council and 
Commission will begin in order to reach a final agreement. At the same 
time, similar rules are being negotiated in the Product Liability 
Directive (PLD). Here, too, FSFE is calling for <a href="/news/2023/news-20230323-01.html">the protection of 
developers of Free Software</a>. We thank all those organisations and individuals contributing to this position and making sure to safeguard Free Software in those files.
