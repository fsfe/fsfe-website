        <title>REUSE: Simple steps to declare your copyright and licenses (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>Max Mehl, Programme Manager, will be giving a presentation about REUSE in "REUSE: Simple steps to declare your copyright and licenses" on Sunday, 21 March 2021, from 16:10 CET to 16:55 CET, at the LibrePlanet 2021 conference. In this presentation Max Mehl will talk about how Free Software licensing can be made easier with the REUSE initiative. Through software licensing developers are setting the conditions for the use and reuse of their code. In three easy steps, you can make sure that all files are labelled clearly. No matter how complex you project is, REUSE keeps you covered. With the additional documents and tools, you can increase the time you spend coding. Join the session to learn about the principles and see a live demo of how we make a project REUSE compliant. Registration for the LibrePlanet 2021 conference is required.</p>
