	  The FSFE plays an important role in contributing to balanced public
	  discourse and policy discussion in areas that underpin core EU values
	  (e.g. the fundamental right to privacy) - areas that are important to
	  all Free Software enthusiasts, but are often neglected or
	  underrepresented by technologists, while providing important checks
	  and balances for commercial lobbying interests. Through grassroots
	  initiatives such as 'Public Money, Public Code', the FSFE also raises
	  awareness of critical issues concerning the public benefit of
	  government-funded research & innovation activities, highlighting key
	  gaps and tensions between the European Commission's pursuit of
	  societal benefit and reuse of publicly-funded research results with
	  the intellectual property-driven market reality. These kinds of
	  initiatives allow ethically minded companies to become more
	  proactively involved in the debate while helping to shape their own
	  business strategies and values for the future.
