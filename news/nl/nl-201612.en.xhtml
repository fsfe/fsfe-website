This year, the FSFE celebrated its 15th birthday. 15 years of empowering users, supporting communities, and pushing for better legislation. 15 years during which we saw that all activities, even if considered small at the time, can become big when we work together. 15 years during which we saw that that all activities, even if considered impossible at the time, can succeed when we stand together. Together, we have even succeeded against the heaviest lobbying of large interest groups. All of this would not have been possible without the continuous support of our community, contributing thousands of hours of their work time and backing us financially. If you are a frequent reader of our newsletter, and you like our work but you are not yet part of our community ... then consider joining the FSFE!

Russian Bill makes Free Software a Public Priority
</h2>
<p>
In mid October, the
<a href="/news/2016/news-20161110-01">
lower chamber of the Russian Federation ("Duma") approved a bill that will boost Free Software on multiple levels within the Russian Federation's public sector</a>. It requires 
the public sector to prioritise Free Software over proprietary alternatives, 
gives precedence to local IT businesses that offer Free Software for public tenders, 
and recognises the need to encourage collaboration with the global network of Free Software organisations and communities.
</p>
<p>
The legislators made an extra effort to ensure a proper use of language. The bill talks about "Free Software", explicitly mentions the four freedoms and even uses "GNU/Linux" to refer to the most widespread free operating system.
</p>
<p>
As our Policy Analyst Polina Malaja puts it: "The bill is an example of public software procurement done right."

At the beginning of October there was the annual meeting of
<a href="/about/team#general-assembly"> the General Assembly of the FSFE</a>. On 
this occasion Mirko Böhm, our current Fellowship representative, managed to untie the knot that was around our ideas to start evaluating "Free Software business". The genius might lie in not evaluating the companies but rather their activities. Matthias Kirschner summarised the whole background in his blog
<a href="https://k7r.eu/there-is-no-free-software-company-but/">"There is no Free Software company - But!" </a>
and asks for feedback.
</li>
<li>

asking the political parties for the state's election in Berlin about their plans regarding the use and spread of Free Software
</a>
and
<a href="/activities/elections/askyourcandidates/201610-germany-berlin-handlungsempfehlungen">
sending them three recommendations for actions (DE)</a>, we have now
<a href="http://blog.3rik.cc/2016/11/die-neue-berliner-koalition-und-freie-software-zwei-schritte-vor-einer-fehlt-noch/">
published an analysis of the coalition agreement of the new government in the state of Berlin (DE)</a>.</li>

Erik Albers, the FSFE's community builder, tried to reach out and localise
<a href="/contribute/spreadtheword#nocloud"> our noCloud slogan</a>
with translations from all over the world. With the amazing help of Olga Gkotsopoulou, crowdsourcing went pretty well and in our wiki
<a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Migrated/KnowledgeBase/PromotionMaterial/noCloud">
we now have almost 40 translations in several languages and dialects, from Japanese, Breton and Arabic, to Luxembourgish and Swabian</a>. Erik summarised this activity
<a href="http://blog.3rik.cc/2016/11/localizing-our-nocloud-slogan/">
and ways you can still contribute to the noCloud translations</a>. We hope 
to use these translations to offer our favorite sticker in your own language or dialect soon.

For everyone working with the FSFE website, like the web team or many translators, Max Mehl wrote a
<a href="https://blog.mehl.mx/2016/build-fsfe-websites-locally/">
