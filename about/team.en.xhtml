    <h1>The FSFE Team</h1>

    <p>
      These people are working for and with the FSFE on a regular basis,
      so they have been given permanent responsibilities and authorities for
      certain areas.

        <h2 id="council">Council</h2>

        <p>
          Here you can find people working on day to day tasks of the

          as the members of the <a href="/about/legal/legal.html">legal
          association</a>. You can either see everyone working in these groups,
          or see a selection.
