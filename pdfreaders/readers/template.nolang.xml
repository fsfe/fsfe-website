<!--
 When setting up a new reader for display, you can use this file as a template

 svn cp template.nolang.xml newreader.en.xml
 Use a single reader definition per file. You can have different language
 versions of each file. Just change the .en. in the filename and adjust
 the content accordingly.

 Here is an explanation of the fields to fill out.

<!-- For historical reasons: the top level xml element in a file can be arbitrary, but
     I recommend, to choose "readers". The second level element is important as it will
     be processed by the build system.
     The element name must be "reader", the priority indicates at which position the
     reader is displayed on the website (higher number means further down the list).
     Readers are allowed to have identical priorities, in which case their relative
     position toward each other will be undetermined. 
     Initially we set the priorities in steps of 10, starting at 10 for the first in
     the list.

       If the projects keeps the download links for different platforms on one page, it is OK
       to link to this page multiple times.
       Preferably you should not link to the download file directly, but rather to a web page
       containing the download links.
       For pages in multiple languages, apply the same rules as with the home page.
