      <p>Every year, 1.5 billion smartphones are produced worldwide are manufactured and thrown away after an often short period of use. We can help to reduce electronic waste if we continue to use our current phone instead of buying a new one. If just one in three people used their cell phone for 1 year longer, the raw materials for the production of 100s of millions of cell phones could be saved. </p>
     <p>With Upcycling Android the Free Software Foundation Europe shows how, with the help of free software operating systems, phones can be given a second life. Phones will also be provided to try these free software operating systems out or can be flashed by the participants themselves. In the meantime, we will answer questions about flashing and try to help participants with flashing their own phones.</p>
