    <title>FSF Europe present at first LiLit meeting</title>
    <body>
      <p>On Friday 26 April 2002, the Free Software Foundation
              Europe will be present at the first LiLiT meeting in
              Li√®ge, Belgium.  During this evening (night ?-) session,
              we will focus on the best means to explain the ethical
              value of Free Software. A global view of the on going
              actions will hopefully allow everyone to figure out how
              to promote and defend the Free Software ideals.
