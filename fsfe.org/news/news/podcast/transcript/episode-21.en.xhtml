00:00.000 --> 00:19.520
Hello and welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast. This podcast is presented to you by

00:19.520 --> 00:24.840
the Free Software Foundation Europe. We are a charity that empowers users to take control

00:24.840 --> 00:30.280
of technology. I'm Bonnie Merring and our guest for today's episode is Lina Ceballos.

00:30.920 --> 00:36.600
Lina is part of the FSF East Legal and Policy Team. She actively coordinates a

00:36.600 --> 00:43.000
Reuse Initiative and contributes to the Public Money Public Code campaign. In this episode,

00:43.000 --> 00:49.080
we will dive into Lina's activities and engagement at the European level. Hair cloth monitoring

00:49.080 --> 00:55.400
of the legislative process within the European institutions enables her to actively participate

00:55.400 --> 01:01.560
in discussion with decision makers and strengthen the position of free software within new acts

01:01.560 --> 01:06.360
and policies. For this episode, we will talk about the Interoperable Europe Act.

01:07.480 --> 01:12.920
Lina will share her insights on the act and also explain the importance of our clear free

01:12.920 --> 01:19.080
software first since within the Interoperable Europe Act. Welcome to the podcast, Lina. I'm so

01:19.080 --> 01:25.000
glad to have you here. Thank you so much. Hi, Bonnie. Thank you very much to you for the invitation.

01:25.560 --> 01:29.480
Lina, I was wondering what's your favorite part about free software?

01:32.040 --> 01:38.760
I think what I like the most about free software is how actually empowers people.

01:39.640 --> 01:46.440
In many ways, of course, to control the technology they use. But I feel like in general,

01:46.440 --> 01:56.680
empowers people to own their software, their data, and basically the digital world we live in now

01:56.680 --> 02:03.400
at the moment. Awesome. Thank you so much. So you and I, we have been working together for the

02:03.400 --> 02:12.360
FSFE for now quite a long time, at least some years. You do a lot of policy work for the FSFE.

02:13.160 --> 02:17.480
Among other initiatives, you have been involved with public money public code,

02:17.480 --> 02:23.240
and you have also done a lot of policy work on an European level. Can you tell me a bit about

02:23.240 --> 02:30.840
your work for the FSFE? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I like to maybe start to say that,

02:31.320 --> 02:37.080
yeah, I feel like I've been involved a lot with the public money public code mainly because we

02:37.080 --> 02:44.440
believe that it's a framework that we always use to work in other activities and these are the

02:44.440 --> 02:50.600
arguments that we pretty much always bring on the table whenever we do a policy work.

02:52.040 --> 02:58.680
But yeah, maybe to focus a little bit more on the European level. So yeah, for the last month,

02:58.680 --> 03:04.680
I've been working a lot on the policy area mainly on the European level. And this means that we

03:04.680 --> 03:13.240
monitor and we identify first what kind of digital policies are about to be introduced or have

03:13.240 --> 03:21.080
been recently been introduced by the European Commission. And that might have an effect on users

03:21.080 --> 03:27.640
and or the free software as a whole as an ecosystem. And depending of course on our resources,

03:27.640 --> 03:32.920
then we decide to step in in some of them. So we like to all we have to pick out fights.

03:33.960 --> 03:41.080
So maybe to give a very brief overview of the legislative process in the EU level,

03:41.080 --> 03:44.440
I think that makes also easier for me to explain a little bit what we do.

03:45.320 --> 03:52.680
So basically, the European Commission proposed a legislation because this is the institution

03:52.680 --> 04:00.120
that has such power to introduce and to propose new legislation. And then after the Commission does

04:00.120 --> 04:05.480
this, then the text goes to the European Parliament and also to the Council. And then at the same time,

04:05.480 --> 04:11.800
then they just come up with their own text. So in the end, we will have kind of like three different

04:11.800 --> 04:17.720
texts, one from the Commission, one from the Parliament and one from the Council. And then after

04:18.040 --> 04:22.280
the Council and the Parliament are done with their texts, then they sit together together with

04:22.280 --> 04:28.440
the Commission and then they come up with the final text, which if it's adopted, then that's

04:28.440 --> 04:34.120
considered low and then there is implementation phase in member states and so on. But this is more or

04:34.120 --> 04:43.880
less the kind of overview of the whole legislative process. So what we do is that we try to step in

04:43.960 --> 04:49.560
as early as possible. So usually before the Commission proposed something, there is already a consultation

04:49.560 --> 04:55.560
phase. So we try to participate in consultations from the Commission. Quickly let me cut in there.

04:55.560 --> 05:02.120
So you take a look at like all the proposed ideas that are floating around and you're saying,

05:02.120 --> 05:08.040
oh, this sounds very interesting. This is a topic that could protect user freedom and that's

05:08.040 --> 05:14.440
important for software for software freedom. Exactly. Then you say, okay, this is now the consultation

05:14.440 --> 05:22.920
phase. Now we step in and we try to implement free software or we try to protect free software.

05:23.560 --> 05:30.120
Exactly. From the very beginning, even before the Commission proposed something, because I mean,

05:30.120 --> 05:34.280
in the end, once the Commission proposed, then that's already the final text from the Commission.

05:34.280 --> 05:40.520
So what we try to do is also to participate in such phase from the Commission part in the

05:40.520 --> 05:46.760
consultations. And as you said, then we try to identify maybe, of course, we're trying to follow

05:46.760 --> 05:54.120
that digital policies. And then in that regard, then if we see that this might be a legislation that

05:54.120 --> 06:01.000
can actually help to protect users and to enhance free software freedom, then we step in.

06:01.080 --> 06:05.800
But also, on the other way around, if it's actually undermining software freedom or if it's

06:05.800 --> 06:10.040
actually going against this, then we also step in. Actually, maybe in this case, this is more

06:10.040 --> 06:16.280
necessary to step in as well. Do you see a lot of those like undermining software freedom or

06:17.560 --> 06:25.080
because I like with author and all the work that there's done for software freedom on an European

06:25.080 --> 06:31.240
level, I sometimes have to feeling, oh, yeah, this is going to be great. But then on the other hand,

06:31.240 --> 06:37.640
I also hear old free software is not considered this act and there. And we need to work on that.

06:37.640 --> 06:44.280
So what you say keeps the balance or I mean, in this case, since we're now we're talking about

06:44.280 --> 06:48.840
the Commission, I would say there has been an improvement over the last years. I mean, they already

06:49.560 --> 06:56.600
have an open source strategy. So I feel like over the last eight years, the Commission has been

06:56.600 --> 07:02.680
aware of the role that free software can play in digital policies. And I mean, in general,

07:02.680 --> 07:09.160
the digitalization of Europe. However, I would say most of the times these documents come with some

07:09.160 --> 07:17.400
blue holes. So I wouldn't say the perfect they need some improvement. And of course, with new

07:17.400 --> 07:26.280
technologies such as the AI or this new technologies that I popping up, then there is even more

07:26.280 --> 07:31.960
to catch up, I would say. But yeah, but just to answer your question, I would say in general,

07:32.520 --> 07:38.600
the Commission is pretty aware of free software. Makes it just easier to talk to them or is it

07:38.600 --> 07:46.280
like still quite hard to get your points across? I mean, in this case, then I would say,

07:47.320 --> 07:54.840
I mean, we engage also in like with the Commission. And we try to because in the end, they are the

07:54.840 --> 08:01.000
ones that have a very overview of the whole process because they participate in the parliament

08:01.000 --> 08:08.520
discussions as well as on the council discussions. So they have a very overview of where this is going

08:08.680 --> 08:17.080
kind of or the legislation is going. However, once they propose, then that's their text. So there

08:17.080 --> 08:25.160
is nothing else to do there, rather than just keep pushing your demands in more like, yeah, we just

08:25.160 --> 08:30.600
by talking to them and so on. But in this case, once the Commission proposed something, then we try

08:30.600 --> 08:35.480
to focus on the million the parliament because I mean, the European parliament is one of the

08:35.480 --> 08:40.200
parliament that is the most transparent, I have to say. So you can basically

08:42.440 --> 08:50.280
as for documents, you can see, you can attend debates, you can see the discussion, you can

08:50.280 --> 08:55.640
it's pretty transparent. So it's also pretty easy to, I wouldn't say pretty easy, but it's way

08:55.640 --> 09:05.240
easier to influence and to advocate with the parliament. So I think in this case, we try to

09:05.240 --> 09:10.840
concentrate in in the parliament and also because after the Commission proposed the text, then

09:11.480 --> 09:16.040
it's on the parliament and the council to come up with a new text as well, if they think it has to

09:16.040 --> 09:23.320
be improved. So I think this is where the room for improvement is actually. All right. What is the

09:23.320 --> 09:28.680
part you like most about just very like it sounds like a lot of talking with a lot of people

09:29.480 --> 09:34.920
and sometimes I had imagined it's quite hard to keep track of all the conversations and

09:35.400 --> 09:43.880
yet to stay informed about all the ongoing. So I do think it's quite a lot to do, but what's the

09:43.880 --> 09:51.960
part you like most about it? Yeah, definitely is a lot of talking. So please also interrupt me if

09:51.960 --> 09:59.800
you feel like I'm talking too much because I'm like to talk. Yeah, but I mean, I really feel like

09:59.800 --> 10:04.840
in general, what I like the most about my job is that I feel that I'm doing something good

10:05.560 --> 10:13.960
for society, which in the end is what it really matters to me and then just like to go more into

10:13.960 --> 10:20.920
details than I really like this. I feel like the whole process of advocating in the EU level is

10:20.920 --> 10:26.680
just fascinating because you have to meet people that sometimes you are not really aligned with

10:26.760 --> 10:34.840
in terms of political ideologies and so on, but you just keep neutral because you have to keep

10:34.840 --> 10:40.520
the focus on what you're doing, which is in this case advocate for software freedom, for free

10:40.520 --> 10:47.720
software and beyond that, there is nothing else, right? So that makes it so kind of easy to talk to

10:47.720 --> 10:54.760
people that you would, I mean, at least that I would have thought that I would actually sit down

10:54.840 --> 11:02.040
and have a talk, right? And in this case, you have to try to convince as many people as you can

11:02.760 --> 11:08.920
and I have to feel that it's more fun to convince those that actually think the opposite

11:09.640 --> 11:18.120
than actually the ones that are already on board with you. So I think that makes it more fun.

11:19.400 --> 11:23.560
And I also have to say that it's super nice to see that something that you have worked on,

11:23.960 --> 11:31.320
like working that you have worked on, I suggest, is included in some of these documents. So

11:31.320 --> 11:39.880
it's really nice to feel that you kind of part of the whole democratic process, I would say.

11:40.520 --> 11:46.040
Awesome. Yeah, I can imagine it. I think it's quite fascinating to do it like that, yeah.

11:47.000 --> 11:54.120
Yeah, yeah, it's definitely, and I mean, I also know I think that I actually enjoy a lot is to

11:55.400 --> 12:01.160
kind of serve as a bridge between decision makers and the free software community and trying to

12:01.160 --> 12:06.920
make them speak with one another and to understand one another. Because sometimes I feel that they don't

12:06.920 --> 12:12.360
really, or sometimes they don't completely understand each other. So when you kind of translate

12:12.920 --> 12:18.280
the language from the free software community into decision makers and the other way around,

12:19.080 --> 12:24.040
then it feels it is nice to know that these two important communities are

12:24.680 --> 12:29.080
understanding each other. And you're like bringing them closer together.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.080
Yeah, I like to be distant.

12:33.080 --> 12:41.160
I see. Okay, back to the EU and European politics.

12:41.960 --> 12:47.800
What are currently the proposals you think the free software community should watch out for

12:47.800 --> 12:49.880
to ensure the protection of free software?

12:50.600 --> 12:57.080
Oh, that's a hard question. And if you don't want me to talk more than one hour, maybe let's try

12:57.080 --> 13:04.600
to get focused. But yeah, I mean, I think right now, it's really interesting to see how many

13:04.600 --> 13:11.000
digital policies are coming up or come out. And I think, I mean, I would just mention some,

13:11.160 --> 13:17.720
but I think at least from from my perspective, I would like to focus on maybe just one.

13:17.720 --> 13:23.320
So right now we have seen like over the last I think two years, then there is the ongoing AI act

13:24.120 --> 13:30.280
where we have been also quite active there. And recently last year, specifically the Cyber

13:30.280 --> 13:37.480
Resilience Act. And with this, the product liability directive, which are mainly focused on

13:37.480 --> 13:45.000
liability and free software. But also at the moment, then we have the Interoperable Europe Act,

13:45.000 --> 13:53.080
which it's also, in my perspective, a super important topic and a super important regulation

13:53.080 --> 13:59.720
that is not really catching up the attention that much as the CRA and the PLD, like the product

13:59.800 --> 14:07.640
liability directive. So yeah, why do you think this is the case that the CRA and the IA act have

14:07.640 --> 14:15.000
catched or caught a lot of attention? Yeah, I mean, I just feel that, I mean, for sure, I feel like

14:15.000 --> 14:20.600
in general AI is taking a lot of attention at the moment. And I understand why, because it is

14:21.400 --> 14:28.280
indeed a super complex technology. And I feel like the more people keep their eyes on it, then

14:28.280 --> 14:33.880
the more kind of noise it makes and the more, yeah, people are aware of it, so to say.

14:35.160 --> 14:41.160
So I feel like a lot of people are now interested in AI and regulating these technologies.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.640
And I mean, with the CRA, I think it's all at least in the free software communities,

14:45.640 --> 14:51.640
because it was the way it was proposed and it had some conflicting

14:52.520 --> 14:57.720
wording and a lot of people noticed. So it really became a huge topic.

14:58.520 --> 15:02.760
But again, nonetheless, I feel like the Interoperable Europe Act is, it's so important,

15:03.480 --> 15:08.520
because it really, I mean, it's going to try to regulate how public administrations

15:08.520 --> 15:13.320
offer digital public services to citizens. So I think this is also quite important,

15:13.320 --> 15:17.720
although it's not AI by, but it is an important topic.

15:21.320 --> 15:25.160
I do believe it is an important topic as well, just to clarify that beforehand.

15:25.720 --> 15:31.480
But before we dive into the importance of it, could you quickly explain

15:32.280 --> 15:37.560
what it is about? Like what's the Interoperable Europe Act?

15:38.280 --> 15:40.520
It's quite a tongue twister to be honest.

15:40.520 --> 15:49.800
I know, I know. It's super interesting. I've been thinking that I started to think that the

15:49.800 --> 15:53.960
better the people pronounce the topic, the more involved they are in the topic.

15:54.040 --> 15:59.240
So if you have no idea about this file, then you are going to try, like, you know,

15:59.240 --> 16:04.760
have a lot of trouble pronouncing it, but then get me wrong. I, I still struggle.

16:09.640 --> 16:16.600
So if you want to send us an recording of yourself saying Interoperable Europe Act, feel free.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.280
Yes.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.360
What is this Act all about?

16:26.200 --> 16:32.200
Yeah, okay. So basically, this is a proposal that the Commission released last year.

16:32.200 --> 16:37.320
And basically, what they want to do is to create a kind of cross-border regulation

16:38.120 --> 16:46.040
that will help the EU, but also member states for public administrations to deliver

16:46.040 --> 16:53.800
interoperable digital services. So basically, they just, they kind of want to help

16:53.800 --> 16:59.880
public administrations to deliver digital public services in a cross-border way.

17:00.840 --> 17:09.400
So here, I have to stop a little bit and maybe go back one step and maybe define what

17:09.400 --> 17:16.200
interoperability is, because I think, yeah, I think it is important. Yeah, when we're talking about

17:16.200 --> 17:22.360
interoperability and interoperable and so on to define what is actually this very funny to

17:22.360 --> 17:29.880
pronounce word. So basically, it is just the ability for information systems, devices and

17:29.880 --> 17:35.720
applications to speak with one another, basically. So just to give a very simple example,

17:35.720 --> 17:43.160
imagine that you live in Germany and then you have your car registered in Germany and then

17:43.160 --> 17:48.520
you're doing a road trip to France and then you are on your road trip and then you arrive to France.

17:49.320 --> 17:55.240
And once you arrive in France, then you want to park your car and then you go to this parking

17:55.240 --> 18:02.600
place, but it turns out that the system that they have doesn't recognize a German plate,

18:02.760 --> 18:09.640
a car plate. So you cannot actually put the plate of your car because this French system doesn't

18:09.640 --> 18:16.920
really recognize any German car registers and then you're unable to park your car into specific

18:16.920 --> 18:23.800
place. So it's this kind of things we're talking about. So I always like to give this very simple

18:23.800 --> 18:28.440
example. So people realize that it's just this kind of stuff that you don't really have to

18:29.240 --> 18:37.880
get trouble to do these very basic things across the U because things you do in your daily life and

18:37.880 --> 18:44.120
that. Exactly. Exactly. And happening like as soon as you leave one country and go to the next one.

18:44.680 --> 18:52.360
Exactly. And then this will kind of enhance the way these systems will speak with one another

18:52.360 --> 19:01.080
across borders, basically. So yeah, that's. And where does Frieza come in here?

19:02.200 --> 19:13.480
Yes, there it is. So yeah, it is, I mean, in my opinion, it is this act to really go on the

19:13.480 --> 19:20.920
direction of Frieza for first because I mean, we're talking about systems and this needs infrastructure

19:20.920 --> 19:26.600
and this needs an infrastructure that is able for the systems to speak with one another.

19:28.040 --> 19:36.440
So I really feel that Frieza for can be super helpful in this regard. And I mean, I also have to

19:36.440 --> 19:42.600
say that Frieza for is already somehow recognized in the act, but yeah, but we have already found

19:42.600 --> 19:49.800
some blue holes as well. And yeah, that's why we are kind of active in this regulation at the moment.

19:50.920 --> 19:58.040
Could you tell me a bit about the loopholes, like where they lie and yeah, how free surface

19:58.040 --> 20:05.560
basically like considered in the act? Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, again, this is like a

20:05.560 --> 20:11.400
whole regulation. So it's quite like lengthy. And I mean, it's not as lengthy like the Cyber

20:11.400 --> 20:17.320
Resilience Act, but it's still like a regulation. So maybe I can focus a little bit more on the

20:18.280 --> 20:24.840
loopholes that we identified that affect the free software community by first explaining

20:24.840 --> 20:32.360
how they want to achieve this interoperability among the EU member states. So basically, they want

20:32.360 --> 20:40.280
to kind of introduce a sort of cooperative framework that will make mandatory the sharing

20:40.360 --> 20:49.160
and reuse between public administrations of the digital services they are offering. So they set

20:49.160 --> 20:54.520
up some kind of measures to achieve this. So for instance, one of the things that they want to

20:54.520 --> 21:06.360
introduce is governance structure. So basically, they want to introduce to a new institution, so to

21:07.080 --> 21:13.000
say, so there is the interoperable Europe board and the interoperable Europe community.

21:13.000 --> 21:21.000
So the idea is that these two interact with one another in a bottom up and up down a way. So

21:21.000 --> 21:28.200
the community will have the expertise and will give the import and so on. And the board basically

21:28.200 --> 21:35.560
will be the one taking or having the decision making power. So the board will be the one set in

21:35.560 --> 21:41.400
up agenda and decide what are the goals for the next year and how they will achieve this and so on.

21:43.160 --> 21:49.240
And here comes one of the loopholes that we have found and is that the way the board is

21:49.240 --> 21:57.400
constitute. It doesn't really include civil society. So just to be very quick, the board at the moment

21:57.400 --> 22:05.320
will be constituted by the one representative of each member state, the commission, the committee

22:05.320 --> 22:12.200
of the regions and the European Economic and Social Committee. So not really social civil society here

22:12.200 --> 22:16.680
and more specifically, the free software community is not in both at all here.

22:17.720 --> 22:23.880
Yeah, we know that they will be also an interoperable Europe community. But we believe these

22:24.680 --> 22:32.920
boards that will actually make the decisions needs to be more inclusive and has a more participation

22:32.920 --> 22:39.480
of different stakeholders. Especially if this is the one that holds all power to decide.

22:40.120 --> 22:47.560
Exactly, exactly. And that's exactly what we are trying to do here. And it is super interesting

22:47.560 --> 22:52.760
because even as I mentioned, the European Parliament is not even there. So at the moment, this is

22:53.640 --> 22:58.120
been discussed in the European Parliament and we have already seen some amendments coming from

22:58.120 --> 23:04.920
them saying that they also want to be part of this board. So I think in this case, the European

23:04.920 --> 23:10.520
Parliament has also noticed that more actors should be involved in this board and that's why we are

23:11.240 --> 23:16.040
really trying to push for the free software community to have a seat on this board.

23:16.280 --> 23:24.040
Yeah, and then yeah, so this will be the structure. And then basically what they want to do is to make

23:25.320 --> 23:31.880
mandatory for public administrations to chair these solutions. But the way it is written at the

23:31.880 --> 23:38.600
moment, it's like when requested. So I mean, if you're going to have interoperable solutions

23:39.560 --> 23:44.120
and they are free software, then this doesn't have to be requested. Then you can just avoid this part

23:44.120 --> 23:51.800
of request and be requested and just chair and reuse solutions that are there, which I mean

23:51.800 --> 23:57.800
come again with this whole thing of why do you need to develop something from scratch if you can

23:57.800 --> 24:03.720
reuse something that it's already out there. And yeah, they also want to introduce a portal where

24:03.720 --> 24:08.680
the public administrations will chair these solutions and there will be some assessments to see

24:08.760 --> 24:14.520
how interoperable the solutions are. And yeah, this is kind of like a very quick overview of

24:15.160 --> 24:19.880
what the interoperable Europe Act wants to implement.

24:21.560 --> 24:28.120
Yeah, so part of the loophole that we saw is already mentioned that it's on the board, but then

24:28.120 --> 24:38.280
there is also some lack of indicators and ways to measure and monitor progress, which this has

24:38.280 --> 24:46.440
already been kind of heard from the parliament. So we have seen that they already noticed that

24:46.440 --> 24:52.600
these indicators are also lacking because this is something that unfortunately happens quite often

24:52.600 --> 24:57.560
that they want to implement something, but there is no way to monitor how this implementation

24:57.560 --> 25:04.280
is going and then there is no way to see how effective these legislations are if there is no way

25:05.080 --> 25:13.000
to measure such progress. There is also not budget, so they want to basically put even more burden

25:13.000 --> 25:22.280
on public administrations without any budget, so we was trying to make them aware of the need of

25:22.280 --> 25:29.880
this. All right, so they expect like public administrations across Europe, across the EU

25:30.840 --> 25:39.640
to participate and to work on interoperability, which is quite good. So interoperability is a good

25:39.640 --> 25:47.160
thing, I would say, at least if it's free software or based on free software. But they have no

25:47.160 --> 25:56.120
budget allocated for this and they are also like they're expecting quite a lot and it does not

25:56.120 --> 26:03.160
look like they are thinking this through or at least trying to measure how effective it is and

26:03.160 --> 26:10.600
how good it is working. Is that what I got right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So I mean we know

26:10.600 --> 26:15.560
also that this is not a document, like a budget document, so it shouldn't be specified how much

26:15.560 --> 26:23.000
and so on, but it should be at least defined or a name where the money or the budget will come

26:23.000 --> 26:32.200
for such tasks or for such implementation as well. Yeah, and in general, like we feel that auto

26:32.200 --> 26:40.520
free software is it's already included somehow as a key to enhance and so on. I feel like this is

26:40.520 --> 26:46.120
exactly the place where free software, like the definition of free software should brought up

26:46.120 --> 26:52.280
as well, so we already skipped the part of defining what free software is because there is already

26:52.280 --> 27:01.240
a definition and they can easily just include it here in this document and yeah, and that what

27:01.240 --> 27:06.440
comes with it so that if it's free software and then they go in the direction of free software

27:06.440 --> 27:14.600
first, then public administrations must share their software in a co-chair platform, you know,

27:14.600 --> 27:20.200
like the European Commission already has a public repository, so let's make use of such repository

27:20.280 --> 27:27.720
for for this goal, you know, for making easier chairing and reuse of digital solutions from

27:27.720 --> 27:33.320
public administrations. It's quite connected to public money, public code as well, isn't it? Yes,

27:33.320 --> 27:38.920
exactly, that's that's what I meant in the beginning, like it's it's always brings us to

27:40.040 --> 27:45.560
the core arguments, which is I mean if it's public, if it's public money, if you're going to

27:45.560 --> 27:50.680
develop something as software that it's using public money, then let's make it also available

27:50.680 --> 27:57.240
to the public with free software, so I mean in the specific file, we're really bringing up

27:57.240 --> 28:08.200
the arguments of public money, public code quite a lot, yeah, I see. Okay, and so SDF is you already

28:08.200 --> 28:15.480
mentioned that you do a lot of work for this and all around the interuropa, the Europe Act.

28:17.240 --> 28:22.920
SDF is of e taking a stand in the debate and can you define this a bit more for me? Like

28:22.920 --> 28:27.800
your demanding free software should be included, but is there like a specific

28:30.280 --> 28:36.760
part that you would now like to highlight a bit? Yeah, if I could wrap up everything in one

28:36.760 --> 28:43.160
demand is that we want a seat in the board, we want the free software community to be represented

28:43.160 --> 28:49.160
in the board because we believe that the community has the knowledge and the expertise to actually

28:49.160 --> 28:57.240
contribute a lot, not only within the community, but also by being able to make decisions.

28:57.480 --> 29:07.080
And yeah, so I mean for this, so the way we're being active is we're engaging, actually engaging

29:07.080 --> 29:13.560
with different stakeholders, with decision makers, so we actually meet them, we propose

29:13.560 --> 29:22.280
wardings or we try to prepare some texts of how this could look like, but then we, what we're

29:22.280 --> 29:29.880
also trying to do is to raise awareness of this by giving talks and by actually sharing with

29:29.880 --> 29:36.120
the community the importance of this act and why we're trying to achieve with it.

29:38.040 --> 29:42.680
Yeah, that weird comes about the seat, but then yeah, as I already briefly mentioned,

29:42.680 --> 29:49.240
then we're also trying to push for more indicators for ways to monitor the progress of such

29:50.200 --> 29:58.360
regulation. We are trying to push a little bit more for support for the free software community

29:58.360 --> 30:04.680
within this this file as well. And in general, that this whole idea of the whole interoperable

30:04.680 --> 30:11.080
Europe Act goes on the direction of free software. So I think it would save a lot of time,

30:11.080 --> 30:17.320
a lot of money, and it would actually help a lot public administrations if we make it,

30:17.320 --> 30:21.880
you know, like you, you should actually explain why you're not using free software.

30:21.880 --> 30:27.080
If you want to have interoperable systems, then and you're not using free software, then just

30:27.080 --> 30:33.320
maybe explain us a little bit why you're not using free software. So this is a, I guess,

30:33.320 --> 30:42.440
in a very broad way, what we're trying to achieve here. Yeah, how can other support you in this,

30:43.080 --> 30:50.040
like how can other support software freedom in the interoperable Europe Act?

30:51.400 --> 30:58.360
Yeah, I mean, at the moment, then what we are doing is, I mean, at the FSE, so we're trying to

30:59.000 --> 31:06.440
advocate how the regulation would look like. But after that, then there will come the implementation

31:06.440 --> 31:13.640
for member states, which means that every EU country will have to implement this and take measures

31:13.640 --> 31:21.640
to make this happen. And then here, I always like to say that I mean, one can always reach out to

31:21.640 --> 31:27.320
public to the public administration. This is also something that comes with the public money

31:27.320 --> 31:34.040
public code initiative, which is you know, you know, like public administrations are not necessarily

31:34.120 --> 31:40.200
or not only the parliament and the president and the mayor, but it's also your university, your

31:40.200 --> 31:47.320
school, the hospitals, your library, and you can always reach out to them. You can always bring up

31:47.320 --> 31:55.400
the benefits and the arguments for free software in public administrations. And this could sound

31:55.400 --> 32:02.760
like, I mean, it is, it is in a way, at the mountain task, because engaging with public administrations

32:02.840 --> 32:10.120
can take some time. But it's really a small thing that can help us a lot. I mean, the more administrations

32:10.120 --> 32:17.160
know about the benefits of free software and how can actually help their workflows and their

32:17.160 --> 32:26.280
infrastructure. The easier is also for us in a kind of bigger scale to pass our message,

32:26.280 --> 32:31.880
because it's, you know, the more people understand what we're talking about the easier, you know,

32:31.880 --> 32:38.040
they will hear us and they will get what, yeah, that we want to say. What would you say to somebody

32:38.040 --> 32:44.440
who is now thinking, yeah, but there needs to be a law and let's have a top down and not

32:45.480 --> 32:52.040
who does not want to engage with the public administration or who like even if someone from

32:52.040 --> 32:59.560
the public administration things are, you know, I don't see how I can change something. It's just me,

32:59.560 --> 33:03.720
I'm on my own. I don't know. What would you say to those people?

33:06.120 --> 33:13.640
Yeah, I mean, first of all, I completely understand that the thought, I think this is something that

33:13.640 --> 33:19.000
a lot of people get like, I'm not going to be able to change the world. Why do I even care to change

33:19.000 --> 33:26.600
something? But I mean, if we all keep thinking that, then probably we won't achieve anything. But

33:26.600 --> 33:34.280
if we like to believe that one person in every small town or over the world is doing something and

33:34.280 --> 33:40.840
then that to someone else is joining this person and oh, yet another person, this is how a whole

33:40.840 --> 33:47.400
movement and a whole change starts. So I would say that I think it's important to think that

33:47.400 --> 33:54.200
even small things, small steps that you do, if you believe that it's good for society and good

33:54.840 --> 34:02.600
for like a general for the general society, I would say it is worth it and you will have an impact

34:02.600 --> 34:07.720
even if you don't see it, it will change quite a lot. So I really like to encourage people to

34:08.360 --> 34:16.120
believe that they can help a lot by doing small things such as talking with the public servant or

34:16.120 --> 34:20.680
with somebody in a public administration about this, having the discussion, you don't need to

34:20.680 --> 34:26.920
convince them to migrate their whole infrastructure to change completely everything for free software.

34:26.920 --> 34:32.840
But if you kind of plan the seat or they understand what you mean and the importance, probably

34:32.840 --> 34:39.640
that person will go home and think about it and probably that person will even spread the message

34:39.640 --> 34:47.400
even farther and so on. So I think people we all have the agency to make a lot of change and we

34:47.400 --> 34:54.360
have to believe in that. I like that. I like this how do you phrase it quite a lot. I would

34:55.000 --> 35:00.360
agree with this 100%. That's how a movement starts and as you already mentioned at the beginning,

35:00.360 --> 35:07.000
this can also help you with the work on an European level. So like it makes people aware it pushes

35:07.000 --> 35:12.840
up. Yeah, absolutely. I mean sometimes when I meet the decision makers, I'm very happy if I

35:12.840 --> 35:19.720
leave their office, but they got the idea and the whole concept of what free software is and all

35:21.240 --> 35:29.880
benefits and all what implies to use and to promote free software. So if they understood that and

35:29.880 --> 35:37.080
my message got across that, I would leave the office quite happy. Like I spread the word, I

35:37.160 --> 35:45.400
make this person probably, he or she didn't have any idea about this and I'm happy to share this.

35:45.960 --> 35:53.880
I'm completely sure that person will in some point go back to what they got from me and

35:53.880 --> 36:05.160
so you plan to decide it. Exactly. Exactly. So yeah, I mean that's why I really keep encouraging people

36:05.160 --> 36:13.320
to do this and yeah, I mean it's for sure like working on a higher level, you know, the U-level

36:13.320 --> 36:19.800
influence in the world in a new legislation will look like it's important and it's a big step,

36:19.800 --> 36:27.080
but talking to someone else in your library, it's also as important as this. So I think it's,

36:27.720 --> 36:34.280
it is yeah, it's a whole process and one thing complement each other. So it's very few time.

36:35.240 --> 36:43.480
Yeah, exactly. Okay. Last question, but not some one that I would like to miss. You know,

36:43.480 --> 36:50.360
we have that software day. And on this day, we celebrate all the people contributing to free

36:50.360 --> 36:57.000
software and we say thank you to them, we reach out to them and say it's so awesome that you're

36:57.000 --> 37:01.720
participating in the free software universe that you're doing something for software freedom,

37:02.600 --> 37:09.960
that you're designing, contributing in another way, writing code or yeah, advocating for software

37:09.960 --> 37:15.880
freedom. Is there someone or a project that you would like to say thank you to today because I

37:15.880 --> 37:21.560
also believe we should not only do this once a year, but every time we have the chance to do that.

37:21.560 --> 37:29.960
Yes, absolutely. Well, I really think I have to say thank you to a very lovely project that

37:29.960 --> 37:40.360
I started in Berlin and this called DRIP. And it's basically a menstrual cycle app. So you can

37:40.360 --> 37:50.440
check or you can monitor your cycle and so on. And also it has some fertility features as well.

37:51.640 --> 37:58.120
And I just have to say, I mean, this might be very personal, but over the last years, I was

37:58.120 --> 38:04.280
struggling a lot to find such app that could actually protect my data, right? Because I wanted to

38:05.080 --> 38:12.520
be aware of my body and follow it, but I didn't want to give away such data to who knows.

38:14.520 --> 38:20.920
So once I found this project and all the things, all like the lovely community behind it,

38:20.920 --> 38:25.880
and how amazing the app also is, I am just like completely fell in love with it.

38:26.840 --> 38:32.840
So yeah, I just want to thank this people behind DRIP because they can actually

38:33.800 --> 38:41.560
help me to control not only my body and my menstrual cycles and so on, but also my personal data,

38:41.560 --> 38:48.440
which is something that, yeah, sometimes we are not that aware of. So yeah, I want to thank them.

38:49.080 --> 38:54.920
Thank you. That's a nice thing to say. Like it's a very handy app. And it's nice to say thank you

38:54.920 --> 39:01.640
for something like that. Yeah. So if I would also promote it here, if you want to try it,

39:01.640 --> 39:04.920
I will include it in the show notes. Yes, you should.

39:07.080 --> 39:11.960
Hello about the European policy and DRIP, and DRIP.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.440
I like the very versatile.

39:16.600 --> 39:26.040
Okay. Oh my God. Thank you, Lina. Thank you so much for talking to me about European politics.

39:26.040 --> 39:32.760
And I know it's quite complicated, but you did just a well-top and narrowing it down. And also,

39:33.720 --> 39:38.680
yeah, I now feel very motivated. I do want to go to the library and talk to my library.

39:39.000 --> 39:45.240
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much for the invitation. And, yeah, I mean, I really hope this

39:46.280 --> 39:51.400
make the Interparable Europe Act a little bit more clear. And also,

39:52.200 --> 39:57.560
that people can know a little bit better where we're doing, where we aim in to do, and they can

39:57.560 --> 40:04.840
also support us. And I will be super happy if someone here listening to us have some ideas,

40:05.400 --> 40:12.920
they want to participate, they can always contact us at the office fee. We rely a lot on our community,

40:12.920 --> 40:18.200
and we will be more than happy to have our community getting active around this topic,

40:18.840 --> 40:25.320
that is as important as the others. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you very much. Those were very nice

40:25.320 --> 40:31.000
closing words. I believe it like that. Thank you, Man. Thank you very much, Bunny. Bye, bye, Lina.

40:31.480 --> 40:37.640
