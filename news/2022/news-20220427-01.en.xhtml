<h1 id="eu-ecodesign-36-organisations-demand-the-right-to-access-and-to-reuse-hardware">EU Ecodesign: 38 organisations demand the right to access and to reuse hardware</h1>
  
  <p>
  The FSFE publishes an open letter, co-signed by 37 organisations and companies, to ask EU legislators for the right to install any software on any device, including full access to hardware. These rights support reusability and longevity of our devices. The alliance is composed of entities from environmental, economic, and technological sectors.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The European Union is about to redefine the ecodesign criteria for 
    products in several legislative proposals, including the 
    Sustainable Product Initiative, the Circular Electronics 
    Initiative, and the Right to Repair. These proposals aim at 
    extending the usage time of hardware and facilitating circular use 
    of electronic devices. The current regulations stem from 2009 and 
    do not include any criteria regarding the design and licensing of 
    software as an important factor for the sustainability of 
    electronic products. Software directly influences how long 
    consumers can keep using their devices.

  <p>
    Nowadays, users who want to keep using their devices for a longer 
    time, or to reuse their hardware in a creative way, face a wide 
    range of software barriers: from obsolescence to an unexpected 
    end-of-support, from spare part serialization to locked boot 
    loaders. In practice, these artificial restrictions on using and 
    reusing hardware are ultimately imposed by software. Neither 
    consumers nor professional third-party services can overcome them, 
    often simply due to the obscurity of proprietary software licensing 
    models. Free Software licensing solves many of these issues and in 
    this way becomes crucial for an eco-friendly design and the 
    sustainability of hardware; this is the core message of an <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/openletter.html">Open Letter 
    published today by the Free Software Foundation Europe and co-signed by 37 European organisations and companies</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among the initial signees are large repair unions: The European 
    Right to Repair Campaign, the Round Table Repair, and the Netzwerk 
    Reparatur Initiative - together representing hundreds of 
    initiatives and associations of the European repair sector. 
    Together with iFixit, Fairphone, Germanwatch, Open Source Business 
    Alliance, Wikimedie DE, Digitalcourage, European Digital Rights 
    Initiative, and 26 more organisations, they ask European 
    legislators for a more sustainable digital economy by giving users 
    the right to freely choose operating systems, software, and 
    services. The letter divides this right into four core demands:
  </p>
  
  <div class="color-box background rounded" data-color="android-blue">
    <h3 id="universal-right-to-install-any-software-on-any-device">Universal right to install any software on any device</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="with-image-left small-img">
    <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/big/4bc66bc88db53000d4c61158a2c59ed8.png" alt="three gears in different colors and sizes integrate with each other, while one has the coding abbreviation  on it" />
    <div>
      <p>
        Users must have the universal right to install and develop any 
        operating system and software they want on any device. Legal, 
        technical, or other obstacles to reusing these devices for any 
        purpose must not be allowed.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="color-box background rounded" data-color="android-blue">
    <h3 id="free-choice-of-online-service-providers">Free choice of online service providers</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="with-image-left small-img">

    <div>
      <p>
        Using certain hardware must not dictate which online services 
        to use. The obligation to connect online services via Open 
        Standards must empower users to choose services from diverse 
        manufacturers, including self-hosted services or those hosted 
        by any third party.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class="color-box background rounded" data-color="android-blue">
    <h3 id="interoperable-and-compatible-devices">Interoperable and compatible devices</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="with-image-left small-img">

    <div>
      <p>
        Using certain hardware must not dictate which other hardware to 
        buy in order to keep those devices connected. Manufacturers 
        must provide any data necessary to run a device in Open 
        Standards format, allowing interoperability of devices. 
        Artificial incompatibility of devices must not be allowed.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class="color-box background rounded" data-color="android-blue">
 <h3 id="publication-of-source-code-of-drivers-tools-and-interfaces">Publication of source code of drivers, tools, and interfaces</h3>
</div>

    <div>

  <p>
    Manufacturers must enable users to repurpose, replace, or repair 
    any part of a device. This is only possible if users can access and 
    reuse the source code of all necessary drivers, tools, and 
    interfaces to run the device and its components. This means that 
    the source code of tools, drivers, and interfaces of every piece of 
    hardware within a device must be published under a Free Software 
    licence.
  </p>
      </div>
  </div>

<br></br>

  <p>
    The FSFE and 37 European organisations and companies stress the above demands as necessary for 
    sustainable use and reuse of our hardware. Empowering users with 
    the right to freely choose operating systems, software, and 
    services will allow them to use and reuse their devices for a 
    longer period.
  </p>

  <p>
    The initial signatories of the open letter include civil society 
    organisations from the environmental, economic, and technological 
    sectors. Several companies support these demands as well, showing 
    that a more sustainable digital society and economic growth are not 
    contradictions. The list of these initial signees in alphabetical 
    order is:
