<h3>Copyright originality in the EU</h3>
<p>The  debate about copyright originality threshold is growing within European jurisdictions due to an expected decision of the Court of Justice of the EU (SAS v. World Programming). In January, the `Red Bus' case in the UK, and a decision on newspapers' status in Slovakia have shed light upon what exactly is copyrightable.</p>

<p>Indeed, a case in the UK over infringement of copyright in a photograph showing an iconic London red bus with Big Ben and Westminster as a black and white background, is raising arguments over originality and copyright doctrine about intent that could have important effects on software developers, as Andrew Katz explained.</p>

<p>Another case in Slovakia answered the issue of originality in newspapers articles negatively.</p>

<h3>Library License</h3>
<p>The Library License projects to give a way for publishers to grant non-commercial lending rights to libraries through a licensing framework. “Explicitly modeled on Creative Commons licenses with a similar eye towards simplicity and granularity,” Library Licenses could be constructed in several different ways. The most simple example is a straightforward grant, where libraries could acquire and then lend ebooks after they had been on the market for a period of time ranging from instantaneous to some number of years. <i>See</i> <a href="http://dp.la/2012/01/12/press-library-license-a-suggested-framework/"> article by Kenny Whitebloom</a> and <a href="http://librarylicense.org/">the project's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Commission proposes a comprehensive reform of the data protection rules</h3>
<p>The  European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the  EU's  1995 data protection rules to strengthen online privacy rights and   boost Europe's digital economy. A  single law will do away with the  current fragmentation and costly  administrative burdens, leading to  savings for businesses of around €2.3  billion a year. The initiative  will help reinforce consumer confidence  in online services, providing a  much needed boost to growth, jobs and  innovation in Europe. <i>See</i> <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/newsroom/data-protection/news/120125_en.htm"> website of European Commission</a>.</p>

<h3>Enter do-not-track (DNT) standard. </h3>
<p>Neelie  Kroes hopes that a standard known as “do not track” (DNT) will have a  big role to play for the future of online privacy. Do Not Track is a  technology and policy proposal that enables users to  opt out of  tracking by websites they do not visit, including analytics  services,  advertising networks, and social platforms. <i>See</i> <a href="http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/neelie-kroes/donottrack/">Neelie Kroes' blog</a> and <a href="http://donottrack.us/">the website of the project</a>;</p>

<h3>Google changes its privacy policy</h3>
<p>With the new policy in place, Google is taking a more proactive approach  towards getting “more relevant results.”   With that blanket policy, users will be treated as a single user across all Google services. <i>See</i> <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/01/24/google-is-changing-its-privacy-policies-with-one-document-to-rule-them-all/"> article at The Next Web</a>.</p>

<h3>iPad litigation</h3>
<p>Court of Appeal of the Hague rejected Apple's appeal, finding no infringement of their Community Design covering the iPad.
