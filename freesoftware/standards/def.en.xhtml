    <h1>Open Standards</h1>

<div id="introduction">

    <p>Open Standards allow people to share all kinds of data freely
    and with perfect fidelity.  They prevent lock-in and other
    artificial barriers to interoperability, and promote choice
    between vendors and technology solutions.  FSFE pushes for the
    adoption of Open Standards to promote free competition in the IT
    market, as they ensure that people find it easy to migrate to Free
    Software or between Free Software solutions.</p>

</div>

    <p>Starting from the definition contained in the original version
    of the European Commission's <a
    href="http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/3473/5585.html#finalEIF">European
    Interoperability Framework (EIF)</a>, we engaged in a dialogue
    with various key players in industry, politics and community. In
    this process, the definition was reworked into a set of five
    points that found consensus among all the involved. The definition
    has subsequently been adopted by the <a
    href="http://selfproject.eu/OSD">SELF EU Project</a>, the 2008
    Geneva <a
    href="http://www.openforumeurope.org/library/geneva/declaration/manifesto-with-logos-final.pdf">Declaration
    on Standards and the Future of the Internet</a> or the <a
    href="http://documentfreedom.org/openstandards.en.html">Document
    Freedom Day</a>. A very similar set of <a
    href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles">"Open
    Standards Principles"</a> was adopted by the UK Government in July
    2014.</p>

    <h2>Definition</h2>

    <p>An Open Standard refers to a format or protocol that is</p>
    <ol>
      <li>subject to full public assessment and use without
      constraints in a manner equally available to all parties;</li>
      <li>without any components or extensions that have dependencies
      on formats or protocols that do not meet the definition of an
      Open Standard themselves;</li>
      <li>free from legal or technical clauses that limit its
      utilisation by any party or in any business model;</li>
      <li>managed and further developed independently of any single
      vendor in a process open to the equal participation of
      competitors and third parties;</li>
      <li>available in multiple complete implementations by competing
      vendors, or as a complete implementation equally available to
      all parties.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Comment on Emerging Standards</h3>

    <p>When a new format or protocol is under development, clause 5
    cannot possibly be met. FSFE believes this is the correct
    behaviour in cases where technological maturity is required. In
    several scenarios, e.g. governmental deployment, the cost of
    failure can be very high.</p>

    <p>In scenarios that seek to promote the growth of Open Standards,
    strict application of the clause could prevent new Open
    Standards. From the view of the definition, such standards would
    compete directly against vendor-driven proprietary formats. In
    such cases, it can make sense to allow failure of clause 5 for
    "Emerging Standards."</p>

    <p>Which treatment such "Emerging Standards" receive is largely
    dependent on the situation. Where cost of failure is high, only
    fully Open Standards should be used. Where promotion of Open
    Standards is wanted, Emerging Standards should receive special promotion.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking: Open Standards are better than Emerging
    Standards and Emerging Standards are better than vendor-specific
    formats. The closer a format comes to meeting all points of the
    definition, the higher it should be ranked in scenarios where
    interoperability and reliable long-term data storage is
    essential.</p>
