   <title>MutterWare #2</title>
   <body>
    <p>
      On the 19th of November there will be a second session
      of the MutterWare, which Hugo started back in March.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MutterWare is a meeting of users of the mail client mutt, either
      long-time experts, just beginners, or even not-yet-users. It's about
      discussing the functionalities, exchanging tips and hacks, and enjoying a
      good talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting will take place in Mozilla's Parisian new offices near the
      Grands Boulevards, starting at 8p.m.
