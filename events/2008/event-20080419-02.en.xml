    <title>Fellowship meeting in Graz</title>
    <body>
      The twenty-first Austrian Fellowship meeting takes place at the Linuxtag
      in Graz. Fellows and other interested people can meet at the FSFE booth
      during the whole event to discuss, and after the end of the event we
      will surely find some location where we can have some beer together :-)
