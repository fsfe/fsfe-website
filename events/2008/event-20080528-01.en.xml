		As in the last years FSFE will be present with a booth (hall 7.2b, booth 122) at LinuxTag 2008. It takes place at Berlin's Expo Center under the Funkturm. FSFE will inform visitors about various aspects of Free Software, like the Freedom Task Force, software patents, the SELF project, GPLv3, our work in the United Nations, or the Fellowship of FSFE. Also it is planned to sell T-shirts from FSFE and books about Free Software.
