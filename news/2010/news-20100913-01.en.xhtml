    <h1>FSFE invites to track down advertising for non-free software on 
governmental websites</h1>

    <p newsteaser="yes">The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is 
launching a campaign to sensibilize the public to the fact that government 
websites are advertising for proprietary software, each time that they 
redirect you to a downloading interface for a non-free PDFreader while 
you have to read a PDF file.</p>

<p>Launched by the Fellowship of FSFE, <a href="http://pdfreaders.org/">pdfreaders.org</a> 
is a site providing information about Free Software PDF readers for all 
major operating systems. It clearly shows that there are many programs to 
read and write PDF documents. Grounding on the conviction that governments 
should not advertise for one private product, in this case a non-free PDF 
reader presented as the only possibility to read PDF documents when there 
are several alternatives. By doing so, governmental institutions give 
indeed an economical advantage to the advertised product over its competitors. </p>
<p>FSFE invites everybody to search through governmental websites for advertising 
and to <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/pdfreaders.en.html">notify them</a> 
to the FSFE.<!-- We also invite you to <a href="www.fsfe.org/campaigns/pdfreaders/petition.html">sign the petition</a> for advertisment-free governmental websites.--></p>

<p>This collection of governmental URL will take place from September, 
13th to October 17th 2010. It takes the form of a contest in which people 
notifying the most advertisements will recieve a price at the end of October.
<!-- The second phase of the campaign will then consist in writing to the 
pointed institutions to try to explain them FSFE's point and to make them 
correct their assertions on their websites.  --></p>

<p>We hope to see you soon on our hunter list</p>
