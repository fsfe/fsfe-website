  <h1>Device Neutrality</h1>

  <div>

    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
        Although digital devices are ubiquitous today, the number of devices on
        which users cannot run Free Software is exponentially increasing. The
        consequence is an increased loss of control over users' technology.
        Device Neutrality aims to enable end-users to bypass gatekeepers to have
        a non-discriminatory use of Free Software on their devices.

    <h2>General Purpose Computers and Free Software</h2>

    <p>
      Digital devices are a present reality in all aspects of life. We use them
      for work, communication, entertainment and internet access. Such devices
      are powerful machines, allowing us to have access to a huge amount of
      features, and perform an infinite number of tasks. Our smartphones,
      tablets, laptops and other connected devices are <i>general purpose
      computers</i>. It means we can potentially run any software we want to
      make full use of the hardware. Software freedom depends on how we can run
      software in devices. Safeguarding <a
      href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">the four freedoms of Free Software</a>
      over operating systems, drivers, app stores, browsers and any software is
      crucial not only for freedom of choice, but also for a healthy,
      competitive and democratic digital environment.

    <h2>Gatekeeper Control and Monopoly over Devices</h2>

    <p>
      Although the devices we use are general purpose computers, device
      manufacturers, vendors and internet platforms have been restricting
      software freedom due by exercising their monopolistic control over our
      equipment. Operating systems, browsers and app-stores constitute a
      <i>termination monopoly</i> which grants such companies powers in the
      sense that they could be considered <i>gatekeepers</i> of gateways for
      end-users to access and control software running on their devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, manufacturers, vendors and platforms controlling devices may
      perform a <i>gatekeeper function</i> in similar ways that a provider of
      an internet access connection controls a <i>gateway</i> to the internet. For
      instance, today's reality of digital markets demonstrate that end-users
      have very few alternatives concerning operating systems and app-stores for
      mobile devices. Browser market is also highly concentrated. Even worse is
      the access and control over the operating system of connected devices
      such as smartwatches and internet of things (IoT) equipment. In general
      terms, tech companies achieve their gatekeeper power by:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Restricting Software Freedom</strong>: Gatekeepers limit users
        to install different operating systems, browsers, apps stores, drivers,
        etc. on their devices. They also impose on users pre-installed apps and
        control their uninstallation.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Locking devices down</strong>: Such companies hinder
        interoperability, exercise tie control over APIs and apply proprietary
        standards, hampering functionalities and blocking access to drivers and
        hardware.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Increasing switching costs</strong>: Gatekeepers maintain users
        in "walled gardens", tie devices to online accounts, bundle app-stores
        and hamper data portability, making it harder for users to switch
        software, devices and services.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Device Neutrality and Free Software</h2>

    <p>
      The monopolistic power of gatekeepers threats software freedom, individual
      autonomy, consumer welfare and digital sovereignty. Device Neutrality
      represent ways to disintermediate the power of gatekeepers to re-establish
      competition on markets and end-user control over devices. Users should be
      able to bypass gatekeepers to restate the ability to run Free Software in
      their equipment. Device Neutrality's main goal is to resolve the
      termination monopoly over devices, so users can enjoy software freedom and
      have access to alternative services and content with their devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since its genesis, the FSFE has been working to put control over
      technology in the hands of end-users. Along the years, we have gained
      experience with several dedicated activities focused on how users can keep
      their control over devices. For us, re-establishing user control over
      devices and fair competition on digital markets require the fostering and
      protection of the following principles:
    </p>

    <figure class="max-width-100 no-border">

        href="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/big/5c451f840cf325cf4dfddf2fa243ec26.jpg">

          alt="Device Neutrality Principles: software freedom, no vendor lock-in and end-user control over data." />
      </a>
    </figure>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Software Freedom</strong>: blocking end-users' freedom to
        install, run and uninstall software on their devices is a central source
        of gatekeepers control. Although gatekeepers may argue that installing
        third party software could be potentially harmful to users due to
        security, data integrity and privacy concerns, in fact commercial
        interests are the main drive to lock users in. Instead, regaining
        control over devices require safeguarding software freedom. Users should
        have the ability to install and uninstall any software, including
        operating systems and app stores. Besides, gatekeepers should provide to
        third party software the same access privileges as the pre-installed
        ones.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>No lock-in</strong>: Keeping users in very restrictive
        environments is another key source of gatekeeper control. Users can only
        access and use different services if their devices can interact and
        communicate with other devices and services. Big tech exercises direct
        control over their customers by locking them into a very limited number
        of proprietary alternatives that operate within a "compatible" but not
        interoperable ecosystem. This results in less freedom for users and
        increasing of switching costs. Therefore, high degrees of
        interoperability, wide implementation of <a
        href="/freesoftware/standards/index.html">Open Standards</a> and easy
        access to APIs' specifications and functionalities invoked by third
        party apps are fundamental. Equally important, devices should not be
        bundled with app stores and online accounts. Gatekeepers should permit
        third-party app stores and code repositories in their devices.
        Gatekeepers should provide non-discriminatory access to Free Software in
        their stores and not favour or give undue preference to their own
        products.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>End-user control over data</strong>: Breaking monopolies over
        devices necessarily requires empowering users to control their own data
        on equipment. Smartphones, smartwatches and computers are very personal
        equipment which accumulate a large amount of personal and non-personal
        data that users care about. Such data constitutes a switching cost that,
        taken together, can be decisive for users to exercise their freedom to
        changing devices. This is especially problematic for switching between
        operating systems. Besides, the importance of the correlation between
        data and software tends to grow, encompassing further developments with
        artificial intelligence and future technologies, which will create an
        additional layer of complexity for end-users controlling their data.
        That's why end-users should be able to easily transfer personal data
        from apps, operating systems and devices. Most importantly, gatekeepers
        should be bound to <a href="/freesoftware/standards/index.html">Open
        Standards</a> and common interfaces for data transfer.
      </li>
    </ul>



    <h2>Digital Markets Act: enforcing Device Neutrality in the EU</h2>

    <p>
      Device Neutrality got attention from policymakers in Europe and in 2022
      was included in the
      <a href="/activities/devices/devices.html">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>,
      the European Union's largest initiative to regulate gatekeepers in digital
      markets. Although the law contains the principles for making Device
      Neutrality a reality, its regulations concern only very large platforms.
      The DMA establishes obligations for gatekeepers - “dos” and “don’ts” they
      must comply with, and prescripts fines and penalties for infringements.
      The DMA encompasses several rules concerning Device Neutrality, including
      safeguarding the right to uninstall pre-installed software, several
      measures for preventing lock-in, as well as fostering interoperability and
      end-user control over personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>Making Device Neutrality a reality</h2>

    <p>
      Since its genesis, the FSFE has been working to put control over
      technology in the hands of users. Along the years, we have gained
      experience with several dedicated activities focused on how users can keep
      their control over devices. For instance, our
      <a href="/activities/routers/routers.html">Router Freedom</a> and
      <a href="/activities/radiodirective/radiodirective.html">EU Radio
      Lockdown</a> refer to the hardware layer of net neutrality principles.
      Such activities relate with what could be considered the first step for
      Device Neutrality from the perspective of telecommunications law. Besides,
      our activities focused on digital sustainability, as
      <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/">Upcycling Android</a> have a
      strong component for Device Neutrality, as the freedom to install and run
      software in general purposes computers, interoperability and Open
      Standards are important elements for a sustainable digital future.

    <p>
      Nevertheless, although the Device Neutrality principles may sound common
      knowledge for the Free Software community, it is far from being current
      commercial practices by gatekeepers. Monitoring the enforcement and
      compliance of the DMA, the conduction of device-related activities and
      promoting software freedom requires a lot of resources. <a
