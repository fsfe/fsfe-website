    <title>Software patents -- a danger to democracy</title>
    <body>
    Open letter to Mr Borrell Fontelles, President of the European Parliament.
    On July 6th, European Parliament will have to decide on the "Software

  limits, the text that the Council has handed to the Parliament would
  allow patents on software standards, business methods, and website
  development.
