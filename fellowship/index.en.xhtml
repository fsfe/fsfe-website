        <strong>The Fellowship</strong> is the primary way

          Software Foundation Europe</strong>.  It provides
        <strong>collaborative tools</strong> for supporters to
        describe what they are doing and interact with each
        other. The Fellowship is a society for people who want
        to help the Free Software movement
        <strong>grow</strong>.

        groups</a> are emerging in more and more European cities. These groups
      allow Fellows from an area to meet and get to know one another. Groups
      undertake activities ranging from a comfortable beer to running public
      awareness <a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/FellowshipEvents">events</a>.
