	Statement of FSFE and FSF Latin America to the 2005 WIPO General Assemblies
    </title>

   Not continuing what was begun, or changing from a horse to a mule
   midstream, as the honored Indian delegate so eloquently put it, would

   North and South. For this reason we strongly support the notion of
   letting the IIM process finish what it began.
