    <h1>Campaignname</h1>

    <div id="introduction">
      <p>The adoption of Free Software by schools and educational institutions
      is fundamental for our society. Following a campaign that started in the
      Netherland, where a crucial debate is going on at the political level, we
      wish to support the adoption of Open Standards and Free Software by all
      public-funded institutions in Europe, sharing the same objectives of our
      Dutch partners. Schools should teach children to be good members of the
      community, and should not provide product training for companies that do
      not respect freedom.</p>

    <h2>Our arguments:</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>We aim to make the use of open standard mandatory for all the
      public-funded institutions. Only open standards can assure a truly
      democratic and reliable access to information in the long periode. </li>

      <li>We stand for the mandatory use in public institutions of
      platform-independent access to services and information. Proprietary
      services can force students and their families to buy and use proprietary
      software.</li>

      <!-- mk: This part is too long -->
      <li>We struggle to stop the practice of free training for producers of
      proprietary software in public schools through the teaching of limited
      product specific skills. Free software allow student to share their
      software and to study how it works. It eliminates wage distinctions among
      different students: that's democracy! Furthermore, it helps teachers to
      teach values as tolerance and solidarity. The adoption of proprietary
      software in schools teaches students to be dependent from proprietary
      software producers. Free software allows them to understand the value of
      freedom.</li>

      <li>We strive to stop the practice of selling software to teachers,
      students and their families against prices that are exremely below market
      prices.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>In order to make sure this subjects are included in the European
    political agenda, and make sure that important policy change take place, we
    need to encourage public awareness at any level of the society. Your help
    is crucial. </p>
