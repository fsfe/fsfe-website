  <h1>Launch event – Public Money? Public Code! Spanish Brochure</h1>

  <p> 
    Thanks to the support and hard work of our volunteers, our Public Money? 
    Public Code! brochure is now available in Spanish. In this event we will 
    explore the already implemented good practices, but also the challenges that 
    lie ahead to modernise the public digital infrastructure with public code in 
    Spain. The event will be held in Spanish. 
  </p> 

  

  <p>
    In the framework of our <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money? Public Code! </a> initiative we demand that software developed by the public sector with publicly funded money should be available to the public under a Free Software license. To support these demands, we provide an exhaustive brochure which is dedicated to public bodies and serves as an instrument to address decision-makers to inform them about the advantages of Free Software. Thanks to that it has become easier to convince them of modernising public digital infrastructure with public code.

    During the event we want to discuss the current situation in Spain and also present our brochure. We are glad to present the following panellists: Luis Falcón, founder of GNUHealth, Ricardo Muñoz from Lliurex, Alexis Puente Montiel from Pica Pica HackLab, Ana Albalat Martínez and Francesc Busquets in representation of Linkat, and Aleix Pol Gonzalez, president of KDE.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
   Our panellists come from different areas; education, health, and civil society. They will help us to better understand the already implemented and working Free Software solutions driven by the public sector. We will briefly explore the process that Pica Pica Hacklab went through to convince the Parliament of Asturias to support our demands, and we will discuss the future that is ahead for public code in the public sector in Spain.

  <p>
The event will take place online on <strong>Monday, 13 December 2021 from 18:00 to 19:30 CET.</strong> After registration, the BBB instance link will be shared.
