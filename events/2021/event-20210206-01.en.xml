        <title>FSFE with booth, talks and dev room at FOSDEM</title>

    <body>
      <p>The FSFE will be present at FOSDEM, the biggest annual Free Software happening in Europe. While FOSDEM normally takes place in Brussels, this year it will happen online. Max Mehl gives a talk about the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/reuse/">"Best practices for declaring copyright and licenses"</a> and Lucas Lasota will speak about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/netneutrality/">"Net Neutrality and Free Software: The Case of Router Freedom in Europe"</a>. The FSFE will also be present with a <a href="https://stands.fosdem.org/stands/free_software_foundation_europe/">digital booth</a> that you can visit to talk with people.</p>
		<p>Apart from the digital booth, for the first time the FSFE will co-organise the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/legal_and_policy_issues/">Legal and Policy Issues Devroom</a> at FOSDEM. We will also continue with our traditional pre-FOSDEM meeting the day before FOSDEM. This is our community get-together which will be kicked-off with a keynote by Cory Doctorow.</p>
