Today marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the initial announcement of the
GNU Project, a pioneering initiative to develop an operating system that gives
all users the freedom to modify it and publish modified versions, individually
or working together. The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) commends the
substantial achievements of GNU's first quarter-century and looks forward to
furthering their shared goal of facilitating software freedoms.
