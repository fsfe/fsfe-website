      <p>The story “Ada &amp; Zangemann – A Tale of Software, Skateboards and Raspberry Ice Cream” inspires the software freedom community because it covers more than the simple value of learning to program. It also covers the importance of control over technology and its impact on society. In this way the story is inspiring many kids, teens, parents and many others to learn programming and shape technology.</p>
     <p>In this presentation, Nico Rikken and Matthias Kirschner will tell the story how the automation developed over time. We'll share the inspiring stories from the community that leveraged the automation and influenced its development. The technical challenge of the automation is fun, but the community stories give it meaning and motivate me to keep at it.</p>

     <p>FOSDEM 2026 is taking place on 31 January and 1 February at the ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels</p>
