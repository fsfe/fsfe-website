    <h1>German Federal CIO dares new step towards IT-Sovereignty</h1>

    <h2> Clarification : market-standards are no proprietary standards </h2>

<p>Minister of state Cornelia Rogall-Grothe, IT-mandatory of the German government, said in an interview with the newspaper C't [1] that "only thanks to Open Standards [2] can [the government] reach its independence from the producers and thereby prevent risks." Further could "a maximal interoperability be reached with open IT-Standards" .</p>

<p>For Rogall-Grothe a standard must first be fully publicized, second be unrescritively and durably used, and third not be subjected to any legal assignement. „'The government underlines herewith : a standard is only recognized as such if Free-Software companies can also implement it without legal or technical barriers", says Matthias Kirschner, German Coordinator of the FSFE. 
</p>

<p>Futhermore makes Rogall-Grothe it clear: market standards are not about standards which already dominate the market. "The notion of market standards is used in the IT-state contract in opposition to the standards that were developped by the administration, and not in opposition to the open standards", thinks the state secretary. Binding standards must however in future only be open standards. The term of "market standard" is commonly used against Open Standards and Free Software. The government of Saxony itself justified in May its use of proprietary standards, saying that the IT- state contract required öarket standards [3]. Already in April the FSFE criticized this formulation and asked the German Federal CIO to clarify it [4]. Rogall-Grothe shows with this declaration that the notion of "market standard" justifies by no means the use of proprietary standards by the authorities.
</p>

<p>„Open standards in public administration are a keystone towards IT-sovereignty" Offene Standards in der öffentlichen Verwaltung sind der Schlüssel zur
IT-Souveränität", welcomed Karsten Gerloff, President of the Free Software
Foundation Europe. „You ensure, that our state and its citizens are in the end the ones who control our IT-infrastructure".</p>

<p>Also the European Comission sets more and more on Open Standards, as stated in the Digital Agenda that was released in May, even if setbacks are always threatening.The FSFE demands now from Rogall-Grothe, to make Germany's influence grow all over Europe and to make sure that the new version of the European 
Interoperability Framework (EIF) [5] entails a strong definition of Open Standards.
</p>

<p>To be an<a href="/projects/os/def.html">Open Standard</a> Formats and Rptocols must fulfil the "AEIOU"-criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>a</strong>pplicable (without restrictions): free from legal or technical clauses that limit its utilisation by any party or in any business model,</li>
  <li><strong>e</strong>xisting (implementations): available in multiple complete implementations by competing vendors, or as a complete implementation equally available to all parties.</li>
  <li><strong>i</strong>ndependent (of a single vendor): managed and further developed independently of any single vendor in a process open to the equal participation of competitors and third parties</li>
  <li><strong>o</strong>pen (specification): subject to full public assessment and use without constraints in a manner equally available to all parties</li>
  <li><strong>u</strong>ntainted (with dependencies to closed standards): without any components or extensions that have dependencies on formats or protocols that do not meet the definition of an Open Standard themselves</li>
</ul>
