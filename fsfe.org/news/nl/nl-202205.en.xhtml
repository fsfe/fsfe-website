<h1>46 Sign OS Freedom Open Letter +++ Fair Market App +++ Your Digital Rights</h1>


<p>
  In this Issue: an alliance of 46 entities - and counting - supports the 
  universal right to install any software on any device. Free Software 
  is being considered for inclusion in the EU Declaration of Digital 
  Rights. FSFE's transparency in public procurement app gets to EU 
  Datathon finals. Italian FSFE volunteers prepare tour.

<p>
  The EU is redefining their ecodesign criteria for environmentally 
  friendly electronics. The FSFE provided input by publishing an <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/openletter.html">open letter</a> 
  demanding the right to install any software on any electronic device. 
  This right would allow to keep our devices longer, but it requires manufacturers to follow certain rules. For example, 
  manufacturers must be required to unlock bootloaders on all devices, 
  including computers, tablets and phones; they must also  
  publish full specifications for every component on the device. This  
  allows us and any third party to better repair our devices, and even 
  reuse parts of them. The use of Open Standards is also necessary for 
  devices to communicate and operate with each other.

<p>
  Initially <a href="/news/2022/news-20220427-01.html">38 
  organisations</a> agreed on the necessity of these conditions and 
  signed the open letter before publication. It is still 
  possible to sign the letter and more than 45 organisations 
  have now signed. It speaks volumes that tech companies, right to repair 
  initiatives, and important environmental organisations support the 
  right to install any software on any device.

<h2 id="fsfe-s-app-prototype-shortlisted-to-eu-datathon-finals">FSFE's App Prototype Shortlisted to EU Datathon Finals</h2>

<p>
  The FSFE System Hackers created an <a href="https://ted.sehn.dev">application prototype</a> aspiring to 
  connect publicly available tendering and company data and to allow 
  analysis of this data. The goal of the app is to allow citizens and 
  experts to monitor suspicious market activity of public interest. The 
  project idea has been a success and made it to the top six out of 
  26 entries in the ‘transparency in public procurement’ challenge of 
  the EU Datathon 2022. Our team has now been invited to further 
  develop the app.

<h2 id="digital-rights">Update: Digital Rights Declaration</h2>

<p>
  The EU is in the process of discussing the Declaration of Digital 
  Rights and Principles. The <a href="/news/2022/news-20220503-01.html">European Parliament has now 
  agreed on a common text</a> recognising Free Software as a way to 
  ensure transparency in algorithms and artificial intelligence. The 
  agreed text also stresses the need for 'trustworthy standards 
  and, wherever possible, open source standards'. It encourages 
  'sustainable by design digital technologies that are durable, 
  repairable, and interoperable, both on hardware and software level, 
  and banning practices leading to premature obsolescence'. The 
  FSFE keeps monitoring the ongoing inter-institutional dialogue trying 
  to make sure that the Parliament proposal remains.
</p>

<h2 id="ai">Update: AI Resolution Passed</h2>

<p>
  <a href="/news/2022/news-20220503-01.html">The European Parliament 
  passed a resolution</a> on Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a huge 
  majority. According to the resolution, public procurement should 
  require Free Software, where appropriate, with the goal to encourage 
  cross-border collaboration. The Parliament acknowledges that Free 
  Software can enhance investments and boost innovation in AI 
  technologies in the EU. The FSFE now urges the Parliament to transfer 
  its own position into the AI regulation.

  The Italian volunteers are also preparing a summer tour around the 
  country to let people know that code paid for by the public should 
  also be publicly available. The first stop in the tour is Trento, on 
  June 7th. Learn more about the plans in the mailing lists or chats of 
  <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/Milano">Milano</a> and <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/Sicilia">Sicily</a>. Meet the

  <strong>Zurich</strong> | The local group in Zurich is working on 
  persuading public administrations to migrate to federated social 
  networks. The group have been discussing the idea since early April, 
  and the project gained a boost when many people and entities, 
  including the <a href="https://social.network.europa.eu/explore">European Union</a> 
  have been joining Mastodon. <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/Zurich/2022-05-18">The group will 
  meet</a> again on 18 May 2022.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Netherlands</strong> | Building on the Zurich group's idea, 
  the Dutch team <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/Netherlands/2022-04-20">brainstormed 
  technical solutions</a> to automatically post Dutch municipalities’ 
  news to Mastodon. ‘What if we gather the RSS feeds of 345 Dutch 
  municipalities and feed them to a Mastodon account?’ was a question 
  that caught attention. Fani Partsafyllidou, Project Manager at FSFE, 
  joined the last meeting. The <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/Netherlands/2022-05-25">next 
  meeting</a> is on Wednesday 25 May 20:00 CEST.

  September to 2 October.
