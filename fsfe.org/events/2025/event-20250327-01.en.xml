      <p>Come and join us for an inspiring day in the spirit of free and open source software! Free Software Foundation Europe's Danish chapter (FSFE-DK) hereby invites you to the premiere of the Danish 
      version of the animated film ‘Ada &amp; Zangemann’ in the cinema Øst for Paradis in Aarhus on 27 March, 15:00-17:00. The event starts at 13:00 (CEST) with a screening of the film 
      for schools and opens its doors to all interested parties at 15:00 (CEST). ‘Ada &amp; Zangemann - a tale of software, skateboards and raspberry ice cream’ was created as a children's book in 2021 by Matthias 
      Kirschner, the head of the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), and is a story that conveys the need for the right to use, share, explore and improve in an easy-to-understand way for both 
      children and adults. It is an optimistic story of innovation and technological empowerment that is highly relevant right now.
     <p>After the film, there will be a panel discussion with Matthias Kirschner, author of ‘Ada &amp; Zangemann’ and others, where we will discuss the film's message versus topics such as the need for free and open source 
     open source software in schools and in general in the public and private sector. It's all free to attend.</p>
