My eleven months as trainee and part of the FSFE's international team, 
have been full with new things to learn, great people to meet, 
challenges to overcome and opportunities to grasp. There was never a 
boring day. I was involved in high-level legal and policy work as well 
as community building and awareness-raising activities. I was in the 
core preparation team of short and long-term campaigns.

My internship at FSFE was great! The team was amazing and the work taught me a

		With my internship at the Free Software Foundation Europe, I

    <h2>Who we're looking for:</h2>
<p> 
FSFE interns are a pretty diverse bunch. If you are interested in
working on the frontline of technology policy and activism, then
you've come to the right place. You're fired up about a free
information society, and you've already done something to tell others
why freedom matters? Then this internship is for you. Your academic
background and qualifications matter less than your experience, your
will to learn, and your ability to get things done. We expect:
</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
          Solid basic knowledge of, and considerable interest in, Free
          Software (required)
        </li>
        <li>
          Fluent English (written and spoken) is a requirement; 
          a working knowledge of other languages is an asset.
        </li>
        <li>
          Basic acquaintance with working on GNU/Linux systems (desirable)
        </li>
        <li>
         Ability to be creative, responsible, and to multitask. 
        </li>
        <li>
         Ability to integrate into a young, motivated and professional team
        </li>
        <li>
          No programming skills required. Programming is one of the
          few things you probably <i>won't</i> be doing during your
          internship, unless you're applying for a technical
          internship.
        </li>
	<li>We want more women to be involved in Free Software. That's
	why when there are candidates with equal qualification, we will give
preference to applications from suitably qualified female candidates.</li>
    </ul>

      <p class="none">
I am passionate about Free Software and I always wanted to help with 
its promotion. That's why an offer to help the FSFE was a perfect fit 
for me. During my internship, I worked mostly on developing the FSFE's 
infrastructure and helped by adding documentation for specific tasks 
involving different services. Interns at FSFE are really useful, as 
they bring their experience and knowledge to the FSFE and, given the 
structure and openness of the organisation, are able to do meaningful 
work that has a real value.
