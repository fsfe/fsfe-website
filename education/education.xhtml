          <h2>Education</h2>
          </div>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p> The Free Software Foundation Europe actively promotes the
          use of Free Software in schools and universities. Free Software
          is pedagogically and technologically superior to proprietary
          systems. But more importantly, its basic spirit involving freedom and cooperation
          is the same spirit of education in a democratic environment. 
          </p>

		  <p>
		    We have a more <a href="argumentation.html">detailed argumentation</a>
		    which sums up why we think that Free Software
		    is the kind of software which should be used in education.
		  </p>

          <h2>Associations</h2>

          <p> The Free Software Foundation has separate 
		    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/education/">pages on education</a>.
		  </p>
          <p> There are some organizations which already support and advocate
          the use of Free Software in education:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> The <a href="http://www.ofset.org/">Organization for Free Software
              in Education and Teaching</a> (OFSET) promotes the
              development of free software for the educational system and
              teaching. OFSET is an associated organization of the FSF Europe.
            </li>
            <li> The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/osie">Open Source in Education</a>
  			  Project (OSiE) supports and advocates the use of GNU/Linux systems in the UK.
			</li>

            <li> The <a href="http://fsub.schule.de/">Freie Software und Bildung e.V.</a>
              (FSuB e.V., Association for Free Software and Education) promotes the use of GNU/Linux
              systems in German schools.<br/>
			  Please note that the FSuB e.V. also supports and advocates the use
			  of proprietary software on top of GNU/Linux, a position with which we
			  strongly disagree.
            </li>
          </ul>
