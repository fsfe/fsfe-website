	<h1>DMA: tell us how gatekeepers are handling your interoperability requests</h1>
	
	<p>Free Software developers: your voice is needed! The Free Software Foundation Europe has launched the Digital Markets Act Interoperability Survey to gather first-hand experiences from developers requesting software interoperability.</p>
	


<p>Imagine you are a developer building a Free Software
payment system for iOS, or an emulator for the iPad, or even an
alternative app store for the iPhone. You are ready to share your
project with the world, but you are denied access to the APIs you need. Or you try to contact Apple, but you get no reply at all to your
interoperability request. Or the documentation online is faulty, and
there is no reaction to your bug filing on Apple’s tracking system. Or, worst of all, you have your request denied, and no explanation
whatsoever is given of the reasons.</p>

<p>These scenarios are not far-fetched. These are
realities many Free Software developers face in their daily work when
interacting with “gatekeepers” like Apple and other large tech
companies.</p>

<p>The <a
href="/activities/dma/dma.html">Digital
Markets Act (DMA)</a> is a law in the European Union aimed to remediate these issues. Article 6(7) specifically requires gatekeepers, like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon, to provide developers free-of-charge, effective, and documentedaccess to hardware and software features they need for their projects. The idea is simple: enable real competition, encourage innovation, and make room for Free Software alternatives. </p>

<h3>A victory for interoperability!</h3>
<p>During the regulatory dialogues with the European
Commission, the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) has coordinated
efforts within a <a
href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/device-neutrality/202404-FSFE-apple-report-EC.pdf"> coalition
of Free Software projects</a> that
were directly affected, including developers of alternative browsers,
payment systems, app stores, and emulators. We documented their attempts
to request interoperability, and the roadblocks they encountered, vague
procedures, unreasonable requirements, or simply being ignored. We then
presented these findings to the European Commission, calling for clearer
enforcement.</p>
<p>In December 2024, the European Commission started a
regulatory procedure to improve Apple’s procedures for granting
developers interoperability within iOS and iPadOS. The FSFE engaged with
the Commission providing comprehensive inputs <a
href="/news/2025/news-20250116-01.html">demanding
better policies</a> towards Free
Software developers. In March 2025, the Commission published a decision <a
href="/news/2025/news-20250403-01.html">adopting
several of our suggestions</a>,
substantially improving Apple’s procedures for interoperability
requests. In its turn, Apple reacted aggressively, <a
href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/apple-challenges-european-commissions-unreasonable-demands-in-court-appeal/">starting
new litigation against the
Commission</a> in opposition to these
procedures.</p>

<p>Now, the challenge comes with the enforcement of
these rules. Monitoring is paramount.</p>

<h3>Hackers needed: share your experience with
interoperability</h3>

<p>The recent victory achieved by the decision of the
Commission has underscored the importance of interoperability for
innovation. It is enabling alternatives to proprietary services and
ultimately giving users more choice and control over the technology they
use every day</p>

<p>The FSFE has launched the <a
href="https://survey.fsfe.org/index.php/699938?lang=en"><strong><strong>DMA
</strong><strong>Interoperability
Survey</strong></strong></a>, aimed at collecting
crucial input from Free Software developers who have tried, or plan to
try, to request interoperability from companies like Apple, Google,
Microsoft, and Amazon under Article 6(7) of the DMA. We want to monitor
how gatekeepers are handling the interoperability requests submitted by
Free Software developers. We want to hear the developers’ experiences
and to make sure their voices are heard when gatekeepers fall short of
their obligations.</p>

<p><strong><strong>If you are a Free Software developer and made or plan
to make an interoperability request under Article 6(7) of the DMA, we
need your help!</strong></strong> Whether your request was successful, delayed, denied, or
ignored: your insights are valuable. Please, take a look at the survey
or share it with anyone for whom this might be relevant.
</p>
<p>The FSFE will use the findings to identify systemic
issues, advocate for stronger enforcement, and support a full and fair
implementation of the DMA. This protects and empowers developers, and
our software freedom.</p>
