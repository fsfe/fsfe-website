      On Wednesday 26 September 2007 at 19:30, Dr. Michael Stehmann gives a
      speech with the following topics:
      <ul>
        <li>Why licenses?</li>
        <li>Criteria for Free Software licenses</li>
        <li>Which licenses do exist?</li>
      </ul>
      The event takes place in the Restaurant "Mi Dang", Fürstenwall 120, 40217
