<h1>Addressing your questions about the Cyber Resilience Act</h1>

<p>During FOSDEM 2026, the FSFE held a Q&amp;A session on the Cyber Resilience Act together with a representative of the German market surveillance authority and the European Commission as there are still uncertainties and recurring questions.</p>

<p>One question, that we also explored in a survey, is the role of the 
steward. People are still unsure whether and under what circumstances 
they should or want to become a steward. One part of the question is 
relatively easy to answer: no one has to become a steward. The Cyber 
Resilience Act (CRA) is a product regulation that aims to place 
obligations on manufacturers. As long as you are not a manufacturer and 
your software is not incorporated into a product, the CRA does not 
apply to you. It becomes more complex if you develop Free Software that 
is used in products. In this case, the manufacturer must ensure that 
they can fulfil the obligations under the CRA. If the manufacturer 
decides to use your project, you may consider whether you would like to 
become a steward. If you do not want to become a steward, the 
manufacturer should look for alternatives or, for example, fork your 
project so that they can fulfil the obligations under the CRA. However, 
they cannot force you to become a steward.</p>

<p>This gives you the opportunity to work with the manufacturer and be 
compensated for working on your Free Software.</p> 

<p>Besides the option of becoming a steward, there is also the option 
of attestation (Art. 25 CRA). In order to facilitate the due diligence 
obligation, voluntary security attestation programmes could be 
established. This could also be an interesting option for you to help 
ensure the maintenance of your software is sustained in the long run. 
There is still  uncertainty about attestation, which is to be clarified 
by a delegated act of the European Commission. For this purpose, <a href="https://dialog-cybersicherheit.limesurvey.net/113884">we 
have launched another survey</a>, and you are welcome to participate <strong>by 28 
February 2026, midnight AoE</strong>. to contribute your ideas and 
suggestions.</p>

<p>We will evaluate the results and make them available to 
decision-makers and relevant stakeholders, incorporating them into the 
process. Here, too, we will focus our efforts on ensuring that Free 
Software contributors and small projects are protected and 
supported.</p>
