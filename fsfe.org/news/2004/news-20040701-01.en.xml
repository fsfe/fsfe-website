    <title>FSFE issues call for donations</title>
    <body>
      <p>
      The projects of the FSFE are multifaceted: participation in the
      German government's delegation at the "World Summit on the
      Information Society (WSIS)", consulting with the European Union
      during the establishment of the framework programmes,
      participation in AGNULA, a project to build a fully Free
      Software distribution for professional musicians and multimedia
      authors and also the maintenance and advancement of the GNU
      General Public License (GPL).  This diversity costs a lot of
      money: travels round the world, production of information and
      marketing material, personnel cost.
