      "I loved the fact that the children took action without the help of their
      parents, that the government asked the next generation for help to master
      its information system, and that the toys are being recycled to hack and
      improve them (circular economy). As a civil servant, it also reminds me
      of the responsibility that we have. And the drawings are really great!"
