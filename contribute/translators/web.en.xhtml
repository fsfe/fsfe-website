    <h1>Translating web pages</h1>

    <h2>Understanding how the web pages are built</h2>

    <p>
      The web pages of www.fsfeurope.org are maintaned as a set of XML files.
      The web server generates the HTML pages from these XML files
      automatically every even hour. Consequently, all editing of the pages is
      done in the XML files, and the HTML is never edited directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every page on www.fsfeurope.org is named
      "<i>pagename</i>.<i>language</i>.html" (<i>language</i> being the
      2-letter iso-639 code of the language, like "en" for English or "de" for
      German). The source files are named
      "<i>pagename</i>.<i>language</i>.xhtml".<br />
      Some pages have a dynamic part: apart from the fixed texts taken from the
      .xhtml file, they include information from one or several .xml files.
      Whenever such a page is built, the build system takes the translated .xml
      files where available, and falls back to the English version of those
      .xml files that have not yet been translated. This way, such pages
      can end up with parts of the text being translated and other parts still
      showing in English. Examples of such pages include the
      <a href="/index.html">start page</a>, the
      <a href="/news/news.html">news page</a>, and the
      <a href="/events/events.html">events page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Everybody can contribute translations</h2>

    <p>
      All source files (i.e. all .xhtml and .xml files) are publicly available
      for download, so everybody can spontaneously contribute a translation
      without having to register anywhere. However, whenever you start a
      translation and expect it to take longer, please write a short note to
      the <a href="http://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/translators">Translators
        mailing list</a> to avoid that somebody else starts to work on the same
      text simultaneously.
    </p>

    <h3>Contributing missing translations</h3>

    <p>
      If you have a page open in your web browser that has not yet been
      translated to your language, scroll to the end of the page, click on the
      "[XHTML]" link and save the file you get there. You will get the English
      .xhtml file. Rename the file to carry your language code instead of the
      "en" code, and open it in a text editor. Now, translate all text in the
      file that is outside the "&lt;...&gt;" marks; do not change anything
      inside these marks.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of the file there will by a line saying "&lt;/html&gt;".
      Immediately <i>above</i> this line, add a line saying
      "&lt;translator&gt;<i>your name</i>&lt;/translator&gt;".
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are done, send the translated file to the
      <a href="http://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/translators">Translators
        mailing list</a>. Other members of this list can proofread the
      translation, and somebody on that list will ultimately post it to the
      server.
    </p>

    <h3>Updating outdated translations</h3>

    <p>
      If you have a page open in your web browser of which the translation is
      outdated (indicated by a note at the top of the page), scroll to the end
      of the page, click on the "[XHTML]" link and save the file you get there.
      This file is the (outdated) translated version. Next, use the "English"
      link at the top of the page to jump to the English version of the page
      and click on the "[XHTML]" link there, too. The file you get there is the
      (up to date) English version. Now you can compare both files and update
      the translation. Please notice that everything inside the "&lt;...&gt;"
      marks may not be translated.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are done, send the translated file to the
      <a href="http://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/translators">Translators
        mailing list</a>. Other members of this list can proofread the
      translation, and somebody on that list will ultimately post it to the
      server.
    </p>

    <h3>Finding out what needs work</h3>

    <p>
      There is an
      <a href="http://status.fsfeurope.org/web/translations.html">autogenerated
        list of all languages</a> available. On that page, each language code
      is a link to a separate page that lists all outdated and missing
      translations for that language.
    </p>

    <p>
      The list of outdated translations provides an extra feature helpful for
      updating: you can not only downlad the (outdated) translated file and the
      (up to date) English original; you can also view the changelog of both
      files, a protocol of all modifications done to the respective file.
      Comparing the two changelogs usually makes it easy to find out which
      parts of the original were altered since the translation was last
      updated.
    </p>

    <p>
      This translation status page is also the only way to download the .xml
      files that are built into the dynamic pages, like files containing news
      items or event entries.
    </p>

    <h3>Downloading the complete source file tree with CVS</h3>

    <p>
      If it is possible for you to use CVS, you can also download the complete
      source file tree at once.
    </p>

    <p>
      Create a directory in which you want to store the files, change into that
      directory and issue the command<br />
      <code>$ cvs -z3 -d anoncvs@savannah.gnu.org:/webcvs/fsfe co .</code><br />
      When you are asked for a password, just hit the Return key.
    </p>

    <p>
      To update a source tree you previously downloaded that way, you can use
      the command<br />
      <code>$ cvs -z3 update -Pd</code><br />
    </p>

    <h2>Joining the www.fsfeurope.org webmasters</h2>
