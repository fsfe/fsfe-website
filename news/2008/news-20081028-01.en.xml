    <title>Fellowship Interview with Rolf Camps</title>
    <body>
      <p>
		This month Ciarán O'Riordan interviewed Rolf Camps about translating,
		volunteering, and awareness of Free Software in Belgium. Translations
		are utterly crucial for a European organisation, and it's a lot of work
		that doesn't get much visible credit, so Ciarán wanted to ask Rolf
		about motivations and what's involved. This is the second in our series
		of Fellowship interviews - "the smallest unit of freedom".
