<h1>Liability, Interoperability &amp; Free Software in EU: what we are expecting</h1>

<p>After the summer recess,  EU institutions are resuming their 
activities at the end of August. In the coming months, we expect to see 
the adoption of legislation that could have an impact on Free 
Software: the Cyber Resilience Act, the Product Liability Directive, the AI 
Act, and the Interoperable Europe Act. What does all this legislation 
mean for Free Software and its community?</p>

<h3>Liability and Free Software</h3> 

<p>The EU is currently aiming to 
introduce liability rules for software, including Free Software. 
Although the main debate  revolves around the Cyber Resilience Act 
(CRA), the Product Liability Directive (PLD) is just as important. 
Similar rules  are being introduced in the AI Act.</p>

<p>With regard to the 
CRA and the PLD, the Commission’s proposal to exclude Free Software 
“outside the course of a commercial activity” would fail to address a 
large part of the software that would not be covered but would be 
deployed. At the same time, smaller and non-profit projects would be 
harmed as they would have to bear major costs.</p>

<p>For this reason, the FSFE has <a href="/news/2023/news-20230323-01.html">proposed a solution</a> that will lead to more security while safeguarding the Free Software ecosystem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Liability should be shifted to those deploying Free Software instead of those developing Free Software and</li>
<li>Those who significantly financially benefit from this deployment should make sure the software becomes CE-compliant</li>
</ol> 

<p>Before the EU Parliament went into summer recess, we shared the 
latest news on the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). The adoption of  the 
Parliament’s position leaves a situation where <a href="/news/2023/news-20230719-01.html">Free Software developers 
are left with less far-reaching protections</a>. Regular corporate 
donations or contributions by company employees to a project could turn 
non-profit work into a “commercial activity”, and therefore lead to 
liability. The three EU institutions will now negotiate a final text, 
which is likely to be concluded this year. We call on the EU 
institutions to find a compromise that safeguards the Free Software 
ecosystem while shifting liability to those who significantly benefit 
financially from its deployment. <a href="/news/2023/news-20230323-01.html">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Similar rules are being negotiated in the Product Liability Directive (PLD), where the 
FSFE is also demanding protection for Free Software developers. 
However, the Parliament has yet to adopt its position.</p> 

<p>Regarding the AI Act, the EU Parliament has also adopted its final text 
by a large majority. It includes a <a href="/news/2023/news-20230614-01.html">far-reaching exemption for 
non-profit organisations and small Free Software projects up to the 
size of micro-enterprises</a>. 
Negotiations on the final text between the three institutions (also 
known as trialogue, where representatives of the Parliament, the 
Council, and the Commission meet to agree on a final text) are already 
taking place. Here the FSFE calls on the EU Parliament to defend 
its position to ensure that this regulation protects not only Free Software and 
its contributors but also consumers and customers.</p>


<h3>Interoperability and Free Software</h3>
<p>With the proposed Interoperable Europe Act, the EU aims to create a dedicated legal framework on 
interoperability that will enhance cross-border digital public services 
across the Union. Since the beginning of the year, the FSFE has been 
advocating for a more inclusive governance structure in this 
legislation, where different stakeholders, including the Free Software 
community, can be part of the Interoperable Europe Board. A <a href="/news/2023/news-20230323-02.html">proper 
monitoring and evaluation process together with a dedicated budget</a> are 
also part of our demands.</p> 

<p>With the adoption of its final position, the EU Parliament 
has taken a step forward towards <a href="/news/2023/news-20230719-02.html">a more inclusive Board</a>, while at the 
same time introducing clearer indicators and statistics to monitor the 
progress of this legislation. This is particularly important given that 
the Council's recent compromise text still moves in the opposite 
direction by hindering the inclusion of relevant stakeholders in the 
governance structure, as we have <a href="/news/2023/news-20230623-01.html">previously highlighted</a>. Now the European 
Parliament, the Council, and the Commission will have to agree on a 
final text. The FSFE, therefore, calls on the European Parliament to 
maintain its position and not to allow any step backwards.</p>
