    <h1>Thank you for celebrating #ilovefs the whole day without borders</h1>

    <p>On February 14th, people around the globe were
    celebrating the "I love Free Software" day. To all of you, thank you very
    much for participating in our <a
      href="/activities/ilovefs/2012/index.html">#ilovefs-campaign</a> and
    for showing your support for <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free
      Software</a> on this day. We were really
    excited about your creativity and participiation. All these love
    declarations went out to the developers, users and wizards behind Free
    Software and their communities. While some of you dedicated their love to
    specific programs that you enjoy most. We are pretty sure that their
    developers and users have read your love declarations and that your love
    will motivate them to carry on their good work. Here are just a few
    examples and highlights of your love declarations.</p>

<h3>Quotes</h3>
<!--10 ZACCHIROLI Stefano-->
<div class="testimonial" style="margin-bottom:3em">
<img src="/activities/ilovefs/2012/photos/zack_sm.jpg"/>
<p><em>"I love Free Software because we depend more and more upon software, in
every moment of our lives. It is software that handles our email and
social network activities when we communicate; it is software that
controls our ovens and fridges when to prepare our meals; it is software
that drives cars and airplanes when we travel around the world; it is
software that keeps many of us alive when we need hospital equipment or
bio-medical devices like pacemakers.  A world without Free Software
means being held hostage by proprietary software authors that run our
lives.  I love Free Software because it can set us free."</em><br/>
<strong>Dr. Stefano Zacchiroli</strong>, Debian Project Leader, Scientist and Free Software Developer

<h3>#ilovefs-event in the Unperfekthaus</h3>

<p>This year, for the first time, we have been celebrating #ilovefs not only as
an online campaign. In addition we organised an <a
  href="/activities/ilovefs/2012/index.html">#ilovefs-event in the
  Unperfekthaus in Essen</a>. For this event, we invited some speakers to give
talks on the topic of Free Software and even bands to play a concert in the
evening. Despite the fact that there were not as many visitors coming as we
would have loved to see at our first #ilovefs event, we were successful. The
organisation went fine and we received a lot of positive feedback from our
visitors, the speakers and the band members.</p>

<p>Here you can see some impressions from the event:</p>

        <p>Room 404?? Maybe this is the explanation that there was a shortage of people coming: When they were looking for our event, it was just "not found" : )</p></div>
