  <h1>Freedom in Multimedia</h1>
</div>

<p>Multimedia in general and audio in particular were areas dominated almost
exclusively by proprietary software. Within the "A GNU/Linux Audio
distribution" (AGNULA) project, a group of European universities, companies and
organisations — among them the <a href="/">Free Software Foundation Europe</a>
(FSFE) — set out to change this in 2001.</p>

<p>Version 1.0 of AGNULA was finally released in early 2004.</p>

<p>AGNULA managed to be accepted as European Commission project IST-2001-34879
and was funded from April 1st, 2002 until March 31st, 2004. The project was
coordinated by Nicola Bernardini from Centro Tempo Reale, Florence, Italy.</p>

<p>The project was finished to the full satisfaction of the European Commission
and you can <a

read the final article about AGNULA on the IST results page</a> of the European
Commission.</p>


<h3>FSFE Contributions</h3>

<p>One seminal role of the FSFE inside the AGNULA EU project was to take care
of the legal issues, decide upon acceptable licensing policies and care about
legal maintainability. Other tasks were making sure that Free Software
community interests are heard, helping that information is provided in the best
possible way and work on the dissemination of the final results:</p>
