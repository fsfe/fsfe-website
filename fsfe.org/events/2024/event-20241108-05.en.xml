      <p>The role of Deputy Coordinator Italy within the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) was born in 2022 out of the need of re-establishing the presence of the Foundation on the territory. I designed this three years experimental project together with the Free Software Lab of NOI Techpark with the value proposition of (re)designing the FSFE Italian Community.<br />
The project followed a human centric approach, moving along the five core stages of design-thinking. The goal of Marta Andreoli from the FSFE is to describe the FSFE Italy project and the design-thinking approach adopted.</p>
