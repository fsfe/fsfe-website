The Asian Legal Networkâ€™s inaugural conference is taking place today,
March 14, 2014.  This by invitation only event - the Asian Legal and
Licensing Workshop - is an important opportunity for members to meet
and discuss the future of the Asian Free Software market from a legal
perspective. The workshop features speeches and discussions with
select lawyers and experts involved in GNU/Linux and Free Software,
including Karsten Gerloff (FSFE), Keith Bergelt (OIN), Linda Biel
(AST), and Xinzhu Zhang (Global Economics Group).

through which FSFE has been facilitating an ongoing conversation among
the world's leading legal experts on Free Software since 2006.
