   About the Free Software Foundation Europe:

     The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is a charitable
     non-governmental organisation dedicated to all aspects of Free Software in
     Europe. Access to software determines who may participate in a digital
     society. Therefore the Freedoms to use, copy, modify and redistribute
     software - as described in the Free Software definition- allow equal
     participation in the information age. Creating awareness for these issues,
     securing Free Software politically and legally, and giving people Freedom
     by supporting development of Free Software are central issues of the FSFE.
     The FSFE was founded in 2001 as the European sister organisation of the
     Free Software Foundation in the United States.
