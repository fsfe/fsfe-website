    <title>AVM GPL violation</title>
    <description>
      Can a company modify GPL-licensed software on a third-party
      device? The router manufacturer AVM accused Cybits of copyright
      infringement and trademark claims because they modify the
      original router firmware which is largely based on the Linux
      kernel. Together with gpl-violations.org we successfully
      convinced the court that the provisions in the GPL license are
      binding: software under this license can be freely modified and
      installed even if it is shipped as part of an embedded device's
      firmware.
