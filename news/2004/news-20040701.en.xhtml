      Free Software "...should be seen, then, as more than just a different
      kind of product. It is a different kind of process for building,
      maintaining and changing the rules that govern information flows." -
      according to the United Nations.

      The institution working for Free Software in Europe is the Free Software
      Foundation Europe (FSFE). Its success is well known: "The Free Software
      Foundation makes a great job - for example for the legal protection of
      Free Software developers. That is why we support FSFE", says Paul
      Salazar, director of marketing for the GNU/Linux Distributor Red Hat in
      Europe, the middle East and Africa. He is not alone with this positive
      view.  Says Horst Nebgen, Vice President, Novell, Central Europe and
      Managing Director, Novell, Germany: "Novell released the installation and
      configuration tool "YAST" (yet another setup tool) under the GPL (GNU
      General Public License), to make it accessible for every developer. The
      GPL - and therefore the FSFE by which it is published, maintained and
      protected - guarantees transparency and independence from a platform.
      This assures that through its ability to innovate, the already proverbial
      stability, security and broad network support continue to evolve and
      advance. Therefore for Novell, the Free Software Foundation Europe is an
      important partner on its way into the future.

      "We are of course very happy about this praise", says Georg Greve,
      President of the FSFE. "What makes this public appreciation particularly
      significant is that the FSFE never spared with criticism of these very
      companies when it seemed necessary. Obviously the job done by the FSFE is
      appreciated even if we are uncomfortable at times. This independence from
      politics, industry and other associations is a prerequisite for our
      present successes and the basis for our continued work."
    </p>

      The projects of the FSFE are multifaceted: participation in the German
      government's delegation at the "World Summit on the Information Society
      (WSIS)", consulting with the European Union during the establishment of
      the framework programmes, participation in AGNULA, a project to build a
      fully Free Software distribution for professional musicians and
      multimedia authors and also the maintenance and advancement of the GNU
      General Public License (GPL).  This diversity costs a lot of money:
      travels round the world, production of information and marketing
      material, personnel cost.
    </p>

      The FSFE Coordinator for Germany, Bernhard Reiter, illustrates the
      background: "We want to pursue our projects at the highest level.
      Moreover we observe an increasing demand for support of the public: we
      are asked to give speeches and to consult on licensing Free Software. We
      would like to do all of this. But without
      <a href="/help/donate.html">funding</a> our hands are tied.
