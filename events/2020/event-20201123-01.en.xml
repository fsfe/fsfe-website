        <title>FSFE Netherlands online get-together (online) (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>On the 23th of November the FSFE Netherlands will have another localgroup meeting. Like last time it will be held online, so that despite missing our regular physical meeting we keep in touch. The meeting will be from 20:00 until 21:00 CET on the conference server. Last time is was very 'gezellig' and so most stayed until 22:30, but that is optional of course. The meeting is open for everybody. To join the meeting please send an email to Nico Rikken (nico[dot]rikken[at]fsfe[dot]org), he will send you the meeting link and access code. We intend to have a sneak preview of the translated Public Money? Public Code! video before release.</p>
