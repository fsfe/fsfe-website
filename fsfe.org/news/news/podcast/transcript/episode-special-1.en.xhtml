Unfortunately, as we do this podcast remotely this time, we cannot provide the same level

00:06.160 --&gt; 00:09.400
of audio quality as you are used to in this podcast.

00:09.400 --&gt; 00:14.720
We apologize for this and will look into better solutions for remote recordings for future

00:14.720 --&gt; 00:15.560
episodes.

00:30.560 --&gt; 00:34.160
Welcome to the sixth episode of the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:34.160 --&gt; 00:37.840
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:37.840 --&gt; 00:41.120
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:41.120 --&gt; 00:44.560
I'm Matthias Kirschner, I'm the president of the Free Software Foundation Europe

00:44.560 --&gt; 00:46.880
and I'm doing this podcast with Bonnie Merring.

00:46.880 --&gt; 00:52.080
Hello, in times where the corona virus spreads around the world, every country is busy with

00:52.080 --&gt; 00:57.520
countering or preparing the healthcare system for this crisis. Software is a crucial tool

00:57.520 --&gt; 01:00.320
that can support humankind in this challenge.

01:00.320 --&gt; 01:04.320
In this episode, we will focus on one of such tools, new health.

01:04.320 --&gt; 01:07.600
New health is the Libre Health and Hospital Information System.

01:07.600 --&gt; 01:11.120
Our guests for today are Dr. Axel Brown and Dr. Louis Falcon.

01:11.120 --&gt; 01:15.680
Louis Falcon is the founder of the new Solidario and the author of Knew Health.

01:15.680 --&gt; 01:19.920
Axel Brown published the first Knew Health life city and is deeply involved in the Knew Health

01:19.920 --&gt; 01:22.640
project. So welcome Axel and welcome Louis.

01:23.600 --&gt; 01:27.200
Thank you, Matthias and thank you, Bonnie, for inviting us over here

01:27.200 --&gt; 01:30.480
and presenting new health to the Free Software hackers.

01:31.520 --&gt; 01:32.560
Yeah, and likewise.

01:32.560 --&gt; 01:36.480
Axel, can you start with briefly introducing what Knew Health is in general?

01:37.360 --&gt; 01:42.960
Knew Health is a fully featured health and hospital information and management system.

01:43.680 --&gt; 01:50.640
So we can distinguish for different areas of functionality or for different layers which

01:50.640 --&gt; 01:56.880
all build on top of each other. The first area is the area of social medicine.

01:56.880 --&gt; 02:00.960
Here we look at an individual before he becomes a patient.

02:00.960 --&gt; 02:06.560
So we can look how he's living at his housing conditions, what his family relationships are,

02:07.440 --&gt; 02:15.520
what his socioeconomic lifestyle is and so on. As soon as he becomes a patient and has to enter

02:15.520 --&gt; 02:21.760
a hospital or a health practitioner's office or something like that, we do the full recording

02:21.760 --&gt; 02:30.080
of his medical record with all activities involved. So the diagnosis, the prescriptions,

02:31.280 --&gt; 02:36.560
the health situation, the history and everything around.

02:37.680 --&gt; 02:44.320
The next layer is the area of managing a hospital or a practitioner's office.

02:44.880 --&gt; 02:50.800
So there we have everything that you need. For example, management of housing, of beds,

02:50.800 --&gt; 02:56.480
of operation rooms, surgery rooms, of health professionals, of pharmacy.

02:57.440 --&gt; 03:04.400
We have a laboratory module. We have connectors to external systems like PACSERVERS.

03:05.040 --&gt; 03:09.520
These are servers that manage medical images and something like that.

03:10.800 --&gt; 03:15.600
Or the interconnection layer of financial accounting, supply chain management and so on.

03:16.240 --&gt; 03:23.680
And last but not least, we have the area of reporting where we focus mainly on the

03:23.680 --&gt; 03:30.000
Ministry of Health and their reporting needs, but as well as local authorities and hospital

03:30.000 --&gt; 03:35.200
management. That's really interesting. And here at Lewis, that you were the author of,

03:35.200 --&gt; 03:38.800
can you have, how and why did you get the idea for it?

03:39.360 --&gt; 03:47.360
New health starts in the north of Argentina in 2006. We were actually doing implementations

03:47.360 --&gt; 03:55.440
or deploying new Linux systems on rural schools. That gave me the idea to put together

03:55.440 --&gt; 04:05.600
my background as a computer scientist and in medicine to work on social medicine and help

04:05.680 --&gt; 04:11.920
the rural doctors to improve the determinants of health for their population.

04:11.920 --&gt; 04:22.000
And that was the initial idea behind new health to work on social medicine and to work on primary care.

04:22.640 --&gt; 04:31.040
And then within the years, we have seen how it has evolved to a full-blown health and hospital

04:32.000 --&gt; 04:36.800
Lewis, can you briefly explain to our listeners what you understand under social medicine?

04:37.360 --&gt; 04:47.360
By social medicine, we talk about all those determinants of health related to the socio-economic

04:47.360 --&gt; 04:57.360
conditions of a person or a society. We could say that social medicine prevents social diseases.

04:58.320 --&gt; 05:07.680
If we look today, we have over 20,000 children that die every single day from social diseases.

05:07.680 --&gt; 05:15.440
What does it mean? We look at tuberculosis, we look at jagged disease, we look at war, we look at

05:15.440 --&gt; 05:23.680
prostitution, we look at modern world slavery, all of those are social diseases.

05:24.400 --&gt; 05:34.480
And what we do with new health, it's making sure that we have the tools to capture all those

05:34.480 --&gt; 05:42.560
hot spots, homeless people, overcrowding conditions of those houses, domestic violence.

05:43.680 --&gt; 05:48.400
If we don't tackle those issues, we are not doing inventive medicine.

05:49.360 --&gt; 05:56.960
Because if you don't do that, what you are doing, it's working on the areas of the system of disease.

05:56.960 --&gt; 06:05.440
And that's what most countries in the Western world do, erroneously, on my humble opinion.

06:05.440 --&gt; 06:11.520
Because what you are doing today in most health systems is not preventive medicine.

06:11.520 --&gt; 06:16.640
You are doing reactive medicine. You are trying to cure somebody that is already sick.

06:17.440 --&gt; 06:22.720
And if somebody is already sick, probably, and we have seen perfectly, and I guess we'll talk

06:22.720 --&gt; 06:31.760
later about that in the COVID-19 pandemic. If you tackle the sources of the disease soon enough,

06:32.320 --&gt; 06:40.480
then you are doing good preventive medicine and you would detect the outbreaks before they become

06:40.480 --&gt; 06:47.760
an epidemic. You already mentioned COVID-19, and it's a huge challenge for the whole

06:47.760 --&gt; 06:53.040
healthcare system around the world. So I was wondering, what are your thoughts on your team,

06:53.040 --&gt; 07:02.560
and how do you deal with this situation? So it's a tragedy, right? It's a tragedy that, on my opinion,

07:02.560 --&gt; 07:12.960
we could have prevented as a humanity. COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2, it's a new virus,

07:13.760 --&gt; 07:22.000
but the same family of viruses, also, coronavirus, have been doing really bad epidemics,

07:22.560 --&gt; 07:29.600
but we have us epidemic, and then we had the nurse epidemic.

07:29.680 --&gt; 07:36.480
How could we have help with this? Well, mainly in different areas, as Axel was saying before,

07:36.480 --&gt; 07:45.200
we work on the concept of people before patients. We have all the domiciliar units. We know at

07:45.200 --&gt; 07:51.520
every single moment who lives where we have operational areas that divide the country or the

07:51.520 --&gt; 07:57.920
region, administrative sectors, where those are provinces, cities, and whatever. So each of

07:58.400 --&gt; 08:05.200
these administrative areas, we know are the hospitals are there. We know which health professionals

08:05.200 --&gt; 08:11.520
are active. The specialty of all these health professionals should we need them to go from one

08:11.520 --&gt; 08:18.640
place to the other. We know that nicity, the education level, the population density, population density

08:18.640 --&gt; 08:27.040
is key on COVID-19 and many other infectious diseases. We know that the higher the population

08:27.040 --&gt; 08:35.680
densities, the faster that the disease will spread. And guess what? The highest areas

08:36.640 --&gt; 08:45.520
or the most dense population are always on the slums. They are always on areas of poverty. All

08:45.520 --&gt; 08:53.200
those pockets of poverty and social exclusions are the areas or are the worst reservoirs

08:54.160 --&gt; 09:00.960
or contagious diseases. You know, just to give you an analogy, the ventilation of the houses.

09:01.840 --&gt; 09:07.360
You know in New Health, how many rooms do you have there? Is it well ventilated? How many people

09:07.360 --&gt; 09:11.360
is actually living there? Do you have good sanitary conditions? Do you have sewers?

09:12.080 --&gt; 09:20.160
So, and by the way, all of these is geo-referensated and geo-located linked to open street maps.

09:21.120 --&gt; 09:28.000
So, again, look at this. If we have all this information, we are doing preventive medicine.

09:28.720 --&gt; 09:36.000
We can track, we can do contact tracing when we have an index case. Imagine like this. Now,

09:36.000 --&gt; 09:44.240
we know that we need to do tests, right? To check the antibodies where they are early stage antibodies,

09:44.240 --&gt; 09:53.360
early infection stage antibodies, or where they are the IGG, and those are the memory antibodies.

09:53.360 --&gt; 10:01.680
So, if you are IGM or early stage infection antibody is positive, it means that you are going through

10:02.320 --&gt; 10:08.720
at this moment of active disease. Now, if you are IGG, that means that you already passed

10:09.520 --&gt; 10:17.840
the disease, you are most probably immune to that disease. So, in that case, you could go back to work.

10:18.720 --&gt; 10:27.840
And that's beautiful. So, we can do point-of-care testing with New Health in outpatient settings

10:28.560 --&gt; 10:35.920
and get that information. So, putting all of these together and Axel can talk more if he wants

10:35.920 --&gt; 10:42.400
about the inpatient settings and ICU and all that. But all of these that I'm talking now,

10:42.400 --&gt; 10:49.360
it's all about preventing the disease and the pandemic to actually spread further.

10:50.000 --&gt; 10:57.680
And that is a key that distinguishes New Health from other hospital management information

10:57.680 --&gt; 11:06.720
systems because we before tackling the disease, we tackle the causes and the source, the root

11:06.720 --&gt; 11:13.200
that generate that disease. And that is doing good primary care program, that is doing good

11:13.760 --&gt; 11:18.080
public health program, health promotion and disease prevention.

11:19.120 --&gt; 11:21.120
Axel, do you have anything to add here?

11:21.120 --&gt; 11:26.960
Question was how do we think about it and what could we do about it? I mean, what we're trying

11:26.960 --&gt; 11:34.240
is to network with other parties. For example, there was a press release about one or two weeks ago

11:34.880 --&gt; 11:42.720
about the German company Bush wanted to release an analytic device that should do a corona test

11:42.720 --&gt; 11:51.360
in about two hours, which would be a tremendous increase because currently you need a couple of days

11:51.440 --&gt; 11:58.080
until you get a result. So I got a contact with Bush and asked them, look guys, we have a

11:58.080 --&gt; 12:04.960
free health and hospital information system here. So we can immediately take your testing result,

12:04.960 --&gt; 12:11.680
put them into the database, analyze them and do all the necessary steps behind it.

12:12.240 --&gt; 12:19.360
Wouldn't it be an ideal combination if we can interface to your device and so build a nice

12:19.360 --&gt; 12:26.240
little package, which will be especially interesting for emerging countries, not for the developed

12:26.240 --&gt; 12:33.680
countries, like we have them here in Europe or North America, but mainly focusing on the emerging

12:33.680 --&gt; 12:43.840
countries where we expect an explosion of the infection rate in the next weeks. Yeah, having said

12:44.000 --&gt; 12:49.760
this, I got at least the confirmation that the email was received, but nothing more up to now,

12:49.760 --&gt; 12:55.600
unfortunately. Is it in general that new health is mainly used in the countries you call

12:55.600 --&gt; 13:02.000
emerging countries or where is it mainly used? Yes, basically it's used all around the world.

13:02.000 --&gt; 13:08.800
As Louis said, the starting point was South America and Argentina. So it is used in various

13:08.800 --&gt; 13:15.200
hospitals there. We have corporations with the University there and 30 years, for example,

13:15.200 --&gt; 13:21.680
on the development of new health. We have currently a couple of projects going on in Africa,

13:21.680 --&gt; 13:28.960
together with World Health Organization and the local ministries of health. We have implementations

13:28.960 --&gt; 13:37.120
in Middle East, for example, in Pakistan. In India, big implementations going on at the moment

13:37.920 --&gt; 13:46.800
and, for example, one of the oldest implementations is in Laos, the Center for Medical Rehabilitation,

13:46.800 --&gt; 13:54.160
where they are taking care about people who are suffering from unexploded ordinances from the Vietnam

13:54.160 --&gt; 14:04.480
War. In developed countries like Europe, there we have a high level of regulation. So if you look

14:04.560 --&gt; 14:10.640
at Germany, for example, first of all, you need a certification if you want to deal with a public

14:10.640 --&gt; 14:17.440
health system. We have two implementations from which we know in Germany. One is a charitable

14:17.440 --&gt; 14:25.520
organization. They are giving medical help for homeless, for refugees, for people without health

14:25.520 --&gt; 14:32.640
insurance and something like that, and they use new health to record their patients and the diagnosis

14:32.880 --&gt; 14:39.760
and so on. And the other implementation is with an alternative practitioner who is only,

14:40.480 --&gt; 14:49.280
let's say, bill-private patients. So both are not in relation and have no connection with the

14:49.280 --&gt; 14:54.880
public health system. If you want to do business with the public health system, you need to have

14:54.880 --&gt; 15:01.760
certain certifications. And as long as nobody stands up and say, look, we think this is interesting,

15:02.320 --&gt; 15:09.440
and we want to pay for the certifications, we're probably not going to do it. So if by chance Mr. Spahn

15:09.440 --&gt; 15:16.960
is listening, if he wants to spend some money in a sensible way, or if directive to the

15:16.960 --&gt; 15:25.440
schematic, it would probably be a piece of cake for them to put the certification in place for

15:25.440 --&gt; 15:30.400
new health, because it's all open and free software, so it should be easy for them to do that.

15:31.120 --&gt; 15:38.880
But at the moment, we see not many interests from side of the European Ministry of Health,

15:38.880 --&gt; 15:46.240
unfortunately. Do you see a way how this could be fixed? That is now interested from the European

15:46.240 --&gt; 15:51.520
Health Commission. Yeah, I mean, the public sector is not straightforward with their open-source

15:51.520 --&gt; 15:59.200
strategy. The German Christ Democrats have this now decided, basically, that if they develop

15:59.200 --&gt; 16:05.040
software from public money, it should be released as source software, which is basically the

16:05.040 --&gt; 16:10.720
public money, public code initiative, also driven from the free software foundation, Europe.

16:10.720 --&gt; 16:18.560
I think this is a good approach, but the difficult thing is the way how free software comes into

16:18.560 --&gt; 16:24.480
a company or into the public sector is completely different from the way it works with business

16:24.480 --&gt; 16:29.920
software or proprietary software. So if you send out a request for information and say, look,

16:29.920 --&gt; 16:37.360
I'm going to install a new ERP system and what are your offers? Then it takes two days and you

16:37.360 --&gt; 16:42.880
have the sales troops already on your doorstep and telling you why this is the perfect system that

16:42.960 --&gt; 16:50.400
you just have to buy and you're done forever. Perfect, wonderful. That does not work with free software

16:50.400 --&gt; 16:57.520
because free software is not being sold to you. You have to become an active part and investigate

16:57.520 --&gt; 17:04.480
for information. You can of course ask in the community and so on, but there is nobody coming to

17:04.560 --&gt; 17:14.000
you and trying to sell you this. And this change of mind has to take place in the companies and

17:14.000 --&gt; 17:21.120
in the public sector. And I think before this change in the mindset is not taking place, we will not

17:21.120 --&gt; 17:27.600
be really successful with establishing free software in public institutions. I mean, there is free

17:27.600 --&gt; 17:32.320
software, I think, where when people hear someone is interested in that, you have people reaching

17:32.400 --&gt; 17:38.080
out to them and selling them their services. But for new health, how is it looking there? I mean,

17:38.080 --&gt; 17:44.800
how are you financing yourself and what people are you having involved in your team? So is it mainly

17:44.800 --&gt; 17:53.280
coders there or mainly doctors or how is it your team set up? We have a mixed team. We have a

17:53.280 --&gt; 18:00.960
couple of medical doctors, of course. We have people from universities involved. I'm for example,

18:00.960 --&gt; 18:07.920
I'm coming from a consulting background. I've spent many years in the ERP business and have

18:07.920 --&gt; 18:16.080
done development there as well. The finance thing is of course an issue because we are fully

18:16.080 --&gt; 18:25.680
financed only from donations. Recently received first small donation from the public sector,

18:26.480 --&gt; 18:34.240
local health ministry. But besides this, we are only having donations from individuals mostly

18:34.240 --&gt; 18:41.200
and of course a lot of volunteer work. When Lewis was explaining all this with with new health

18:41.200 --&gt; 18:47.760
and how it's using a lot of data and a lot of all the private data from the living circumstances

18:47.760 --&gt; 18:53.440
of people, I can imagine that there are some countries where, for example, Germany, where you

18:53.440 --&gt; 19:00.800
also live, where people react a little bit like, oh, that's a huge privacy concern. So how do you

19:00.800 --&gt; 19:05.520
tackle that? On one side, you can benefit from a lot of data there, but on the other hand,

19:05.520 --&gt; 19:10.720
when a lot of this data is gathered, how do you make sure that a system like new health that doesn't

19:10.720 --&gt; 19:19.360
turn into a surveillance tool for some countries? Yeah, it's a very interesting and a very important

19:19.360 --&gt; 19:27.680
question. So first of all, we are taking widely-except standards, for example, for data encryption.

19:28.400 --&gt; 19:39.440
So we're using new PG as the tool to sign data, certificates or prescriptions or to encrypt data.

19:40.080 --&gt; 19:45.600
And we could encrypt data down to the lowest field level, basically, if this is needed.

19:46.560 --&gt; 19:54.000
But if we have a fully encrypted database, we could probably not take benefit from

19:54.800 --&gt; 20:02.880
interrelations between data records, the data analytical part. So here we need to draw an abstraction

20:02.880 --&gt; 20:11.280
layer in between that allows us to analyze the data, but on the other hand, not go back onto

20:11.280 --&gt; 20:20.160
an individual, because we are very concerned about data privacy. And unfortunately,

20:20.160 --&gt; 20:27.680
what we've seen up to now is that always, let's say, comfort, beads, security, and privacy.

20:28.960 --&gt; 20:36.000
So the people do not really take care about the value of their data, and I mean the current data,

20:36.960 --&gt; 20:43.040
general data protection regulations as we have them now are in many areas really over the top.

20:43.760 --&gt; 20:51.360
But I feel in some areas they are completely right. For example, that I have the right to ask

20:51.920 --&gt; 21:00.320
each company or each local ministry about the data that is stored about myself and that I have

21:00.800 --&gt; 21:06.480
the right for fortification. Thank you all. But for the overview of new health and how this could

21:06.480 --&gt; 21:13.360
help with the pandemic, I was wondering what are your next steps, especially in regard to the

21:13.360 --&gt; 21:19.600
current pandemic. Are you planning to implement any new tools in new health? We already have

21:19.600 --&gt; 21:27.760
updated new health with ICD 10 codes of the pandemic. Now we can also, if you do point of

21:28.240 --&gt; 21:36.080
testing, you can certify and associate the health condition with that code itself. So as I said,

21:36.080 --&gt; 21:41.680
from public health point of view, it's very good because at that point, you could say, well,

21:41.680 --&gt; 21:48.000
this person is already immune because he went through and he passed the disease and he has developed

21:48.000 --&gt; 21:55.440
the antibodies and so on. And on the other hand, we are working with the community in having new

21:56.400 --&gt; 22:02.880
health implemented with telemedicine where, you know, you can use the federation or the

22:02.880 --&gt; 22:09.520
new health mobile application that that's what we are doing now on QT. So, you know, the person can

22:09.520 --&gt; 22:18.960
do this rapid test from his house and also allow primary care physicians to give instructions

22:19.040 --&gt; 22:25.440
on in an outpatient settings because, you know, new health is also embedded. So with the Raspberry

22:25.440 --&gt; 22:33.200
PI, for example, they can have the new health on their houses and communicate with whether

22:33.200 --&gt; 22:41.760
is the health professional or the nurse and do a quick assessment on their health status from

22:41.760 --&gt; 22:48.400
remote. So, you don't compromise those health professionals. The solutions are there. The

22:48.400 --&gt; 22:53.920
technical functionality is there. We just need the government to listen to us.

22:55.520 --&gt; 22:57.920
Axel, do you want to add anything to this?

22:57.920 --&gt; 23:04.960
Yeah, in terms of next steps, we have all the measures in place. We are ICD-10 encoded, including

23:05.520 --&gt; 23:12.080
the latest encoding for Corona. So, everything is really there. There are some developments going

23:12.080 --&gt; 23:19.680
on. For example, at the moment, we are working together with the KDE project on a mobile client

23:19.680 --&gt; 23:29.840
for new health using Kirigami and plasma technology. The federation server, which is the model

23:29.920 --&gt; 23:38.320
that can be used to connect multiple nodes like health information systems or smaller subsets

23:38.320 --&gt; 23:43.760
running on a Raspberry PI, like Luis mentioned beforehand, that are reporting into this federation

23:43.760 --&gt; 23:54.320
server is being developed further in terms of reporting facilities and other projects that are

23:55.120 --&gt; 24:03.120
have a public funding, for example, Opememis, which is an insurance management tool for

24:03.760 --&gt; 24:10.240
public health care sector. Thank you, Axel. Thank you, Luis. Unfortunately, we are already

24:10.800 --&gt; 24:18.160
coming to an end. As in every podcast, I would like to ask the two of you if there are any free

24:18.160 --&gt; 24:24.080
software developers, contributors or free software projects you would like to thank. Because that's

24:24.080 --&gt; 24:30.400
what we always encourage people in February to do, but I think especially in times when

24:30.400 --&gt; 24:35.120
humankind is under threat like this. It's important to not forget to say thank you to others

24:35.120 --&gt; 24:42.240
who contribute there. So, Luis, is there any individual or project out there you would like to thank?

24:42.240 --&gt; 24:49.760
Oh, it would be endless. You would take me another hour to thank all the people from Python

24:49.760 --&gt; 24:58.560
community, LibreOffice where we've done some reporting, Flask, the KDE, and also from the research

24:58.560 --&gt; 25:06.480
community, the European Bioinformatic Institute that is having all the protein natural variants,

25:06.480 --&gt; 25:12.800
so important on genomics that we use in new health and genetic diseases, you know, all the research

25:13.680 --&gt; 25:20.720
community around the world that allow us to build this project, a big thank you, and of course,

25:20.720 --&gt; 25:26.320
at this moment, big thank you to all health professionals around the world that are giving

25:26.320 --&gt; 25:34.400
their lives for curing and accompanying the people that is going through the COVID-19 disease,

25:34.400 --&gt; 25:40.400
a big hug to all of them. So, next to the ones that Luis mentioned already, which would

25:40.480 --&gt; 25:46.880
on my favorite list as well, I would like to add two projects, first of all, GNU-P, because with

25:46.880 --&gt; 25:53.600
their technology, they're one of the defenders of a privacy in general, and second of all, I would

25:53.600 --&gt; 26:00.240
like to thank the OpenSUSA project, because they're a regular sponsor of new health conferences,

26:00.960 --&gt; 26:07.760
and they are the only distribution that's shipping GNU health already in their system standard

26:08.240 --&gt; 26:13.360
right now. Thank you. Thank you very much, Axel, thank you very much, Luis, for being with us on

26:13.360 --&gt; 26:20.160
this podcast. Yeah, thanks, Bonnie and Matthias, and keep the good work of the free software foundation

26:20.160 --&gt; 26:27.200
Europe up. I think we have to challenge our politicians with free software. Thank you for that.

26:27.840 --&gt; 26:33.840
Thank you for having us, Bonnie and Matthias, it's been a real pleasure, and thank you for putting

26:33.920 --&gt; 26:41.600
the accent again on public health care, and keep up the excellent job you're doing with your

26:41.600 --&gt; 26:48.160
