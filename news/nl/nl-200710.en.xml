      Topics:
Welcome to FSFE's October newsletter. This month, issues of
interoperability, sustainable ICT and Free Software in education
have been receiving attention. There are also changes inside FSFE,
with the Fellowship reviewing its infrastructure and long-term
projects like the FTF European Legal and Technical networks continuing
to expand. Exciting times indeed.
