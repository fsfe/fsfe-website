    <title>Software Freedom Day booth in Vienna</title>
    <body>
      <p>
The Vienna fellowship group will hold a booth in the very busy city
centre of Vienna on the corner of the Mariahilfer Sta√üe and the
Museumsquartier. From 10am until 7pm we will be answering questions at
our information desk and giving out leaflets and live CDs from different
free operating systems. Many of them with a specially produced
CD-edition identifying the FSFE fellowship as provider of the copies. We
will bring notebook computers as well to show interested passers-by how
well Free Software works and how good it looks.
