        <title>European approaches towards a Sustainable Digitalization (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>In a Workshop we will address several question on how to engage civil society to work on EU level. How can civil society increase pressure on the EU and its member states to make digitalization more sustainable? How can an integrated agenda for sustainable digitalization carried by European civil society organizations look like? What could be joint activities? FSFE's Alexander Sander will talk about advocating on EU level. </p>
