      "The youth at the Elizabeth Peabody House enjoyed the reading of Ada &amp; Zangemann. It was a fun and engaging read; vivid illustrations, colors, and details on each page kept them excited for what came next. The youth could relate to Ada, as they are full of great, creative ideas; that they hope to bring to life too"
