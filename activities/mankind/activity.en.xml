    <title>Classification of Free Software as a World Cultural Heritage</title>
    <description>
      The objectives were to have Free Software classified as an intangible
      world cultural heritage by the UNESCO, and registered in the World
      Memory Register (another UNESCO project). The Free Software
      community and the UNESCO share the same freedom, equality and
      fraternity values. Such a recognition would be a great promotion
      of Free Software.
