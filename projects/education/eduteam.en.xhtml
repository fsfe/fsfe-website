	<h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>
	To speed up and increase communication in the educational
       field, the Free Software Foundation Europe has created an
       educational task force.
			</p>

			<p>
			Our specific tasks include:
      </p>

      <ul>

	<li>
	  networking Free Software in Education efforts and energies
	to connect people, thus avoiding duplication of efforts (i.e.,
	there are three databases with free edu software);
	</li>
	<li>
	  spreading information about Free Software in Education;
	</li>
	<li>
	  spreading information about the importance of software
	freedoms;
	  </li>
	<li>
	  communicating important news through the <a
	  href="mailto:edu-team@fsfeurope.org">edu-team@fsfeurope.org</a>
	  mailing list.
	</li>

      </ul>
			<a name="members" />
			<h3>Members</h3>

			The team is currently being reshaped and we are looking for volunteers.

			 <h3>Get Involved</h3>
			 
      <p>
	If you want to be part of this effort (which means that you
	are devoted to it, not just observing), we have some
	requirements:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  experience with GNU/Linux, Free Software and education;
	</li>
	<li>
	  a clear "No" to non-free software;
	</li>
	<li>
	  advantageous: previous work in that field;
	</li>
	<li>
	  you should live in Europe (i.e. NA, India and China have
	  their own FSF educational efforts, so please join them if
	  you live there).
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	The task force can be reached via
	<a href="mailto:edu-team@fsfeurope.org">edu-team@fsfeurope.org</a>.
