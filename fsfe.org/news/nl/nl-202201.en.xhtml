<h1>Device Neutrality becomes a reality +++ Stockholm +++ FSFE infrastructure +++ AI </h1>
  
  <p>
	In our January Newsletter, we recognise the importance of the 
	Digital Markets Act as a mostly positive development for software 
	freedom. Read how the lack of public code cost Stockholm €100 
	million. Our System Hackers team unravel what lies behind the FSFE 
	infrastructure. Vincent Lequertier stresses that AI needs 
	transparency. FOSDEM is coming up.
  </p>

<h2>Device Neutrality finally becomes a reality</h2>
  
  <p>
	The European Parliament adopted the Digital Markets Act, which <a href="/news/2021/news-20211215-01.html">introduces 
	the principle of Device Neutrality</a>. This is a major first step. 
	The right for end-users to use their own device and operating 
	system is an important factor to guarantee access of Free Software 
	operating systems to dominant platforms. As a daily reality for 
	many users, this option enlarges the audience for Free Software 
	adoption.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Digital Markets Act protects the users as it requires stricter 
    consent for pre-installed apps, it aims to prevent vendor lock-in, 
    and it requires real time data portability. However, we regret that 
    the voting has not contemplated setting Open Standards as the 
    default to define interoperability.
  </p>

<h2>Lack of public code cost the city of Stockholm €100 million</h2>
  
  <p>
    Parents in Stockholm receive information about their children's 
    schools or kindergartens directly to their devices with the help of 
    Skolplattformen ('School platform'), a digital platform offered by 
    the city of Stockholm. It cost an estimated €100 million and 
    although it was publicly funded, Skolplattformen's code was 
    private. Parents spotted irregularities and security issues in the 
    platform and proceeded to fix the flaws themselves. They created a 
    functional and secure Free Software alternative, Öppna 
    skolplattformen ('Open school platform'). The city of Stockholm 
    took legal measures against the developers who wanted to help.

    We <a href="/news/2021/news-20211216-01.html">interviewed 
    Christian Landberg and Alexander Crawford, two major contributors 
    behind the initiative</a>. According to Alexander Crawford, Öppna 
    skolplattformen changes the conversation around civic tech and 
    digitalisation of the public sector.

<h2>Infrastructure living the ideals of software freedom</h2>
  
<p>
    Can organisations with limited resources be digitally sovereign and 
    still provide modern services? It is not trivial, but the FSFE 
    proves it is possible. We have maximized our control over services 
    and servers by using Free Software. We demonstrate internal and 
    external transparency. The complexity of our systems is bearable, 
    while we provide a variety of useful features.

    The FSFE shares an overview of its digital infrastructure in an <a href="/news/2021/news-20211203-01.html">article</a> 
    that could help other NGOs become independent from proprietary 
    service providers. Let us take you on a journey through our 
    infrastructure and its principles, from shiny user interfaces of 
    our services, crossing the virtualisation methods and monitoring, 
    down to the bare metal servers they are running on. Our 
    infrastructure is managed by the System Hackers team.

<h2>Interview with Vincent Lequertier on AI</h2>
  
  <p>
    Vincent Lequertier is a member of the System Hackers team and a 
    researcher of artificial intelligence for healthcare. For 20 years 
    FSFE, <a href="/news/2021/news-20211209-01.html">we 
    interviewed Vincent about crucial aspects of artificial 
    intelligence</a>. Transparency in AI is necessary to evaluate and 
    understand how data is processed and how results are calculated. 
    Free Software can play a crucial role in making AI more 
    transparent.

  <p>
    Vincent notes that in the health sector some aggregated statistics 
    are widely available. According to his estimate, openness and 
    collaborative aspects of research on AI will improve. The interview 
    unravels cutting edge topics such as the possibility of AI 
    obtaining the legal right to claim copyright.

       On Wednesday 19 January, the FSFE Netherlands country team will 
       have its monthly <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/Netherlands/2022-01-19">online 
       get-together</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
       On Saturday 5 and Sunday 6 February FOSDEM 2022 will take 
       place online, and the FSFE will co-organise the Legal and Policy 
       Devroom again. Last year we co-organised the Legal and Policy 
       Devroom for the first time; it included <a href="/news/2021/news-20210311-01.html">11 
       talks on a rich variety of topics</a>. We look forward to 
       FOSDEM 2022. Join us to learn the latest developments in 
       software freedom. Stay tuned for the schedule.

<h2>What we have done</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      On 28 December, Alexander Sander, FSFE&#39;s Policy Consultant, 
      gave a talk about “Public Money? Public Code! during corona 
      times&quot; at the rC3 conference.
    </li>
    <li>
      On 16 December, Lina Ceballos, an FSFE Project Manager, 
      participated in an online session about some of the FSFE&#39;s 
      main activities with a focus on &quot;Public Money? Public 
      Code!&quot; and its current status in Spain and in Europe. The 
      talk took place at Trantor Tech Talks; a <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/6AnT1Z2zeCzdskVL3tZw7Z">video is 
      available in Spanish</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      In December, community members published three posts in Planet. A 
      book review of Cory Doctorow‘s novel “Walkaway” praises the 
      story-telling despite a personal distaste for fantasy around 
      “mind scan” technology. An instructional post demonstrates how to 
      disable your internal keyboard/touchpad when a cat arrives. A 
      celebratory post announces the release of PGPainless version 
      1.0.0. You can read the thoughts of the FSFE community in <a href="https://planet.fsfe.org/">Planet</a>.
