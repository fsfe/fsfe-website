  <p>
    What are my options if I want to run my phone with Free Software? 
    For our Upcycling Android campaign we interviewed Plasma Mobile 
    developer Bhushan Shah about running a privacy-respecting and 
    secure GNU/Linux phone ecosystem on your phone.
  </p>

 <p>
   KDE is an international Free Software community founded in 1996, and 
   KDE e.V. is an associated organisation of the FSFE.  In 2014, KDE 
   first released Plasma, a graphical workspace environment which 
   became one of its core projects. Plasma Mobile is a Plasma 5 variant 
   for Linux-based smartphones. Bhushan Shah is a developer in the 
   Plasma Mobile project since 2015. We chatted with Bhushan to learn 
   more about this promising project. In this interview Bhushan 
   explains why using Plasma Mobile benefits one's privacy, and how to 
   get started. Enjoy!

  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: Hello Bhushan ðŸ™‚ thank you for joining!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Bhushan Shah</span></strong>: Hello! Good morning! ðŸ™‚
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: As a start we would like to learn a few 
    things about you, like how did you first become interested in Free 
    Software and how did you start working at Plasma Mobile?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Bhushan</span></strong>: Sure. My first exposure to Free Software 
    was a Linux course at University, which made me interested in Linux 
    and open source in general. As part of that I started writing 
    articles for Linux news sites (Muktware), and that introduced me to 
    the KDE community. Basically, as I grew closer to the KDE community 
    as a user I started using my development skills to contribute back, 
    and then I never looked back. I was working with the KDE community 
    as a contributor when they announced Plasma Mobile, and I was hired 
    to work on Plasma Mobile by Bluesystems GmbH. That was in 2015, and 
    after that I grew much closer to the Plasma Mobile project, both in 
    technical terms and as a &quot;movement&quot; to provide an open 
    alternative to Android/iOS ðŸ™‚
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: What is your current role in Plasma Mobile?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Bhushan</span></strong>: Currently I am working as a developer and 
    maintainer of the Plasma Mobile project. I should note that being 
    the maintainer does not make me BDFL* ðŸ˜‰ and responsibility for each 
    of the components still stays with all contributors. ðŸ™‚
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: Perfect, because we would like you to share 
    with us what is Plasma Mobile? How is it different to other mobile 
    operating systems? Pretend we hear about Free Software for the 
    first time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Bhushan</span></strong>: Right. In purely technical terms, Plasma 
    Mobile is a collection of various software components, but I&#39;d 
    like to think of it more as a ecosystem of mobile software which is 
    open by nature and has a community-first approach.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Other mobile operating systems like Android and iOS have 
    development done behind closed doors by large corporations and will 
    only provide new releases as a either huge code dump or will not 
    even provide a source code in some cases, while Plasma Mobile aims 
    to provide a complete transparent development process where each 
    change is developed together with the community, and is available 
    with licenses that allow anyone to use, inspect and develop onward.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Our goal is that every user, developer, designer, 
    translator can take part in the development and the community of 
    Plasma Mobile and can work on improving it</strong>. As for what 
    makes Plasma Mobile, again this is technical points, but Plasma 
    Mobile includes a shell or user interface, applications, and 
    distribution / base system for various mobile devices.

  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: Sounds like a vast collaborative project. We 
    would also like to learn what would you say to someone who has 
    decided to opt for a Free Software operating system, and has to 
    choose between an Android-based custom-ROM or a full GNU/Linux 
    distribution, like Plasma Mobile. What are the main differences, 
    and what should a user have in mind to make the right choice?
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Bhushan</span></strong>: Right, this is a question which will 
    yield 10 different answers if you ask 10 different people ðŸ˜„
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But ultimately it depends on what the user wants from their device. 
    There are <strong>some use cases, for example banking or mobile payment 
    applications, which unfortunately are not easily possible when you 
    use the full Linux based distribution</strong>, as the market for such 
    operating systems is still little bit of a niche and app developers 
    do not support these distributions. That said, there are solutions 
    like Waydroid which allow one to run such essential android 
    applications on the GNU/Linux system.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you do not have such use cases where you need an Android device 
    in your daily life then a full Linux-based system is definitely a 
    better choice, compared to let&#39;s say LineageOS or a de-googled 
    device, due to software freedoms it provides. So the bottom line 
    is, each user will have a different use case and while we can try 
    our best to match user expectation, ultimately the user will have 
    to make the decision here.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I think the main difference that will impact users is the app 
    ecosystem available to them.  While the Mobile Linux app ecosystem 
    is growing, unfortunately it is not anywhere close to what Android 
    and iOS have right now. We as a community and Free Software 
    enthusiasts will have to work on improving this aspect of the Free 
    Software mobile ecosystem. ðŸ™‚
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: Thanks. What is the quickest way to start 
    using Plasma Mobile? If I am looking to buy a new device and I am 
    interested in Plasma Mobile, what are my options?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Bhushan</span></strong>: There are certain vendors like Pine64 and 
    Purism, who have &quot;Linux first&quot; devices like PinePhone, 
    PinePhone Pro, and Librem 5 which should support the Plasma Mobile 
    without much hassle. Pine64 devices ship with Plasma Mobile as the 
    default even, but if these are not an option for you for whatever 
    reason, then the postmarketOS community is also working on adding 
    support for off-the-shelf Android devices in the mainline Linux 
    kernel.  You can find a<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices"> list of supported devices</a>
    in this page.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: Great. And once we have Plasma Mobile, what 
    are your most beloved apps you would recommend us?
  </p>  

  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Bhushan</span></strong>: Most distributions come with some basic 
    set of applications like Dialer, SMS application, Clock, Setting 
    applications etc. We have <a href="https://plasma-mobile.org/">a 
    list of applications on the Plasma Mobile website</a> that you can 
    go through.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My personal favourite, however, if you ask, is <a href="https://kdeconnect.kde.org/">KDE connect</a>  for interacting 
    and controlling other devices using Plasma Mobile devices ðŸ˜‰

  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: Plasma Mobile states to be a privacy 
    respecting phone ecosystem. How does Plasma Mobile secure 
    peoples&#39; privacy?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Bhushan</span></strong>: Right. A lot of applications and software 
    in the current mobile ecosystem are built with one basic aim of 
    tracking users and collecting multiple GBs of data about users. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Almost all of <strong>this is sold as &quot;Improving user 
    experience&quot; or &quot;features&quot; so users have no idea that 
    their data is being harvested</strong>. Do you want to activate 
    your phone with voice? Do you want to share your live location with 
    your friend? Do you maybe want to unlock your device with a 
    fingerprint or eye tracking?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Most users will say yes to this and Android/iOS will mine this 
    data, use it for targeted advertisements and in the worst case will 
    share with state actors who want to spy on users. We at Plasma 
    Mobile have committed to building a ecosystem where user privacy is 
    respected, Apart from opt-in very basic telemetry kde.org does not 
    collect any of the user data, and we work on adding the same set of 
    user enhancements without hidden data collection or targeted 
    advertisements.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition to this, being open by nature means that users are free 
    to audit the application/software installed on their device for any 
    anti-privacy features or hidden trackers ðŸ™‚
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: The contrast with the dominant mobile 
    ecosystems in matters of privacy is striking indeed. Going back to 
    other devices - GNU/Linux systems are famous for being able to run 
    on a variety of devices. Can I use Plasma mobile on other devices 
    except phones, or is that planned for the future?
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Bhushan</span></strong>: Yes, you can use Plasma Mobile on the 
    tablet/desktop devices as well. In fact a lot of us developers 
    develop Plasma Mobile by running it initially on the desktop ðŸ™‚ Some 
    distributions offer Live Images that you can boot on your laptop to 
    test drive Plasma Mobile.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: Sounds fun! As a last question, we would 
    like to ask you what motivates you in your work for Plasma Mobile?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Bhushan</span></strong>: My motivation is two-fold. First is I 
    very much believe in the vision of Plasma Mobile, and I would like 
    to help the KDE community achieve that goal, and my second 
    motivation is technology. I am a developer at heart and Plasma 
    Mobile is supported by various technologies and developing on it is 
    fun!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: Thank you Bhushan, for the interview and 
    also for offering us a privacy-friendly alternative to the current 
    mobile world. I wish all the best to the Plasma Mobile project, 
    which contributes to software freedom.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Bhushan</span></strong>: Thank you very much!
