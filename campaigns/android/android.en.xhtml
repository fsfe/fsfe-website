          Android is a <a
          href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html"
          title="Android and Users' Freedom">mostly free</a> operating system
          mainly developed by Google. Unfortunately, the drivers for most
          devices and most applications from the "market" are not <a
          href="/about/basics/freesoftware.html" title="What is Free
          Software?">free as in freedom</a>. They frequently work against the
          interest of the users, spy on them and sometimes can not even be
          removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This campaign can help you to <strong>regain control</strong>
          of your Android device and your data. It collects information about
          running an Android system as free as possible and tries to coordinate
          the efforts in this area.

      <h2 id="Background">Political Background</h2>
      
      <h3>Freedom and Control</h3>
      
      <p>
        Smart-phones are small computers that we carry around all the time. Most
        smart-phones are not controlled by the users, but by the manufacturer
        and the operator. The software that runs on them is not Free Software.
        Even Android phones ship with non-free software and proprietary add-ons
        that usually do not work in the full interest of the user. Software
        updates will only be made available when the manufacturer still has a
        commercial interest in your device. The applications (apps) available
        from the official market are most of the time non-free. Nobody is
        allowed to study how they work and what they really do on your phone.
        Sometimes they just don't work exactly as you want, but sometimes they
        even contain malicious features.
      </p>

      <p>
        Running only Free Software on your device puts you in full control. Even
        though you might not be able to directly exercise all of your freedom,
        you will benefit from a vibrant community that can do it together.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      
      <p>
        Our mobile devices contain more personal information than most private
        diaries. But proprietary systems, even most Android phones, are designed
        to leave this data in control of companies like Google or Apple. Most
        users do not have full control over the personal data on their device.
        Convenient solutions for cloud-based synchronization and data backup
        trick more and more people into storing all their data on centralized
        servers run by some commercial organisation. Whoever has personal
        information about us is able to manipulate us. Therefore non-free
        devices are a threat to democracy and our society. 
      </p>
      
      <p> 
        Privacy is one of the most important reasons to support Free Software.
        Proprietary add-ons like <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_IQ">Carrier IQ</a> spy on
        smart-phone users without their knowledge. Many apps from the market
        contain malicious features. They read your private data and "phone
        home", or they use <a
        href="https://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/mobile/android.html#overview">Google
        Analytics</a> to send data to Google. These are just examples that have
        been discovered so far. The lack of freedom impedes independent
        inspection and secret spy features only become known by accident.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most smart-phones require you to connect and identify yourself to a
        centralized server before you can use them properly. Users have to trust
        the server without knowing what information is stored and how it is
        processed or related to other data. A phone running only Free Software
        does not require you to provide data to an untrustworthy company or
        pressure you to do so - at least this is very unlikely, as the
        software's actions would be obvious and the community would be able to
        develop an alternative version. The convenience of "value-added"
        services that are often coupled with such connections can be provided
        using Free Software as well. This keeps you in control of your personal
        data, your diary remains in your possession. You can have the cake and
        eat it too.

        If you want to stay informed or like to work with others on a free
        Android system, you can <strong><a

        For technical questions about apps, the <a

        place to ask. For exchange about the lower layers of Android, the <a

      <h2>Other Related Initiatives</h2>

      <p>
        Even though this campaign is about Android, there are other important
        initiatives that also have the goal to allow you using small mobile
        computers in freedom. There is the spiritual Openmoko continuation <a
        href="http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-main/">GTA04 from Golden
        Delicious</a>. It builds a free phone without the need for proprietary
        drivers. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maemo">Maemo</a>/<a
        href="https://meego.com/">MeeGo</a> initiative has now moved into <a
        href="http://merproject.org/">Mer</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen">Tizen</a> and tries to be an
        alternative free operating system. Also WebOS is <a
        href="http://developer.palm.com/blog/2011/12/open-source/">about to be
        liberated</a>.
