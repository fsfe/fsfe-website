	<center><h2>FSF, APRIL, FSF France and GNU working together</h2></center>
	<p/> On May 21, 2001 <a
	href="http://france.fsfeurope.org/">FSF France</a> shipped me
	(<a href="loic@gnu.org">Loïc Dachary</a>) to Boston. I was to
	install a new set of hardware for the <a
	href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">Savannah</a> development
	tool. In the plane back to Paris I realized that this week was
	so intense that you'd probably like to share some bits of it
	with me.

	<p/> The FSF distribution office (DO) is located in Boston
	downtown, near the park. I went there straight from the
	airport to check my mail and meet with <a
	href="bkuhn@gnu.org">Bradley M. Kuhn</a>, <a
	href="lisa@gnu.org">Lisa Goldstein</a> and <a
	href="3diff@gnu.org"> Brian Youmans</a> who are working there
	to further Free Software day after day. When I entered the 50
	square meter room with my knapsack, I also had the surprise to
	discover that <a href="jcasey@gnu.org">Janet Casey</a> was
	working here.  For some reason I thought she was maintaining
	the Free Software Directory from somewhere else. After a
	cheerful greeting, I was able to connect and everybody went
	back to work.

	      Around 7pm <a href="rms@gnu.org">Richard M. Stallman</a>
	      came to pick me up with <a href="tom@gnu.org">Tom Turner</a>'s
	      car. We spent an entertaining 30 minutes to go to china town
	      and park. You have to realize that china town is 5 minutes
	      walk from the DO and you'll understand why it's customary for
	      people living in Boston to avoid using their car. That was
	      about the only time I was in a car, the subway was far more
	      convenient.  After diner we drove back to the MIT AI Lab (tech
	      square) and I was able to connect and work some more. The MIT
	      AI Lab is located in the Laboratory of Computer Science, 545
	      Tech Square. For some reason someone decided to renumber it to
	      200 Tech Square. When I asked, Bradley told me that they will
	      stop renting the building and relocate everyone in another one,
	      currently in construction across the street. One morning,
	      coming from tech square I paused in front of the sign
	      advertising the new building. On the top left it reads, yellow
	      on blue : William H. Gates. I did not even ask for more
	      information, it just gave me the creeps and I headed for the
	      DO, two subway stations away.

	      While configuring the new machine at the DO, I was
	      immersed in the day to day activities of the FSF. Brian
	      tirelessly ships and receive books, mugs and t-shirts, using
	      more space than anyone. There were intense discussions about
	      the new t-shirt based on the <a
		href="http://www.nevrax.org/">Nevrax Design Team</a> drawing
	      called the <a
		href="http://www.gnu.org/graphics/meditate.html">floating
		gnu</a>. Lisa worked for the FSF in the early days (86), she
	      came back a few weeks ago after 8 years of vacations (;-) to
	      be the Business Manager. I was most impressed by her ability to
	      write and speak Chinese fluently. Beside the fact that it's a
	      major advantage when going out in china town, that will help
	      setting up FSF China. Janet quietly works on the Free Software
	      Directory and I'm ashamed to say that I did not spare an hour
	      to talk with her about it. I guess I'll have to come back next
	      year then ;-) Bradley does the usual thing a Vice President
	      and a kernel do : switching context. Although I did not count
	      them, a wild guess would be that he handles from 30 to 100
	      contexts a day. Well, except the day he spent talking to
	      journalists about RMS's talk to counter the Craig Mundie
	      statement.

	      On Friday evening Lisa used her skills to organize a
	      diner in china town to celebrate the existence of the FSF
	      Europe.  This tribute to the FSF Europe from the FSF was
	      materialized by a Chinese cake reading <i>Thanks FSF
		Europe</i> in red letters. I was more moved that I'd be
	      willing to admit but I got over it by drinking half of the
	      <i>Veuve Cliquot</i> bottle. On behalf of the FSF Europe
	      members and friends, I extend my gratitude to all FSF members
	      and friends. Let's unite and make Free Software available to
	      all. Hips.

	<p/> Sunday night my work was over and I started to relax.  I
	asked <a href="roland@gnu.org">Roland McGrath</a> for
	diner but he moved to California some time (years ?) ago. Oh
	well. Then, at 3am, while exchanging email with <a
	href="tower@ai.mit.edu">Leonard H. Tower Jr.</a> I realized
	that he was probably a few blocks away. It was indeed the case
	and we met for lunch near tech square. He shared some of
	his souvenirs of the early days when he co-founded the Free
	Software Foundation with RMS. 

	<p/> Before leaving tech square to the airport Bradley
	introduced me to Gerry Sussman. Gerry scared the shit out of me
	by explaining that the copyright law is controlled by Disney,
	world wide. Since he is a member of the FSF board I should
	better check this to find out if he was kidding or not :-)

	<p/> I was not here to investigate legal matters, though. I
	diverted most of the subjects that popped in the conversations
	by sending email or adding tasks to Savannah. I had to focus
	on the real work: installing the new machine in the
	collocation space and migrate the content of the old machine 
	to the new. That may seem boring at first but this is counting
	without <a href="devnull@gnu.org">Joel N. Weber II</a> and <a
	href="mhw@gnu.org">Mark H. Weaver</a> who made it easy and 
	entertaining.

	      Replacing the machine used by the GNU project for <a
		href="http://subversions.gnu.org/">CVS</a> and the <a
		href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">Savannah</a> development tool
	      became necessary when RMS agreed that it should welcome all
	      Free Software projects that needed it, not just the GNU
	      packages. The PII300 with 128Mb of RAM and 5Gb of disk had to
	      be replaced. FSF France and APRIL called for donations and
	      found 40 000 FF for this purpose in two weeks time. While
	      gathering money I virtually shopped for hardware under the
	      direction of Joel who already had a precise idea of what was
	      needed. The new machine is a brand new dual PIII 800 with
	      1GB of ECC RAM and 90Gb of disk.

	<p/> As always, it was not as simple as one would expect. Joel
	has an excellent contact with Barton Bruce, Vice President of
	Global Naps, a major provider of the Boston area. Global Naps
	is already providing the T1 to the DO and extended this offer
	to host machines of the GNU project in their main collocation
	building. The new Savannah machine was the opportunity to take
	advantage of this offer but it required an ethernet switch, a UPS
	and a terminal controller in addition to the machine.

	<p/> We ended up finding all those for a total of 37 000 FF
	which is a really good deal knowing that all hardware is new
	and has all the features a system administrator need to manage
	hardware in a collocation space. Part of this low price must
	be credited to Larry Augustin who gave us a special price
	break of 20% on the VA 2230 we chose to buy. Another part comes
	from Joel who provided an old desktop to act as the terminal
	controller.

	      You see, Joel has this interesting theory that an old
	      machine that does mostly nothing is perfectly fit for the job
	      of controlling serial ports. Someone has still to prove him
	      wrong on that subject.  In addition a machine with a full
	      fledged Free Software operating system has encryption and this
	      is something no specialized terminal controller hardware cares to
	      provides. That is surprising considering that the terminal
	      controller allows you to watch the machines consoles and
	      remotely power cycle them. In most cases you can even interact
	      with the bios at boot time.

	<p/> Before this week I was not really convinced that a terminal
	control was mandatory when installing a machine at a collocation
	space. After spending a few days rebooting and crashing the machine
	installed a few miles away, I could not turn back. This is not
	only something you need for emergency situations, it's something
	you need to install or upgrade the machine. It saves a lot of 
	stress. 

	<p/> Also Bradley spared half an hour to install grub and
	teach me the basics. I'm converted. Mark was my co-worker to
	plan the actual migration once the hardware was setup. We
	agreed that we should keep it as simple as possible. Mark
	designed a migration plan based on rsync. The idea was simple:
	copy all the file systems, replace the kernel, reboot and 
	switch the DNS names. The actual migration plan takes about 
	one page and turned out to be that simple. We did a hardware
	upgrade and kept the software installation untouched.

	      On Thursday Joel drove his truck to the DO where Mark and
	      I waited a good half an hour on the pavement with the
	      equipment.  It took us another hour to drive the four miles to
	      Quincy where Global Naps have their collocation space. Barton
	      Bruce was expecting us and we went right to the fourth floor
	      with all the packets. At this point the game was to mount the
	      hardware in racks that look like aluminum ladders instead of
	      the usual file cabinets. Barton, Joel and Mark had fun trying
	      to guess the center of mass of each equipment. After a short
	      stop to the fridge, Barton granted us a tour of the building.
	      Global Naps is an open collocation space where each client is
	      invited not to mess with other people hardware unless he has
	      the desire to see his own drop of the roof.  Barton told us
	      that this is literally written down on the contracts.

	<p/> At the end of the day the machine was online and I had
	two more days to prepare for the actual switch-over. After Joel
	fixed a minor problem with the kernel of the terminal
	controller taking a good half of the 8MB of available RAM, I
	happily rebooted and tested the new machine from tech square.
	I had to recompile the kernel to increase the maximum number
	of groups per process. When booting this new kernel on the
	exact rsync'd copy of the file systems of the old machine, I
	merely had to change a few configuration files to get it
	working properly. 

	<p/> During a good 8 hours on Saturday I exercised the migration
	many times, running rsync to keep up to date with the old machine,
	rebooting, testing all the services. At the same time Joel decreased
	the TTL of the gnu.org zone to minimize the propagation delay. 
	The day before, I sent a warning to the 700 users of the machine, 
	advertising the switch-over for Sunday morning. And indeed I was
	able to switch-over as planned. Being extra careful and double
	checking every bit, the down-time was around 40 minutes. Half
	an hour later everything was routed to the new machine. 

	<p/> This was the conclusion of a successful, 100% cooperative
	project involving FSF, APRIL, FSF France and GNU. It went more
	smoothly than most similar projects I experienced. It also
	involved a lot of knowledgeable people that no company could
	afford to get to work together. As a conclusion I would just
	like to thank all of them: Barton Bruce, Karthik Arumugham,
	Joel N. Weber II, Mark H. Weaver, Bradley M. Kuhn, Richard
	M. Stallman, Brian Youmans, Philippe Gerum, Juliette Bertho,
	Larry Augustin, Didier Guyomarch, Rodolphe Quiedeville, Cyril
	Bouthors.
