      are working to build freedom in digital society. We operate in a lively

          My eleven months as trainee and part of the FSFE's international team,
          have been full with new things to learn, great people to meet,
          challenges to overcome and opportunities to grasp. There was never a
          boring day. I was involved in high-level legal and policy work as well
          as community building and awareness-raising activities. I was in the
          core preparation team of short and long-term campaigns.

          My internship at FSFE was great! The team was amazing and the work
          taught me a lot about Free Software, it opened my eyes to a lot of
          things. I enjoyed every second of my internship, I met different kinds
          of people and gained friendships that I will treasure forever.

    <li>Location: Berlin, Germany.</li>
    <li>Compensation: Interns receive a compensation corresponding to the
    currently applicable statutory minimum wage for a full-time job (~1440â‚¬ as
    of 1 January 2021. Subject to change). The specific current amount is

          With my internship at the Free Software Foundation Europe, I was given
          the opportunity to work together with amazing and highly motivated
          people. I could bring in my existing skills in a meaningful way, as
          well as learn a whole lot of new technical methods and ways to enthuse
          people. In my usual field of statistics and data analysis, Free
          Software and Open Data becomes increasingly important and is a key to
          privacy-friendly and ethical Data Science, which is why I am so
          delighted to be able to contribute to the work the FSFE is doing.

  <h2>Who we're looking for</h2>
  <p>
    FSFE interns are a pretty diverse bunch. If you are interested in
    working on the frontline of technology policy and activism, then
    you've come to the right place. You're fired up about a free
    information society, and you've already done something to tell others
    why freedom matters? Then this internship is for you. Your academic
    background and qualifications matter less than your experience, your
    will to learn, and your ability to get things done. We expect:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Solid basic knowledge of, and considerable interest in, Free
      Software (required)
    </li>
    <li>
      Fluent English (written and spoken) is a requirement;
      a working knowledge of other languages is an asset.
    </li>
    <li>
      Basic acquaintance with working on GNU/Linux systems (desirable)
    </li>
    <li>
      Ability to be creative, responsible, and to multitask.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ability to integrate into a young, motivated and professional team
    </li>
    <li>
      No programming skills required. Programming is one of the
      few things you probably <i>won't</i> be doing during your
      internship, unless you're applying for a technical
      internship.
    </li>
    <li>We want more women to be involved in Free Software. That's
      why when there are candidates with equal qualification, we will give
      preference to applications from suitably qualified female candidates.</li>
  </ul>

      <div>
        <p>
          I am passionate about Free Software and I always wanted to help with
          its promotion. That's why an offer to help the FSFE was a perfect fit
          for me. During my internship, I worked mostly on developing the FSFE's
          infrastructure and helped by adding documentation for specific tasks
          involving different services. Interns at FSFE are really useful, as
          they bring their experience and knowledge to the FSFE and, given the
          structure and openness of the organisation, are able to do meaningful
          work that has a real value.
