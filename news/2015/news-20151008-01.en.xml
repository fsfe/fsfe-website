	  <title>Revisiting the Sony Rootkit fiasco 10 years later</title>

    <body>
      
        <p>Today the Free Software Foundation Europe looks back on the Sony
          rootkit fiasco from 2005. This page outlines some facts about the
          rootkit and how it was handled, as well as some context about what
          these kinds of restrictions mean for the notion of computers as
          general purpose machines.  31 October 2015 marks the 10 year
          anniversary of when the rootkit was discovered, and in preparation
          for this day, we ask you all to use this information and spread the
          word, not only about the Sony rootkit, but about the dangers of
          digital restrictions on users' freedoms everywhere.</p>
