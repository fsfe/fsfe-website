    <h1>FSFE and the antitrust case against Microsoft</h1>

    <p class="background">
      Europe's most important antitrust action in the software field
      was the European Commission's case against Microsoft, running
      from 2004 to 2007. FSFE participated as a
      third party, providing expert input on Free Software,
      interoperability and competition. We worked closely with the
      Samba team, which develops a Free Software alternative to
      Microsoft's proprietary workgroup server. 
    </p>
    <p class="background">
      The European Commission imposed a record fine of EUR 497 million on
      Microsoft. In 2012, the European Court of Justice ruled that
      Microsoft would have to pay another EUR 860 million for failing
      to comply with the Commission's decision.
    </p>

    <h2>FSFE represented developers' interests</h2>

    <p>
		FSFE played two key roles in this case. We represented
		the interests of Free Software developers.  In our
		official role as Intervener, we persuaded the European
		Commission to reject any royalty requirements that
		would be incompatible with Free Software.  We also
		argued constantly for the publication of useful
		technical documentation and against lock-out of Free
		Software based on arbitrary manipulations of formats
		and standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        FSFE's most important achievement was to make sure that Free
      Software developers could actually use the interoperability
      information which Microsoft was forced to release to build
      competing products.
    </p>

    <h2>Incorruptible</h2>

    <p>
	FSFE was one of only two public interest organisation which
		Microsoft could not buy off. The case began with many
		companies giving testimony of Microsoft's breaches of
		antitrust regulation, but one by one these companies
		made deals with Microsoft and withdrew from the
		case. FSFE and SIIA were the only two organisations
		that pursued this case from start to finish. We were
		later joined by ECIS, who did extraordinary
		work. Without this sustained support, the Commission
		would probably not pursued the case as decisively as
		it did.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting interoperability information</h2>

    <p>
		At the heart of this case was that the European
		Commission would require Microsoft to publish
		interoperability information. This type of information
		is necessary for non-Microsoft software, such as Samba
		running on GNU/Linux, to communicate and function
		fully within existing client-server Microsoft
		networks. <i>The interoperability information was not
		secret because it was valuable. It was valuable only
		because it was secret.</i>
    </p>

    <h2>Ruling confirmed at all levels</h2>

    <p>
		Supported by the persistent work by Carlo Piana,
		Andrew Tridgell, Jeremy Allison, Volker Lendecke,
		Georg Greve and other people acting on FSFE and
		Samba's behalf, the Commission's decision that
		Microsoft had breached competition rules was upheld at
		the highest level.
    </p>

    <h2>Interoperable applications now possible</h2>

    <p>
		Information has now been published and is being used
		by the developers of Samba and many other projects to
		improve network interoperability for Free Software
		applications.  This facilitates migration to Free
		Software. The court rulings have also set important
		precedents as to what business practices are
		considered acceptable.
