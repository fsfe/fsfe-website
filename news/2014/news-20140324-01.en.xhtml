    Computers in the post-Snowden era: choose before paying!
  </h1> 

  <p>The revelations from Edward Snowden concerning massive
  surveillance of communications demonstrates the need for each person to be
  able to control their computers and phones. Yet computer and telephone
  manufacturers and retailers typically impose on users programs that jeopardise
  their privacy.</p>

  <p>Each person should therefore have the opportunity to refuse to pay for
  non-Free software, and be allowed to choose the programs that run on their
  telephone and computer.</p>

  <p>Today, the Free Software Foundation Europe joins <a
    href="http://no.more.racketware.info/petition/support">other organisations
  throughout the world</a> in requesting an unfettered choice of the operating
  system on telephones, laptops and other computing devices.</p>

  <p><strong>Update:</strong> It is currently impossible to sign the petition without using non-free software javascript, the Racketware Team is now aware of the issue.</p>
