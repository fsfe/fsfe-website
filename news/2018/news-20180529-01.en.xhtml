  <h2 id="aboutthefsfe">About the FSFE</h2>

	<p>Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to control technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives; and it is important that this technology empowers rather than restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt, and share software. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press, and privacy.</p>

	<p>The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination. It enhances users' rights by abolishing barriers to Free Software adoption, encourages people to use and develop Free Software, and provides resources to enable everyone to further promote Free Software in Europe.</p>

	<p>Our main policy topics cover Free Software and Open Standards issues on the EU and member state level. Currently the main focus is on <a href="https://publiccode.eu">"Public Money Public Code"</a> campaign, <a href="http://savecodeshare.eu/">"Save Code Share"</a>, <a href="/activities/radiodirective/">"EU Radio Lockdown directive"</a> </p>
