<h1>Technical Note: Mail Issues on June 8</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">On Friday morning, one of our servers had a fatal hardware crash. This 
affected parts of our mail infrastructure and mailing lists. Meanwhile, 
all services are back to normal. We would like inform you about what 
happened and which problems it caused.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to the downtime, some mails sent during this time 
to some of our <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/">mailing lists</a> may 
have been lost while most have just been delayed. Please make sure that 
your mails sent on 8 and 9 June arrived their destination by checking 
the archives, and resend them if necessary. If you still experience 
problems, please <a href="/contact/">get in touch with us</a>.</p>

<p>Background: The said server lost one of its hardware components for 
which we weren't able to get a replacement at short notice. This forced 
us to migrate the setup and data to a new host. We have been able to 
bring the most critical service back to life within the course of the 
day, others were reestablished during the weekend.</p>

<p>Please excuse the inconveniences this caused. We will work hard to 
prevent such a long downtime of a critical service in the future. If 
you would like to support our technical team, please don't hesitate to 
reach out to our <a

Hackers</a>.</p>
