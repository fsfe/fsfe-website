      <h3>Does flashing your device (e.g. an Android phone) and replacing its operating system void your statutory warranty, if you are a consumer located in the European Union?</h3>
      <p>
		<strong>In general terms, no.</strong> The statutory warranty 
		does not become void by replacing the OS on an Android phone. 
		Just the fact that you modified or changed the software of your 
		device is not a sufficient reason to void your statutory 
		warranty. Vendors should provide a warranty for a period of 2 
		years, as long as you have bought the device as a consumer in 
		the European Union<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
		The Sale of Goods Directive (EU) 2019/771, maintains the <a 
		href="/activities/android/flashingdevices.html">position 
		the FSFE reported in 2012</a> <a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a>. 
		In case your Android device stops working in 2 years, even with 
		the OS installed by you, the seller has to fix or replace it. 
		The new law applies to any goods with digital content. Android 
		devices (e.g. smartphones and smartwatches) are examples of 
		such goods.
      </p>
      
      <p>
		In case the vendor refuses to provide a warranty and you need 
		to go to court, the law protects you by imposing on the vendor 
		the duty to prove that you had caused the defect. If your 
		device becomes defective in the first year of use, it is 
		presumed that the defect was there before the purchase <a 
		class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a>. However, if your device becomes 
		defective after the first year, but before 2 years run out, you 
		are still covered by the warranty. The difference is only that 
		if the defect arises after the first year, the vendor can claim 
		that the defect was caused by some action that was triggered by 
		non-normal use of the device. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
		Unless the seller can prove that modifying the software, 
		flashing your device with some other OS or firmware was the 
		cause for the defect, you are still covered by the warranty. A 
		good test to see if it is the software's fault is to flash it 
		back with stock firmware/OS and see if the problem persists. If 
		it does, it is not a software-caused problem. If it is not 
		possible to revert it to stock software any more, it is also 
		not a software-caused defect.
      </p>
      
      <p>
		Many manufacturers of consumer devices write into their 
		warranties a paragraph that by changing the software or 
		flashing your device, you void the warranty. This refers to a 
		“voluntary warranty”, one which the seller or 
		manufacturer can, but does not need to, offer as an additional 
		service to the consumer. This is unrelated to the statutory 
		warranty (also called commercial guarantee by law)<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a>. 
		Nevertheless, if the manufacturer or anyone 
		else offers a voluntary warranty through the vendor, they should be bound to it as 
		well.
      </p>
      
      <p>
		Regarding driver updates, device vendors must keep the 
		consumer informed of and supplied with updates, including 
		security updates, that are necessary to keep devices in 
		conformity during the warranty period, even if a different OS 
		is installed. The Digital Content Directive (EU) 2019/770<a 
		class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> imposes the duty on the vendor to 
		provide such updates, unless the trader proves that the 
		consumer's digital environment<a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a> 
		is not compatible with the technical requirements of the 
		updates. The vendor should, however, inform the consumer about 
		such requirements in a clear and comprehensible manner before 
		the conclusion of the contract.
      </p>
      
      <p>
		These provisions do not apply to second-hand devices. However, 
		in case the vendor agrees to a shorter liability or limitation 
		period, she/he must be bound to it as well.
      </p>
      
      <p>
		In case the vendor refuses your right to repair or replace the 
		device, you can sue her/him in a civil litigation and report 
		the incident to the national consumer protection authority. 
		Consumer associations also can help inform you if there is an 
		need for hiring a lawyer for this kind of process in your 
		country.
