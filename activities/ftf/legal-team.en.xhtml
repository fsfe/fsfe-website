		<h1>The Legal Team of the FSFE</h1>
		
		<p>The Legal Team of the FSFE is a group of volunteers with legal expertise that helps the FSFE with its <a href="/activities/ftf/activities.html">legal activities</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The most crucial role of FSFE’s Legal Team is to provide advice and opinions over legal policy aspects and to manage our <a href="/activities/ftf/fla.html">Fiduciary Licence Agreement</a>. Most of the Legal Team members are also part of our <a href="/activities/ftf/licence-questions.html">licence questions list</a> and of the <a href="/activities/ftf/ln.html">Legal Network</a> contributing to spreading knowledge on the legal aspects of Free Software through those channels.</p>
		
		<p id="ln-role">Furthermore, the FSFE’s Legal Team is charged with managing the <a href="/activities/ftf/ln.html">Legal Network</a>, specifically:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>organising the <a href="/activities/ftf/legal-conference.html">Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop</a></li>
			
			<li>accepting <a href="/activities/ftf/ln-rules.html#join">new members</a></li>
			
			<li>acting upon breaches of the Legal Network <a href="/activities/ftf/ln-rules.html#breaches">regulations</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Contacts</h2>
