      <h1>FSFE’s evaluation of the EU Parliament copyright report</h1>
		
		<p newsteaser="yes">On July 6th, the European Parliament voted
		on a report with a number of recommendations for copyright reform.
		We present today <a href="/activities/policy/eu/20150918-Assessment-Of-The-Report-On-InfoSoc.en.html">our
		evaluation</a> of how this could impact Free Software.</p>

		<p>A first draft of the report was written by MEP Julia Reda
		(Pirate Party) and consisted of a number of very sensible proposals
		to adapt copyright law to the challenges of today. At the time we
		<a href="/activities/policy/eu/20150605-Comments-On-Reda-Report.html">
		contacted</a> the Members of the European Parliament to highlight
		the best features and suggest some improvements.</p>
		
		<p>After going through a considerable amount of opposition and
		amendments, the European Parliament approved the final version
		of this document. Even if the report proposes some improvements
		to the current legislative framework, it presents various setbacks
		from the original draft and does not manage to completely solve
		the major problems with the current copyright legislation. In
		particular:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>the long overdue reform of copyright exceptions and 
			limitations is now limited to private copying</li>
			<li>Digital Restriction Management (DRM) can still
			unjustly keep exceptions from operating</li>
			<li>publicly funded works are not contributed to the
			public domain, nor published under free licences</li>
		</ul>
