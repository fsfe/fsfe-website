Resorting <svn>/branches/test/order/ for to

- moving outdated material/data out of the way ... prepared for deleting

- consistency in paths, filenames, article tags ... done

These are just some notes to make life easier for web@ and
translators@, hopefully.

New directory tree

Everything is now in /order/articles/
to distinguish to other $things like /promotion/.

All data and images, incl. all existing translations, where
merged into appropiate files/directories in
/order/articles/[images/[thumbnails]]

In /order/articles/images/[thumbnails/]
all images are stored and named consistently.

At /articles/, there ist just one item.en.xml and just
one info.<language>.xml for each language. 

The articles are sorted roughly as they are displayed at
fsfe.org/order 
There is no technical reason for that, it just should ease
editing.

All directories /order/<year>/ can be deleted after having
moved articles/ into live stage.

All outdated data and images are saved at an archive at
DUS office, outside svn, for there is no need for a version
control.

Questions to web@: 

- How to proceed on? First asking translators@ to take care
of the few changes, then moving to production branch, ot the
other way round?

... Gollo said: In this special case: Translating in test branch,
then moving.

TODO Rainer:

explain details about "bio" and "fair trade" standards/labels
on an different page, to be linked at the appropiate articles.

TODO $whoever:

include in the xslt magic the possibility to set remarks at articles,
preferable differenciated even for each size:

- "out of stock, deliverable at $date again"
- "out of stock, won't be produced again"
- "remaining stock, won't be produced again"

same for to display "Bio"/"Fair Trade" Labels with links.

TODO translators:
  
- As most data could be transferred smoothly, in most cases a
rough check should be sufficient.
- .nb and .fr versions are just rudimental yet
- in other versions some articles are missing
- please remove "second edition" at tshirt-hacking-black
- text on back side of girlie-hacking-black has changed
- add new articles
