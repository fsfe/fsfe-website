<p>
      As a non-profit, non-governmental organisation, Free Software 
      Foundation Europe works to create general understanding and 
      support for Free Software and Open Standards in politics, 
      business, law and society at large.

    <ul id="priorities" class="overview">
      <li>
        <h3><a href="/projects/ftf/ftf.html">Freedom Task Force</a></h3>  
        <p>
	  The Freedom Task Force collects and shares knowledge about
	  legal and licensing aspects of Free Software, safeguards the
	  interests of Free Software projects, connects experts
	  throughout the world and helps other groups achieve similar
	  goals. We provide
	  assistance, <a href="/projects/ftf/education.html">training</a>
	  and <a href="/projects/ftf/documentation.html">documentation</a>,
	  in partnership with gpl-violations.org and members of the
	  European Legal Network.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="/projects/ftf/network.html">The European Legal Network</a></h3>
        <p>
          We maintain the world's largest private, non-partisan,
          vendor-neutral network of legal experts in the field of Free
          Software licensing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="/projects/os/os.html">Open Standards</a></h3>
        <p>
	  <a href="/projects/os/def.html">Open Standards</a> allow
          people to share all kinds of data freely and with perfect
          fidelity. They prevent lock-in and other artificial barriers
          to interoperability, and promote choice between vendors and
          technology
          solutions. FSFE's <a href="/projects/os/os.en.html">work on
          Open Standards</a> has the goal of making sure that people
          find it easy to migrate to Free Software or between Free
          Software solutions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="/projects/un/un.html">United Nations</a></h3>
        <p>
	  FSFE has been active at the United Nations level since
	  2002. We have contributed to having <a
	  href="/projects/mankind/mankind.html">Free Software
	  recognised as a world heritage at UNESCO</a>. We are
	  currently active in the following areas:
	</p>
        
        <ul>
	        <li><a href="/projects/wipo/wipo.html">World Intellectual Property Organization</a></li>
	        <li><a href="/projects/igf/igf.html">Internet Governance Forum</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="overview">
      <li>
        <h3><a href="/projects/eu/eu.html">European Union</a></h3>
        <p>
	  FSFE works with the <a href="/projects/eu/eu.html">European
	  Commission and European Parliament</a> to create a positive
	  environment for Free Software and Open Standards in
	  Europe. We fight against monopolies and for competition in
	  the software market by participating as an interested third
	  party
	  in <a href="/projects/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.html">antitrust</a>
	  cases. We inform policy makers about the opportunities that
	  Free Software offers, and push for interoperability.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="/about/team.html">Public Awareness</a></h3>
        <p>
	  Informing the public about Free Software is part of FSFE's
	  core mission. Many people in the organisation are experts on
	  various Free Software topics, and can be contacted about
	  giving authoritative talks, holding workshops, or
	  participating in discussions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="/projects/education/education.html">Education</a></h3>
        <p>
          FSFE actively promote the use of Free Software in schools and
          universities. Free Software is pedagogically superior, its
          basic spirit involving freedom and cooperation is the same
          spirit of education in a democratic environment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="/projects/swpat/swpat.html">Software patents in Europe</a></h3>
        <p>
	  Software patents are a menace to society and economy. They
	  restrict innovation, damage businesses and put collaborative
	  creativity in great danger. FSFE fights to keep Europe free
	  of software patents, and works at the UN level to abolish
	  software patents around the world.
        </p>
