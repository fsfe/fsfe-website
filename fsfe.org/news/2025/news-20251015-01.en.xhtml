<h1>DMA litigation against Apple: a quick recap</h1>

<p>
The Digital Markets Act aimed to open Europe’s digital ecosystems, but 
that promise is now being tested. In Apple v. European Commission, Apple 
challenges key DMA rules on interoperability and user choice at the EU's 
highest court. The FSFE is intervening to defend user freedoms. The 
public hearing takes place Tuesday, 21 October.</p>

<h3>Interoperability for the public interest</h3>

<p>At the heart of the <a href="/activities/dma/dma">Digital Markets Act 
(DMA)</a> there are measures that require gatekeepers to avoid practices 
that lock users and developers into closed ecosystems. For example, 
rules that enable users to uninstall pre-installed apps, to install and 
use third-party app stores and apps (side-loading), and to obtain access 
to hardware and software features needed for third-party software to 
work. Those interoperability and access obligations are not abstract: 
they are the technical and legal levers that allow Free Software 
programs to be installed, updated, and integrated on mobile devices, and 
to compete with gatekeepers’ services. Without effective 
interoperability, Free Software is blocked from reaching users, 
developers face technically imposed barriers, and everyone loses the market advantages of a levelled playing field as foreseen by the DMA.
</p>

<p>
That is why, when Apple decided to fight some of these rules in court, 
we at the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) decided to step in as a 
civil-society intervener in <a 
href="/activities/apple-litigation/apple-litigation.html">T-1080/23, 
Apple v. European Commission</a>. In this case in front of the European 
Union Court of Justice, Apple challenges obligations imposed by the DMA. 
Apple was designated as a DMA “gatekeeper” in September 2023 and began 
litigation soon afterwards; the FSFE requested to intervene in February 
2024, the Court allowed the intervention, and the FSFE has submitted <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/device-neutrality/fsfe-Intervention-apple-vs-commission-Sep-24-redacted.pdf">written 
arguments</a> ahead of the <a 
href="/news/2025/news-20250922-01.html">public hearing scheduled in 
Luxembourg on 21 October</a>. The FSFE is represented in court by the 
lawyer Dr. Martin Husovec and is bringing the civil-society perspective 
to ensure that the court sees the wider implications for developers and 
users.
</p>

<p>
Apple argues that the DMA infringes on its fundamental rights, claiming 
that the interoperability obligations are “expropriating” the company’s 
“intellectual-property rights”. We disagree. In our <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/device-neutrality/fsfe-Intervention-apple-vs-commission-Sep-24-redacted.pdf">intervention</a>, 
we emphasize that Apple’s obligations under the DMA are not arbitrary 
restrictions but regulations adopted in the public interest: to 
safeguard competition, innovation, and consumer choice. The DMA’s 
purpose is to prevent gatekeepers from unilaterally controlling access 
to digital ecosystems that have become essential infrastructures. 
Ensuring interoperability and user freedom is a legitimate and 
proportionate way to serve those goals

<blockquote>
“Standing against a corporate giant like Apple, which has billions of 
euros to hinder Software Freedom, reflects the FSFE's commitment to 
preserving open and competitive digital environments. The FSFE's 
intervention is fundamental for Device Neutrality, ensuring that users 
and developers are not locked into proprietary systems and can freely 
choose and use the software they want.”<cite>states Lucas Lasota, FSFE 
Legal Programme
Manager.</cite>

<h3> Why this case matters – and how you can help </h3>
<p>
How the Court interprets and enforces the DMA in this case will shape 
whether those interoperability rights are real and usable in practice. 
It will affect whether Free Software can be an accessible, competitive 
alternative on billions of devices, or remain constrained by proprietary 
lock-in. The FSFE is the only civil-society organisation intervening to 
defend software freedom in these proceedings, but strategic litigation 
is resource-intensive: preparing submissions, expert work, and travel to 
Luxembourg for the hearing all require funding. If you value device 
neutrality, interoperability and the ability of Free Software to 
flourish, please consider supporting our intervention! Your donation 
directly helps us appear in court and keep defending user and developer 
rights!
