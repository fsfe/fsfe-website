<p id="introduction">Valentine's Day traditionally is a day to show and celebrate love with your beloved one. That is why Valentine's Day seems to be a great opportunity to show your love for <a href="/about/basics/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>, too, as well as to the initiatives and organisations behind it.<br/>
	According to last years success, we decided to keep this campaign running on an annual basis. Hence, this page is about the "I love Free Software"-Day 2012. If you like to know more about last years campaign, please have a look at the <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/maelle/?p=228">report of Valentine's Day 2011</a>.

<h2>#ilovefs day 2012</h2>
<p>As every year, Valentine's Day will be celebrated on the 14th of February, which will be a Tuesday this year. Similar to last year, the FSFE is planning an online campaign to celebrate this day as an "I love Free Software" - Day. Additionally, there will be an <a href="./unperfekthaus.en.html">"I love Free Software" - event this year in the Unperfekthaus in Essen</a>.</p>

<h2>Campaign: Spread your love for Free Software</h2> 
<p>Our online campaign aims at rising awareness to Free Software and the people behind it. Because behind every Free Software initiative and organisation are real, passionate
hard-working people. Show them that you appreciate their work – it could make
all the difference!<br/>
Of course, there are lots of ways to declare one's love... Here are just some ideas about how you can go public and proclaim your love to Free Software.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Send active Free Software supporters a message thanking them for their work. Do not underestimate the effects of such a message. As many Free Software developers work hard for their projects without earning money, a big "thank you" / "love you" is a good currency for their further encouragement </li>
  <li>Especially on Valentine's Day, microblog about how you love Free Software, and use the Hashtag <!-- [dont't translate the comment] link either to http://identi.ca/ilovefs or to the agregation of dents underneath--> <strong><a href="http://identi.ca/ilovefs">#ilovefs</a></strong>. </li> Encourage your friends to do as well, so we can try to get a high ranking on Twitter trends and hashtag timelines in identi.ca and other blogging system.
  <li>If you are a Blogger, blog about the "I love Free Software" - Day and the idea behind it. Get people attracted by the idea of Free Software.</li>
  <li>We set up a <a href="./banners.en.html">page showing different banners</a> that support the "I love Free Software" - Day and that are free to use. Some even come along with code snippets to easily implement it on your homepage or blog.</li>
  <li>If you are living in Germany, please promote <a href="./unperfekthaus.en.html">our event in the Unperfekt-Haus in Essen</a></li>
</ul>

<!-- <h2><span><a name="testimonials">Why they love Free Software</a></span></h2>

<p>"On Valentines Day, the Society for Free Culture and Software, extends their
love to projects such as Audacity, GIMP, Inkscape and other audiovisual tools.
These tools form the backbone of the infrastructure needed to support free
culture and while Free Culture could technically exist independently of Free
Software, the two movements share a common philosophy of freedom which make the
two inseparable.  Without Free Software, our activities would be so much more
difficult to carry out, and no Free Culture project would be able to enjoy the
full freedoms without the infrastructure created by Free Software projects such
as those outlined before. To everyone engaged in supporting this
infrastructure: thank you! We love you!"<br/>

<p>Free Software is central to everything KDE does and without Free Software KDE  
software could not exist.<br/>

KDE relies overwhelmingly on volunteer contributions from people all around 
the world who, initially, do not know one another. Free Software provides the 
social contract that makes such contributions possible, as our volunteers know 
they are helping to create a common good that can be shared by all.<br/>

Free Software and the shared purpose it creates also gives KDE its distinctive  
non-hierarchical meritocratic structure. Without the principles of Free 
Software, KDE would need centralised control of the software copyrights and, 
in turn, a set of leaders determining the direction of the software we 
produce. Our contributors would have less ability to try out new ideas, to 
work on the things that really matter to them and, above all, to be Free.<br/>

Without Free Software, there would be no KDE. Free Software gives KDE life. 
KDE loves Free Software.<br/>
— <strong>Cornelius Schumacher, <a href="http://ev.kde.org">President of KDE e.V.</a></strong> </p>

<p>"A few decades ago the word "Freedom" had a very different meaning than
today. We live in a digital society in which many aspects of our lives,
and of our Freedom, go through a digital medium. Having full control of
the software we use is therefore the only way to achieve full control of
our Freedom. I love Free Software because I take care of my Freedom."<br/>
