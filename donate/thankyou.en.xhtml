    <h2>What's next?</h2>

    <p>
      Unless you checked the "I want to remain anonymous" option, we will add
      your name to our <a href="thankgnus.html">donors list</a>. We generally
      use the name of the account holder or card holder for this; if you want
      to be listed with a different name, please
      <a href="mailto:contact@fsfe.org">contact us</a>.
      In any case, please note that it can take a few days until your name is
      added.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, you can include our
      <a href="/about/graphics/sponsoring/sponsoring.en.html">Sponsoring buttons</a>
      on your own web page to show your support for us.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some countries, donations to us can be deducted from income tax.
      Currently, this is the case in <a href="germany.html">Germany</a> and
      <a href="switzerland.html">Switzerland</a>. If you need a donation
      receipt, please 
      <a href="mailto:contact@fsfe.org">get in contact with our office</a>.
