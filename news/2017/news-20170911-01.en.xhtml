  <h1>FSFE in 2020</h1>
  <h2>Reaffirming our identity</h2>

<p newsteaser="yes">
Our world is constantly changing, as are people's thoughts and perceptions. Since its founding in 2001, individuals engaged in the FSFE, from coordinators and volunteers to full-time employees, have come to develop their understanding of what FSFE is and what our shared values are. Sometimes the views expressed by individuals have been similar to one another, sometimes they have diverged.
</p>
<p>
A strategy review in 2014 identified at least seven different ways that people give on describing and communicating FSFE. This phenomenon is a result of the process of change and is all fine; expected even, as an organisation grows and develops over time. Moving forward, we see a need for us to come together under a common identity; a shared understanding of what FSFE is, what’s important in our work, what values we have and share, and how this shapes FSFE of the future.

<p>
This is one of the first logotypes for the FSFE, used from 2001 to 2006. 
We have come a long way since then, and it's time to reaffirm the identity
the organisation has grown into.

<p>
With the <i>FSFE in 2020 project</i>, we are looking to redefine and renew the identity of FSFE, a process similar to one we undertook when founding the organisation. Now, 15 years later, we will be able to reflect on our work over the years and come to an understanding of what aspects of our identity has remained genuine and guided the organisation through these 15 years.
</p>
<p>
In our work, we have a steering group consisting of our executive director (Jonas Öberg), two representatives from our supporters (Mirko Boehm, Daniel Pocock), two of our members (Alessandro Rubini and Cryptie) and one member of staff (Erik Albers). Together with Kristi Progri as the project assistant in this work, they will try to steer us right on our path towards rediscovering FSFEs organisational identity.
</p>
<p>
Our primary focus will be on taking interviews from volunteers, coordinators, employees and others who feel that they have a connection with FSFE. We will also talk to people outside of the FSFE who have come in contact with our work and will be able to reflect not only on how we perceive the FSFE inside of it, but how we’ve managed to convey our identity to the public over the years.
</p>
<p>
As we work on this for the next few months, there will be several opportunities for all parts of our community to be heard: we will ask individuals to participate in interviews, sometimes directly, sometimes by asking for people who are interested in participating. We’ll conduct surveys circulated through our community and newsletter, and we will share our findings regularly, on our web pages, and on our <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/FSFE-in-2020">team wiki</a>.
</p>
<p>
We’re starting on an exciting adventure, and we hope you will join us on our way forward!
