        <title>FSFE Women* Group Meeting (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>FSFE Women is a group for women* who are interested in Free Software. We get together about once in a month online to meet, give talks about topics we find interesting in the area of Free Software and discuss recent developments. The group is women-centric and open to all women, inter, trans and non-binary people.</p>
      <p>The meeting is in English. We start at 8:00 pm CEST and usually stay together for ~ 2 hours.</p>
