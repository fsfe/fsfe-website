      <p>On Saturday, 18th September at 14:00 pm (CEST), Bonnie Mehring, FSFE's junior project manager, will present &quot;Public Money? Public Code!: A campaign framework to promote software freedom&quot; at the Kieler Open Source and Linux Days. The campaign framework of &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; enables people all over Europe to promote software freedom in their local public administration. More than 200 organisations, and more than 31,000 individuals demand that publicly financed software should be made publicly available under Free Software licenses. Together we contacted politicians, decision makers, and civil servants on all levels -- from the European Union and national governments, to city mayors and the heads of public libraries about this demand. This did not just lead to important discussions about software freedom with decision makers, but also already to specific policy changes. Already, we have administrations from Spain, Sweden and Germany supporting &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot;. In the talk, Bonnie Mehring will explain how the campaign framework can be used to push for the adoption of Free Software friendly policies in your area; be it your public administration, your library, your university, your city, your region, or your country.  The event is free of charge and everybody is welcome to join.</p>
