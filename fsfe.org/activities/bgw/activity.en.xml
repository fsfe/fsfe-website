    <description>
      The Brave GNU World was a monthly column published from 1999 to 2004, 
      addressed at both technical and non-technical readers. Its aim was to
      provide an insight into current projects and developments based on the 
      Free Software philosophy. The Brave GNU World was translated into 9 
      languages, making it probably the most widely distributed monthly column 
      in the world.
