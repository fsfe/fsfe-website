    <h2>Why software patents are bad</h2>

    <p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is actively working against the introduction of
      software patents in Europe. Claims to innovation and competition made by software
      patent advocates lack any scientific or empirical backing. In reality, software patents
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>establish <b>monopolies on abstract ideas</b>.</li>
      <li><b>prevent innovation</b> by allowing grants without implementation (Source Code) and thereby preventing such research.</li>
      <li><b>prevent competitive markets</b> by giving large players absolute control over the marketspace.</li>
      <li><b>prevent disclosure</b> of ideas, the original motivation for the introduction of patents.</li>
      <li><b>reduce European competitiveness</b>.</li>
      <li><b>prevent interoperability</b>, increasing your dependance on a single vendor.</li>
      <li>transversally spread their <b>negative effects in all areas of economy</b>.</li>
    </ul> 

    <p>Please note that Patents on software should not be confused with
      Copyright on software. While Copyright is granted on the implementation,
      the actual program, Patents are granted on ideas that could be
      implemented in software. So when thinking of Patents, think of "symphony
      for a certain set of instruments" and not "Beethoven's 2nd."</p>
