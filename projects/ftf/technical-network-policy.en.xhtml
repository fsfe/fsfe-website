      <li>
        Any technical representative accepted by FSFE as a named contact for the
        FTF technical network may contribute financially to the FTF, but such a
        contribution is not obligatory nor will the lack of such a contribution
        result in removal from listing. Any such contribution is understood to
        be towards the maintainability of the FTF network.
      </li>

      <li>
        Any technical representative accepted by FSFE as a named contact for the
        FTF technical network can be removed from the network if the bond of trust
        is broken between the FSFE and the named contact for any reason, or due
        to restructuring or replacement of the network, after a decision by the
        majority of the General Assembly of the FSFE.
