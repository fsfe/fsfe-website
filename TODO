TODO items for www.fsfeurope.org web pages (unsorted):

* Have the "Fellowship" link from the FSFE
  front page link to the language-specific Fellowship page, similar to what is
  used for every "normal" FSFE page link. That is,
  http://fellowship.fsfe.org/index.fi.html instead of http://fellowship.fsfe.org/
  when using http://fsfe.org/index.fi.html.

* Have a list of volunteers on /contribute/web, /contribute/translators, and
  /contribute/booth to give better credit to permanent volunteers. Should be
  done with name lists which are stored in a language indepenedent file and
  included dynamically with <dynamic-content>. At the same time, remove
  volunteers from /about/team to avoid confusion.

* Change all .xsl scripts to use <dynamic-content> instead of just appending
  the dynamic content to the end of the body.

* Make sure all non-dynamic *.xhtml files have a proper <timestamp> tag.

* Validate all HTML pages with validator.w3.org (is this scriptable?)

* Make sure all documents are linked from /documents/documents whenever this
  makes sense.

* Include a dynamic document list on the project pages using <dynamic-content>.
  This will make it easier to add a new document related to a project.

* Include a dynamic news and events list on the project pages for those
  projects where it makes sense.

* Include a dynamic leaflet list on the project pages for those projects that
  have leaflets.

* Check all pages for outdated content and update them to be current. This is
  certainly one for a rainy Sunday afternoon :-)

* Clean up .symlinks (actually they should be replaced by .htaccess redirects)

* Move files from /documents that actually belong to a project to their
  respective /projects/* directory (for example wiwo). Or into other
  directories like /about/, ... Don't forget to add a redirect to not break old
  external links!

* Search the whole tree for broken links, external as well as internal (is this
  scriptable?)

* Create "braglist" (list of projects and documents) on personal pages (like
  /about/greve) dynamically from document and project .xml files. Requires
  adding an "author=" to documents and a "coordinator=" to projects.

* Scan the apache log for 404 errors resulting from external links and help
  avoid them by adding page redirects.

* Make a separate page per year for news and events.

* Find some smart solution for page groups that have a kind of local menu in
  [...] at the top of each page (like projects/swpat/* or projects/ftf/*)

* Find a better alternative for the focus system. Maybe just create different
  versions of these pages that are sensitive to focus (actually only news,
  events, projects, and documents lists)

* in internal/er.en.xhtml, allow for manual entry of name and email address
  additionally to the possibility to select from the dropdown.

* in internal/er.en.xhtml, allow for presetting of fields through URL, like
  http://www.fsfeurope.org/internal/er?budget=GENERAL

* Add id to RSS so caching readers replace old versions of a news entry or
  event with the new version istead of just adding the new version. The id
  should be the same for all languages, so changing from untranslated to
  translated shouldn't change the id.

* Create a table of content if there are more then 4 headlines on one page
  (like mediawiki does in its defaults)

* Create a "quick links" page with interesting internal and external links.

* Change the names on http://www.fsfe.org/contact/local.en.html from plain text
  to links like on http://www.fsfe.org/about/team.en.html?

* Press review page with web frontend to enter things.

* ONLY IF EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE: think about new TODO items ;-)
