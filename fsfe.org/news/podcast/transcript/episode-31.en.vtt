00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Before we start after the podcast, we would like to say thank you to all of you who support the FSF East Work of Money.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Working for software freedom and producing podcasts costs money.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Please consider supporting us with the nation on the FSFE.org slash donate and in the show notes.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Bringing these people together also takes time.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It needs energy, finding, coming, crown.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
See where we can work together.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This needs a lot of time.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Resources and yeah, if you donate to us, you make this work possible.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You make our fights for funding possible.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And then also one day we benefit you.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If you, for example, develop and maybe we get funds for your project in the future.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Hello and welcome to the software freedom podcast.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We are a charity that empowered users to take control of technology.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm body married and today I'm here with Alexander Sander.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Alex is the senior policy consultant for the FSFE.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And in his work for the FSFE, he monitors the current happenings in the European Union

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and also pushes for the recognition of the software.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Yeah, today in this policy and EU episode, I don't know.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I find this is a tongue breaker, trying to understand.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
They are called tanked.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So you know what I mean?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Alex and I will talk about our host and experience.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And especially the outcome of the two DevRooms that were on the FSFE.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Alex, thank you so much for making the time.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Thank you so much for being here on our second try for the recording.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Yeah, thanks for having me.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Okay, so how was the two DevRooms?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I remember they were not only run by the FSFE.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
There were others involved as well.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So in the EU and policy DevRooms, who was involved again?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So we partnering on two DevRooms, the legal and policy DevRooms that we are

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
organizing together with other organizations like the Software Freedom Conservancy,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Red Hat, Tom Marble, something we started to work on together doing the corona crisis,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the DevRooms itself is longer than a decade.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And it's very well established, DevRooms where we talk about SNS, legal and policy,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
related issues.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And this year, we obviously again talked a lot about the cyber resilience act,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
a topic that keeps the first them or one could say the broader Free Software community,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
discussing for pretty much two years, I think we started to discuss during the first

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
them, the cyber resilience act.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And since we are now facing the implementation, some very practical questions arise.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Which is important for us in particular for the FSFE.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
There is a so-called Stewart role introduced in the cyber resilience act,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
so there are manufacturers, Stewart and the basically one could say individual developers,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
these three roles are somehow given.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And there are exemptions in particular for people that don't earn money with free software

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
or smaller projects, projects that are non-profit projects,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and here we discuss which role they might have in the cyber resilience act

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and what application might arise for them.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And how we can, in particular, support stewards in the relationship as manufacturers,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
so that in particular, non-profit work is not destroyed by the cyber resilience act,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
but in more important, maybe even supported.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And that was a huge discussion we had together with Michael from the German BSI,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
so the Bundesant for Sicherheit in the information station,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
so basically the IT security agency for Germany,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
which also most likely be the market surveillance authority.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
For the cyber resilience act was there with me together on a session where we hosted,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
yeah, basically a Q&amp;A session on this Stewart question,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and I think that was very useful and intense discussion we had,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
so we tried to address these issues,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
but also listen to the community what they see, what their fears are,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and this ultimately will also end in a project that we run together with this German BSI,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
this IT security agency,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
where we precisely want to research on this question,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
how the relationship between stewards and manufacturers will be,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
so this first session could be also seen as a starting point to this research,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and I would also like to use this postcard episode to,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to kind of as a call, so basically if you are a Stewart,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
or if you believe you might be a Stewart,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
a few, three to reach out to me directly or to contact at FFE.org,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and we are working on a questionary which we want to share with manufacturers,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
stewards and interested stakeholders,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and in order to come up with this question there where we want to address those questions,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
we are looking for input, so if you should have some,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
it's recommended to you to watch the Q&amp;A session on this year,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
from the first term,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and maybe reach out to us if you have some input in this direction for us.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
How was the Q&amp;A session, like how many people were there,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and how, what was your feeling from the questions that,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
where are those, that are those Q&amp;A session?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Because we are just a cyber-resilience act,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I believe this is the act that we discussed the most in the previous,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
in the past year.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Yeah, it's definitely a huge discussion on going,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and that's basically good, but bad at the same time.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It's good since a lot of people take care of this very important topic.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000
The bad part is that there are some rumors and myths around the cyber-resilience act.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
One of our tasks is to explain what's really in, what's not in.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
However, there are still, as I said, many open questions

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
when it comes to implementation,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
basically the needy-credi of transforming the sentences we have in the law,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
into something which is working,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and I think it is important for the community to know

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
that there will be basically, in the end,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
a market surveillance authority who is doing this,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and it's a good idea to talk to precisely this body,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and since they really can't have this rules on how they do it,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
how they see all of this, how they implemented,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
so I think it's important to learn that,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
basically, it's the market surveillance authority who says,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
this is a steward, and this steward now needs to fulfill these obligations.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
So that's why it's a good idea to talk to them,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to listen what they have in mind,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and maybe to advocate if it's going in a wrong direction.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So that was basically, I think, a very important point

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
we made during this discussion,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and which helped the people, however,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
so when it comes to the room,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
we had one of these basically bigger lecture rooms.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It's very hard to guess how many people have been there,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
so the room was pretty full,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and there was a huge interest in this topic,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
so I'd say a few hundred, maybe,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
but don't talk me on that,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
so I'm pretty poor in counting people.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
However, there was a huge interest,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and I think, from the questions that came,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
it's also clear that there is still a lot of uncertainty

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
when it comes to M-I-N-S-Dewart,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and if I am a steward, what do I have to do?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And I have to feeling that some people in our community

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
are feeling the rules,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and that they think that, for example,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
issue could be that some sort of

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
continuity agencies that don't have too much to do with open source,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
want to be one of those stewards to earn money worth this,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and how to prevent this,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and I think there's also a lot of fear on the obligations

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
that stewards might have that there's too much bureaucracy in this,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and that they simply can't do it.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And these are precisely the points we also want to

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
bring to the market surveillance authority,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and for this I think it was also good.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
That they have been there, and that they have seen,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
like physically seeing how people are worried about this,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and that there is definitely needed to stay

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and touch with these people to communicate with these people

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
to include them in the debate,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and to remove a bit of the fog,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
which might be around this CIA,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
because ultimately I think it has more chances than downsides,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
if you play it right during this implementation.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And that's something I have to feeling that people understood,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
so nothing is lost so far.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
It's still in the making,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and we are actively searching for people contributing to this,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and if our community understood,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and this is I think what this panel definitely had for,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
is that there is still room for improvements,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
then this is something which is,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
the solar effects, that's what I think.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So as you said, that the people from their commissioner

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
are who, because there will be

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
some agency that will define this to us,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
so people from this planned agency,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
or who was there and saw that some people are very worried about

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
this whole server itself.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So basically it's the person who is working in the BSI,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
the sort of department, which might be in charge

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
of the Cyber Resilience Act in the implementation.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
The thing is that the CIA itself,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
was just really released by the end of last year,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
so member states are still discussing

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
who ultimately will be market surveillance authority,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
so it's not set in stone,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
but it's likely that the BSI will be,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and ultimately the person who was there,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and Michael is also the person,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
this whom I'm running the project together with CBI,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
in order to figure out how this relationship looked like.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
So basically, one could say the representatives

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
of the department that will be in charge was there,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and for this, it's a thing,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
that's also sort of a very strong commitment

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
that market surveillance authorities do not only want

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
to work with manufacturers,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
or that they have only in eye for the industry,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
but they also go actively to our community

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
in order to learn about our demands or fears,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and I think that's something very valuable

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
that Michael showed up and not only listen,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
but also actively to part in this Q&amp;A session

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and try to address those questions

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and trying to take away some of the fears

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that are in the room.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
That I can imagine.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
But so this was a successful era

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and session in the EU and quality of what else happened there.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I think that it must have been not the only session there,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
right? There were loads more.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And here do you were hanging around there the whole day?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So it's always a intense experience.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I mean, we start at 10, 30 and at 7,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
so that's quite a while.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And also I have to say that many people

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
stayed for the whole day in the room.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So obviously we had an interesting agenda

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and often we also had to close the doors

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
since the room was so packed that we can't let everybody in.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So for all of you that couldn't see the talk,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
they wanted to see there are also recordings

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
on the first and back side itself,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
where you can watch all the talks

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and also on FFE.org.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
You find the news item in the blog post

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
where we also report about what happened.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I want to highlight in this podcast again,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
a very practical talk we had,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
which is on the mandatory B2B e-in voices

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and which this means for software.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I think that was a very interesting talk

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
since it addresses a very practical hands-on question

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
that is basically coming to us,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
which in the first place doesn't look like a free software problem,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
but there are some strings attached to the free software community.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So that was a pretty hands-on talk,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I think this is also always nice to have.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Also we discussed in this like hands-on tool related topic,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
a tool from the UBIN data protection board,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
which is basically a compliance tool

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
where you can check how your website is in line with data protection laws

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and this is also an open source tool.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So here we can see how UBIN institutions

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
also are made use of open source tools

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
in order to fulfill the obligations in order to help.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Companies out there are in this case like,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
yeah, people who run a website.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Also I mean, which is very important for us,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
in particular for the FSE is the discussion we have on the DNA

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and the Apple litigation case.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So my colleague Lucas is working on basically

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
interoperability question when it comes to the App Store on iOS,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
so Apple phones and tablets.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And here we run a legal activity against Apple

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and that was in particular interesting

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
since there was a fire side chat with somebody

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
or with two people from the UBIN commission

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
that were giving insights in their daily work,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
how they do this and yeah,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
what questions arise when we talk about the gatekeeper issue,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
device neutrality topics and how we legally try to enforce this

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
together with the commission to make sure that on the Apple,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
as device is this in the future possible

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
to, for example, also install the F-Troid app store

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and by that you will be able to also get apps.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
There are not coming from this Apple universe

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
but can be free software from the F-Troid store, for example.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So a very interesting legal case.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I think it will be somehow also covered in this podcast episode

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
since there will be some results one day

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and we hope to be able to safeguard device neutrality business.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And yeah, that was also in particular,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
since people from the UBIN commission showed up again

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I think a sign that's European institutions

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
that institutions in general do take care of what we do

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
that they follow our arguments even more

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and that they also even more up to also join these kind of like community events

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
like the first them and explain their work towards this community

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
and I think that's also a very strong statement

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
from the commission to join these fireside chat.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Where you know it's the first them,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
people are very critical to people

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and they sometimes ask questions that are not so nice

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
for institution people or decision makers,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
but they show up, they took the questions

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and that's I think something we should also value

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
that more and more people from the institutions

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
are coming on a week and to explain their work

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and that's also a good result of our work at check.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Yeah, it makes them more approachable, right?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
I just thought that this was like,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
it's actually a chance to engage with policy makers

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
and to talk about your fears and your thoughts

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
and bring them to their attention.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Absolutely, and I do believe a dialogue is always better

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
to have with the people we want to basically address

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
with our demands, so it's better to talk with them

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
instead of over them and for this I think it's also underlying

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
how important this event is and that they see

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
that it is an important event for them

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
to go there and to meet these kind of stakeholders

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
so that they are not only meeting the industry

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
in the hidden hotel during the week,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
but that they also actively go on a Saturday

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
to the university to an event

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
which is absolutely crazy

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
and if you have there for the very first time

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
in particular, if you are living in the process but

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
it's the complete opposite of what you normally see

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
how people advocate for something

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
and that they do the step that something

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
really valued a lot.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Okay, I can't imagine, I think that's a very nice of them

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
and it shows a lot of commitment to the community.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
This is a short break for our own cause.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Thank you for listening to this afternoon podcast.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Working for software freedom and producing podcasts,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
cost money.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Please consider supporting us with a donation

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
on the ffs.org slash donate at the show notes.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
So this was the legal and policy too.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
That room.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
But I remember we had two.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Yes.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
We did have another one.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
It was one on Sunday.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Yeah.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
It was the post funding.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Yeah, since this other day it's not enough of work.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I also decided to have no with some other organizations

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
to come up with a funding there from here.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
For example, we worked with the sovereignty agency from Germany.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
We worked with the Linux foundation, the prototype fund.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
So people that are also already active in this sphere of funding.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
We came together, I'd say,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
mid last year and decided on the idea to propose a funding

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
that room.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
We precisely discussed basically all questions that arise

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
from funding.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
So for example, from whom do you want to take funding?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
From whom not?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Is there a way how we can identify, for example,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
very important projects or core infrastructure that we want to support?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
How much money do we want to give them?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Is there some sort of communication or some sort of activity

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
to be more successful in fundraising, for example?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
So there are many discussions on funds on funding on where

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
money should come from, and all of these discussions

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
happening here and there, but not like on one place.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And that's why we decided to come up with this dedicated funding

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
that room and I think that was also a huge success.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
So also this room was pretty packed during the whole day.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And we had many, many submissions also in the first place.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
So we had to be very picky on the talks we had.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And ultimately, but I think we came up with a very, very nice agenda

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
that addressed most of the topics that somehow arise

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
when we talk about funding.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
And also the discussions after every talk show that there is really

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
in need for this discussion that there is a lot of expertise.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Also, that was very nice to see that many participants who

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
maybe had been rejected by their talk due to the nature of this very short date,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
which we had basically just eight hours, where we discussed this topic.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
But still in the room and sharing the expertise.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
And that was pretty nice to see that it was not just like people talking

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
and sharing the experience from the stage, but that there was also a lot

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
of interaction with the people in the room that also not only ask questions,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
but also added a lot of very useful information.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
And for example, sources, so where you can look for money,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
how to do this, they shared the experience.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And I think that was basically what the deaf room should look like, right?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
So that there is a discussion ongoing that there is,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
one could say, something starts there.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
So I had a feeling that after this deaf room,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000
more and more people are now connected and can work together and collaborate on these questions.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
So I would be very happy to see this deaf room again next year,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
and maybe to see if there was already some sort of progress.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Or if there are some new questions, I mean,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
we both also talked about the funding topic that we discussed.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
I think two at this also go, go.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
So there are also discussions ongoing, not only in the European Union,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
but also in member states and globally,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
how to invest in core infrastructure,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
how to invest in digital to sovereignty,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
but world plays free software and all of this.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And I think it's a good idea that our community is networking and collaborating on those questions in order to be able to influence these discussions happening on the European level.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Like this input from us,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
because I do believe that our community is basically that one that can help in this debate a lot,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
in order to identify who are the people that need money,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
which are the projects that need support,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
and which are the other projects where we could also say,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
this is something that the market should invest,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
and not us taxpayers money.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
I think there are different sources we need to discuss,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
we are managed to come from and it should always be private and public.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
So in this, these are some questions that are not that easy

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
to discuss when it comes again to the needy query,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000
and here I think it's a good idea if we can up this idea as out of our community ourselves,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
and point to the right project that needs support,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
and discuss this also within our community,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
how we do believe funding for the free software ecosystem should look like,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
and what's good for us is community and what not.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
And therefore this deaf room was super helpful.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
It was also pretty hands on if you are a project and you struggle with finding money.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
There are definitely talks, you should watch again,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
also here these talks are all recorded.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
So you can go on the first step side,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
channel to the deaf room, click the talk,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
and you will find the recording of the talk.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
So you can watch all of this again,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
or I said, saying here we will also have a blog post,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
and use the item on fissivee.org.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Where we report about this deaf room,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
and where you can also find recordings and rewatch,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
what's interesting for you.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And I will also link them in the show notes.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Yes.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Perfect.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Not all of the videos separately,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
but the deaf room that you can go through the talk.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Exactly.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
And then what's the recording?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Because otherwise it would be a bit too much.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Maybe I can attach also here,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
a call to our community,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
or to our listeners of this podcast episode.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
So if you are working on the topic of funding,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
or if you are interested in the topic of funding,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
if you want to contribute with this debate,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
you're also free to reach out to me directly,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
or to contact at fissivee.org.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
So we are still in the very early phase,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
I'd say, of this debate,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
and it will keep us busy,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
I do believe for the next term.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
So basically for the next five years,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
you should debate,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
we are discussing,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
you will stick a one-stack,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
we are discussing core infrastructure,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
we are discussing innovation in Europe,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
the new digital program will be coming up into years

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
where there might be potential sources for funding.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
So the discussion is just about to start,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
so if you want to take part in this discussion,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
if you have ideas,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
if you have points,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
or if you also have experience,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
which is a big interest for us,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
and if you are free to reach out to us.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
That one's a good idea to get all of us,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
if you could together,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
and to start with this discussion,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
also outside of Boston.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
But what was the best thing that happened in this,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
of course,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
funding,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
deaf room for you,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
like what really stood out for you?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
What was the something I better to ask us to hire to name?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
So I don't want to pick a specific talk,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
but what I really liked was,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
what I already said,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
that there was a lot of interaction in the deaf room.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
So, and that there was basically participants,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
and speakers have been on eye level,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
and it had been a very good exchange.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
I do believe that also speakers took some sort of information

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
that was new to them away from this deaf room,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
and that's something which is really good.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
And I do believe also that this deaf room helped a lot,

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
and in order to bring people together,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
to see who else is working on this topic,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
and to be able to network with those people,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
and to be able to collaborate in the future,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
and that's,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
I think,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
the biggest result of this deaf room,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
and yeah,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
bringing people together,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
and pointing to it,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
and giving it the importance with,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
like also a dedicated deaf room,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
showed that there is the need to discuss this,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
that there is a need from the community,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
and people are already working on this,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
but that they are not,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
well, network together,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
but this room definitely had to,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
to create this,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
get people closer together,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
absolutely.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
And that was,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
that was basically the best outcome for me,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
however,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
as said,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
so there is definitely something,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
which is super interesting,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
so for me,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
in particular,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
the question on combining public and private efforts,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
so how we can bring together the market,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
and the taxpayers in order to support,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
free software ecosystem,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
that's one of the most interesting questions for me,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
because I do believe,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
it should not only be taxpayers money,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
but also private money,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
and there,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
it's definitely a question,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
how can we push the market,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
how can we,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
in particular, push those who benefit from,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
feel software,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
but don't contribute back,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
how can we push them,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
and the very interesting part here is,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
that we can even combine this,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
we can combine this debate,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
with the cyber resilience act,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
as we dare have these roles of the Stuart and manufacturer,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
and we want the manufacturer supporting the Stuart,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
so you can see that we,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
with this topic,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
also,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
and using other files to create awareness about this topic,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
and this topic of funding is discussed in many debates,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
but it's not that there is,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
this one funding debate happening in Europe,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
at the moment,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
at the moment,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
it's still a lot of peace work,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
and I do believe that this,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
that we just address these questions,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
we've already helped us to showcase,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
that there's not this one single question in this,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
niche debate,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
but that there's ongoing overall funding debate,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000
which is basically asking for public and private money,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
for innovation,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
for core infrastructure,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
and for digital digital sovereignty,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
and to come up with one answer to this,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
needs collaboration,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
it needs working together,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
and understanding in which niche's people are working on this topic,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
in order to have shared approach,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
so to say,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
to the funding question,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
and that we can also use the niche debates

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
to show that there are other debates

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
ongoing in other files as well.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Yeah,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
I would like to pick out the word,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
as you mentioned,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
working together, creating that book,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
and also highlight the part

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
that we at FSAFE took a lot of time

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
to go through all of those talks,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
to like,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
put energy in there and to create those rooms

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
for the whole community to network into you,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
get together,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
but we also depend on your support.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
So please consider supporting us with the nation,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
and you can find information on the FSAFE.org slash donate,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
as we can only continue our work for free software here support.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
This is something that I would like to highlight

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
during the context of working,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
because I was just thinking,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
during the whole time I thought,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
oh my god,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Alex has spent a lot of time

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
and effort to create those rooms,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
and I think this is something

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
that the whole community benefited by, you know?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
I hope so, I hope so, and I had a feeling.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Yeah.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
And I also have to add,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
as the normally,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
not only the preparation of the FSAFE,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
it's very time consuming,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
but also the days afterwards,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
or even the weeks afterwards.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
So since you normally run into so many people during FSAFE,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
and you start so many short chats

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
where you agree on,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
oh we need to continue this conversation,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
but it's for them,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
you know, I have to run to the next meeting,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
and you collect even addresses,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
and a lot of things,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
and several communication networks,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
and I'm still struggling,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
some may it's that I still have to send.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
So it's not only what's happening that day,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
it's one part is the preparation,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
the another part is being there for two days,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
more than nine hours in those deaf rooms,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
without any sunlight.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
And then the part which comes afterwards,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
and at one day,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
we will start again preparing the next FSAFE,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
so it's basically FSAFE keeps us busy for the whole year,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
one could say,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
and that I can do my work,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
in order to realize these kind of deaf rooms,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
but in order to follow up,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
so it's not just like,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
that we do these deaf rooms for fun.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
We also want to have impact business,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
and this needs follow up,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
and this needs a lot of time.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
And as said,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
for example, with the funding thing,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
we are just starting,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
to be able to do this,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
and I say,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
as a whole community,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
and bringing these people together,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
also takes time,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
it needs energy,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
finding common ground,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
see where we can work together,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
and this needs a lot of time,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
resources,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
and if you donate to us,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
you make this work possible,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
you make our sites for funding possible,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
and then also,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
one day we'll benefit you,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
if you,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
for example,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
a developer,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
and maybe we'll get funds for your project in the future.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Perfect.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
I would like to take this as a closing word,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
because we,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
exceeded a bit of our time,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
11,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
but I had a very fine chat with you.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Thank you so much,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Alex,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
for making this possible.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Thank you so much for your work,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
on free software,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
and advocating for free software in the European Union.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
I think this is a really valuable work,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
and I really appreciate working with you together,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
thank you.

Thank you so much.
