    <title>Free Your Android</title>
    <description>
      Android is a mostly free operating system developed mainly by
      Google. Unfortunately, the drivers for most devices and most
      applications in the in-built store are not Free Software. This
      activity helps you to regain control of your Android device and
      your data. We collect information about running an Android system
      as free as possible and try to coordinate the efforts in this
      area.
