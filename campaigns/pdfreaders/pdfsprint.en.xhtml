	in web SVN)</li>

</ol>

<h3>Desirable</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Projector  for showing examples of adverts, demonstrating bug reporting 
	page, and projecting identi.ca / chat room feed</li>
	<li>Speakers  for background music</li>
	<li>A small prize for the person who finds the most adverts (eg. box of 
	chocolates)</li>
	<li>FSFE leaflets and booth materials  for promoting FSFE to attendees</li>
	<li>Assistance transporting materials to the event venue</li>
	<li>A list of the websites of local councils in your country / area for 
	attendees to work through</li>
</ol>


<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>Assemble a group of Free Software activists and:</p>

<ol>

	<li>Find adverts for proprietary PDF readers on government websites in your 
	country/area</li>
	<li>Send letters to the institutions responsible asking them to remove or 
	replace the adverts</li>
	<li>A model letter can be found on the PDF Readers campaign page, and another in 
	web SVN. You can modify the letter for easier printing, or to make it more 
	relevant to your country/area.</li>

</ol>

<p>Don't forget to microblog about what you're doing, and use the #pdfreaders tag 
when you do so. You may also want to use tags like #openstandards or #opengov.</p>


<h2>Optional</h2>

<ol>

	<li>Publish a press release in the run up to the event</li>
	<li>Organise an interview with local radio or podcast in the run up to the event</li>
	<li>Send a copy of petition signatures from people in your country/area in 
	addition to the letter regarding the specific bug to each institution</li>
	<li>Email the institutions a copy of the printed letter and optional list of 
	signatures</li>
	<li>Send follow up letters to institutions that have been contacted in the past 
	and failed to comply</li>

</ol>

<h2>Note on scripts</h2>

<p>I've created an additional script for processing bug mails. It is written in 
PHP and generates .odt files directly. The existing Python script is more 
functional, but less well documented, so you can take your pick (both are in 
SVN)!</p>
