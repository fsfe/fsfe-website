	<h3 id="Ada">Ada &amp; Zangemann movie: celebrating Ada Lovelace Day with our community</h3> 

	<p>The FSFE celebrated Ada Lovelace Day on October 8 with a special 
	event for its supporters: the global English premiere of the 
	animated movie <strong>'Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of Software, Skateboards, 
	and Raspberry Ice Cream'</strong>. Vint Cerf, often referred to as one of 
	the "fathers of the Internet", and Franziska Heine, Executive 
	Director of Wikimedia Germany, gave special speeches during the 
	event.</p> <p>The movie is now published <a href="https://ada.fsfe.org/movie">on the FSFE's website</a> and 
	made available to the public under the Creative Commons By 
	Share-Alike Licence, as an Open Education Resource. During the next 
	months the FSFE will release other language version of the movie on 
	<a href="https://ada.fsfe.org/movie">ada.fsfe.org/movie</a>.</p> 

	<p><em>Share the movie and all the Ada &amp; Zangemann resources with your community!</em></p>
	
	<h3 id="NGI-funding">The FSFE demanded the EU Commission sustainable long-term Free Software funding</h3> 

	<p>Recently, the European Commission announced <a href="/news/2024/news-20240719-01.html">a €27 million cut</a> 
	in the funding allocated to the Next Generation Internet (NGI) 
	initiative, which has supported Free Software projects with funding 
	and technical assistance since 2018. Despite its proven success, 
	the European Commission decided to cut this funding in the current 
	draft of the Horizon Europe 2025 Work Programme, highlighting the 
	larger issue of the lack of long-term, sustainable public funding 
	for Free Software projects. Since July, we have been active on this 
	issue, <a href="/news/2024/news-20240808-01.html">we tried to get in touch with the European Commission</a>, 
	reached out to our community and <a href="/news/2024/news-20240828-01.html">spread the news</a> around 
	Europe.</p>
	
	<p>Recently, <a href="/news/2024/news-20240911-01.html">the FSFE participated in a public consultation</a> 
	organized by the European Commission to provide feedback on the 
	EU's Digital Europe funding programme, emphasizing that cutting 
	funding for Free Software risks steering Europe away from policies 
	that ensure people’s control over their own technology. At the same 
	time, <a href="/news/2024/news-20240911-02.html">we asked the community to do the same</a> and to take part in the 
	consultation.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Our call was heard:</strong> the consultation received <em>789 
	responses</em>, <em>70%</em> of which came from individual citizens. Together, we 
	made it clear that long-term, dedicated funding for Free Software 
	is essential to ensuring Europe’s control over its technological 
	future. We thank everyone who took part in amplifying the Free 
	Software community’s voice. Once public, we will analyse the 
	results and will follow up with the Commission and other EU bodies 
	with those results; to make sure your voice remains heard.</p>
	
	<p>This consultation was not a stand-alone event—it is a key step in our 
	ongoing effort to ensure that Free Software receives long-term, 
	sustainable funding. We remain committed to influencing policy 
	decisions and advocating for Free Software, and we will keep you 
	informed as we continue this important work. The EU’s digital 
	strategy can only reach its full potential if it systematically 
	focuses on Free Software. We will continue our efforts to make sure 
	software freedom is consistently supported across Europe with the 
	needed sustainable long-term fund.</p> 


	<h3 id="Apple-EC">Apple vs Commission: The FSFE submits its arguments</h3>

	<p>In August this year, the FSFE was <a href="/news/2024/news-20240812-01.html">admitted in the litigation 
	brought by Apple</a> against the European Commission in relation to the 
	Digital Markets Act (DMA). Apple is trying to avoid obligations 
	related to its App Store and the interoperability of its operating 
	system and devices.</p>

	<p>On 12th September the FSFE submitted its arguments, arguing how 
	interoperability is key for our digital societies. Apple must abide 
	DMA obligations not only for fairer competition on digital markets 
	but also for open internet, software freedom and better device and 
	software security. More information will be publish soon on our website.</p>

	<h3 id="YH4F">Software Freedom in Europe 2024</h3>
	 
	<p>In September we published our annual report, <a href="/news/2024/news-20240920-01.html">Software Freedom in 
	Europe</a>. This report highlights our achievements, showcasing our 
	success stories, milestones and activities over the past twelve 
	months.</p>
