  <h1>Dutch authority enforces Router Freedom</h1>

  <p>
    The Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) has published new rules
    that will move Router Freedom forward in the Netherlands. Within 6 months
    ISPs have to comply and offer the option for
    consumers and companies to connect a modem or router of their own choice.
    The FSFE acknowledges this decision as a major win for consumer rights.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="/activities/routers/">Router Freedom</a> is the
    right that consumers of any Internet Service Provider (ISP) have to choose and use a private modem and
    router instead of equipment that the ISP provides. In its <a
    href="https://www.acm.nl/sites/default/files/documents/beleidsregel-handhaving-besluit-eindapparaten.pdf">publication
    (.pdf)</a> the Dutch Authority cites the <a
    href="https://berec.europa.eu/eng/document_register/subject_matter/berec/regulatory_best_practices/guidelines/9277-berec-guidelines-on-the-implementation-of-the-open-internet-regulation">BEREC
    Guidelines on the Implementation of the Open Internet Regulation</a> as the
    reason for stating the <a
    href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/consumers-and-businesses-are-allowed-choose-their-own-modems">new
    rules</a>. These guidelines came about with the persistent effort of the
    FSFE to draw attention to the importance of and right to Router Freedom. As
    another motivation the ACM explicitly mentions the "significant" group of
    users wanting to take control of their personal data and network devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    The new regulation clarifies which part of the infrastructure falls under
    the governance of the ISP and for which part the user is free to choose
    their own solution. Router Freedom also implies a user is still free to
    choose a modem or router offered by the ISP. It is an important step forward
    that this practice will be the norm from 27 February 2022 and will be
    enforced by the Dutch regulator. Although the legal aspects have been
    defined now in the Netherlands, in practice Router Freedom was <a
    href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters">already tolerated
    in the country</a>. Most ISPs indicated that they allow consumers to connect
    their own preferred devices. One even gives consumers a discount if they use
    their own router or modem.
  </p>


  <h2>The details</h2>

  <p>
    An important step forward is the explicit choice by the ACM for the Network
    Termination Point (NTP). The BEREC Guidelines suggest three possible
    locations, in short A) at the end of the cable B) after the modem C) after
    the router or mediabox. The ACM has opted for the NTP to be at the end of
    the cable, offering the maximum of flexibility to the user. This "passive"
    termination point avoids users having to accept the operation of a device
    outside of their control, and allows for Router Freedom.

  <p>
    The new rules contain statements on what service should be provided. ISPs
    are allowed to publish a list of devices, but cannot limit the support to
    only that list of devices. ISPs should provide the administrative measures
    within one working day. ISPs maintain the ability to disconnect a user in
    case damage is done to the network. For troubleshooting a policy is
    described by which first the ISP has to check it is not their network that
    is faulty, after which the user can be requested to use a known working
    device provided by the ISP to verify it is not the different modem or router
    that is at fault. In case the custom modem or router is at fault, the ISP is
    allowed to request a financial compensation for providing the known working
    device for testing purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Space for improvement</h2>

  <p>
    ACM's decision is a major win for all end-users in the Netherlands. The
    decision provides more clarity on the legal aspects involving the NTP.
    However, ISPs' commercial practices involving routers and modems still pose
    barriers against end-users' Router Freedom:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Most ISPs currently offer little to no support for users wanting to
    install their own router;</li>
    <li>Most ISPs demand you still lease a modem as part of the service and keep
    it stored;</li>
    <li>Most ISPs don't offer the same level of service like IPv6 when choosing
    your own router;</li>
    <li>
      Some ISPs offer IPTV (streaming television) solutions that rely on
      different channels than the internet service and so these mediaboxes will
      not work in combination with a custom modem. This point is underscored by
      the ACM as something that they will be reevaluating in the future.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The new rules don't contain statements that will change the situation on
    these points, so the FSFE will continue to call for a more robust Router
    Freedom and monitor the situation in the Netherlands.

  <h2>The Router Freedom initiative</h2>

  <p>
    Since 2013, the Free Software Foundation Europe has engaged with Router
    Freedom, promoting end-users' freedom to choose and use their own terminal
    equipment - first in Germany as a precedent, and now in many European
    countries. Join us and learn more about the several ways to get <a
