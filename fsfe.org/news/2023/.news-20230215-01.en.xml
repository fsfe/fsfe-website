<h1>Thank you for helping us reach our goal!</h1>

<p>Thanks to your valuable contributions, we have reached our 
fundraising target*. Thank you for your confidence and support, even in 
these difficult times. These funds will help us run our campaigns and 
organise events and talks to spread the word about our work, while 
continuing to promote software freedom.</p>

<p>Thanks to your donation, we will continue this year with our <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money? Public Code! initiative</a> 
that publicly funded software must be made available to the public 
under a Free Software licence. We will continue to focus on the need 
for verifiable and trustworthy AI technologies, and Free Software is 
crucial to achieve this. We have prepared a <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/AIandFS/fsfe_AIandFreesoftware.pdf">dedicated 
document for decision-makers</a> which highlights the benefits that Free Software can bring to crucial regulation. We are also 
asking the EU Parliament to incorporate its own position into the 
European AI Regulation. </p>

<p>In the coming months, we will also call for the consolidation of 
device neutrality to allow fair and non-discriminatory use of Free 
Software in digital devices, as well as Open Standards. Both are 
fundamental to achieving an open and competitive digital market. FSFE 
will continue to dedicate initiatives that focus on specific aspects of 
how end-users use and interact with devices.</p>

<p>*We'd especially like to thank one of our volunteers who, at the end 
of the campaign and after realising that we hadn't reached our target, 
stepped in and donated the amount we 
needed to reach our target.</p>
