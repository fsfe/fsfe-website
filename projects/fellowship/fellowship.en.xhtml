<h1>Fellowship of FSFE</h1>
</center>

 <p>The Fellowship is a community for digital freedom.</p>

<p>It is the place where the Fellows of the Free Software Foundation Europe meet and come together to share ideas, collaborate on projects and inform each other about what is going on in the world of Free Software. The Fellowship is a community of people who take interest in the multiple interactions of Free Software with economy, politics, science and society and seek to change things for the better.</p>
<p>Joining the Fellowship is the easiest and most direct way to get involved with, remain informed about and support the work of the Free Software Foundation Europe. Besides a &quot;login@fsfe.org&quot; mail address, a homepage and a blog, each Fellow receives  a Cryptocard developed by Werner Koch, the author of GnuPG. This permits data and email encryption at a security level hitherto almost inaccessible to the private user.</p>

<p>The Fellowship site can be found at
