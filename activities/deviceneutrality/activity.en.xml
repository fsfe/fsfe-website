    <title>Device Neutrality</title>
    <description>
      Although digital devices are ubiquotous today, the number of devices on which users
      cannot run Free Software is exponentially increasing. The consequence is an increased
      loss of control over users’ technology. Device Neutrality aims to
      enable end-users to bypass gatekeepers to have a non-discriminatory use of
      Free Software on their devices.
