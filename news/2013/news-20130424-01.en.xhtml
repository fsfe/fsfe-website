	<p> A group of Free Software activists from Romania and Moldova has joined FSFE's program of <a href="/associates/associates.html#id-funda%C8%9Bia-ceata">associate organisations</a>. Active since 2008, <a href="http://ceata.org">Ceata</a> incorporated as a foundation in February 2013. Fundația Ceata and FSFE will work together to promote software freedom in Romania and throughout Europe.</p>

	<p>"We are proud to join forces with the skilled and passionate Free Software activists of Ceata", says Karsten Gerloff, FSFE's president."Free Software needs people like these, and they need the backing of an organisation to be effective in the long term. Ceata has a bright future."</p>

	<p>For the past years, Ceata has been setting up workshops, hackathons and campaigns around Free Software and free culture in Romania and Moldova. The group, based in Bucharest and with local chapters in Cluj and Chișinău, organises conferences on Free Software, free hardware and free culture, develops Free Software, translates Free Software programs into Romanian, and participates in international campaigns.</p>

	<p>"We share a common vision of software freedom for everyone," says Tiberiu C. Turbureanu, Ceata's president. "Together, we can bring this freedom to more people in Romania, Moldova and Europe at large. We are excited to officially be part of the Free Software movement in Europe."
