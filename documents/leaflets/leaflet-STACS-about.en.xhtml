	<h2>The STACS project</h2> <!-- scribus style: "project paper" -->

	<h2>Abstract</h2> <!-- abstact area -->
	<!-- scribus style: all paragraphs in the abstract area use the "abstract" style -->
	<p>The European vision of a knowledge-based society demands an early dialogue between scientists, policy makers and civil society, but the issue of civil society involvement in research has largely been neglected. The FSFE is participating, along with six other partners, in a project that seeks to bridge this gap between civil society organisations and research, and thereby increase the societal relevance of the research being done in Europe and elsewhere.</p>

	<h3>The goals of the project</h3> <!-- scribus style: all h3 use "subject in text" -->

	<p>The STACS project (Science, Technology and Civil Society) will give civil society organisations the knowledge required to participate in research, identify research areas and researchers interested in such cooperation, and find common projects to work on for the future.</p>

	<p>More specifically, the STACS project will provide:</p>
	
	<ul> <!-- scribus style: all item are in style "item" -->
		<li>training sessions on socially important scientific issues to build the capacity of civil society,</li>
		<li>workshops to identify interesting research topics for cooperation, especially in the European Commission 7th framework programme,</li>
		<li>a web site to provide a platform for exchange between civil society and scientists,</li>
		<li>an analysis of the European research system,</li>
		<li>increased awareness of and for civil society,</li>
		<li>opportunities for the members of the European Parliament to get engaged in the promotion of civil society in research.</li>
	</ul>	

	<h3>The partners</h3>
	
	<p>The partners participating in this project are Association pour la création d'une Fondation Sciences Citoyennes (coordinating), European Public Health Alliance, Réseaux Semences Paysannes, Greenpeace UK, DEMOS, and Institut Mensch from France, Belgium, United Kingdom, and Germany.</p>

	<h3>The role of the FSFE</h3>
	
	<p>FSFE participates in the project to provide the necessary competence on Free Software and related fields. We will organise a training session for civil society on Free Software, as well as a workshop for researchers and civil society both to identify projects related to Free Software to work on.</p>
