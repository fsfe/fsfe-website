<h1>Green Party minor interpellation (kleine Anfrage) expected to clarify status quo of 'LiMux'</h1>


<p newsteaser="yes">
	
The Green Party has recently posed a minor interpellation (kleine Anfrage) in order to obtain detailed information on the alleged issues related to the Linux-based desktop environment of the city Munich. The reason is that for some time, rumors have been circulating in the press regarding a possible switch back to a proprietary environment. To date, however, no detailed information is available explaining what these issues are and how they are related to the operating system used, and most of the statements and interviews that are commonly cited contain vague statements and opinions.
</p>
<p>
It appears that the city is undertaking an evaluation of its IT infrastructure using a „panel of experts“, but it has not disclosed any details on their identities or qualifications.  
On thing is clear: the current state of available information is insufficient to imply any consequences or conclusions regarding the future of Linux within the city of Munich. The FSFE is eagerly awaiting the city's answer to the interpellation, since a clear view on possible issues within the city allows for the formulation of strategies to solve them. A large-scale institution such as the city of Munich with more than 14,000 workstations can face a large number of challenges ranging from rigid bureaucratic structures to outdated hardware and issues present in any IT-configuration of such a size. One of the great benefits of Free Software is that it can solve many of these issues by introducing taylormade software solutions. 
</p>
<p>
The consequences of switching back to a proprietary vendor can additionally imply negative consequences that are not immediately obvious but nonetheless relevant. Among them are re-occurring periodical licensing costs, commitment to quasi-monopolistic economic structures, the loss of manufacturing highly individual software solutions to fit specific needs, as well as the abandonment of the highest possible level of software transparency and thus security in terms of privacy and data-usage. The FSFE hopes that the city of Munich will avoid taking a short-sighted perspective by paying attention to these factors rather than isolating their view on cost and user satisfaction.
