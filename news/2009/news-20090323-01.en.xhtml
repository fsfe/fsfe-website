<h1>FSFE announces the second European Licensing and Legal Workshop for Free Software</h1>

<p>Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) today announces that the second European Licensing and Legal Workshop will be held at the Hotel Okura on the 23rd and the 24th of April 2009 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This conference will provide a forum for discussions on supply chain management, compliance procedures, licence management, community interaction, and other legal issues related to the growth of the European Free Software market.</p>

<p>The European Licensing and Legal Workshop is an event held primarily for the members of the European Legal Network, a private, non-partisan network of 185 Free Software experts across 27 countries and 4 continents facilitated by FSFE.  There is limited space available at the event and attendance for non-network members is by invitation only.

<p>The European Licensing and Legal Workshop is kindly supported by Bender von Haller Dragsted, Blackduck, Canonical, HP and Mozilla.</p>

<p>This event is one of the activities of FSFE's Freedom Task Force (FTF). The FTF is an infrastructure activity to help individuals, projects and businesses understand Free Software licensing and the opportunities that it presents. The FTF works in partnership with gpl-violations.org to deal with licence violations in the European arena.  The goal of the FTF is to foster best practice throughout the industry.</p>
