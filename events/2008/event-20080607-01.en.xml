    <title>Social event in ZÃ¼rich - meet the FSFE!</title>
    <body>
      This year's General Assembly of FSFE takes place in Zurich, and as usual,
      there will be a social event where the members of the General Assembly
      meet Fellows and other local Free Software supporters.<br/>
      Around 18:20 the crowd will leave from the FSFE office at
      <a href="http://map.search.ch/zuerich/sumatrastr.25">Sumatrastrasse 25</a>
      and  walk through the old town in direction to Bellview.<br/>
      At 19:00 we will catch a
      <a href="http://www.zsg.ch/index.php?kleinerundfahrten_zuerich_1900">ferry</a>
      from
      <a href="http://map.search.ch/zuerich/buerkliplatz">Zurich Burkiplatz</a>.
      <br/>
      At 19:47 the ferry will arrive in Erlenbach where we will continue the
      evening with a nice barbecue in the
      <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=47.306837,8.589195&amp;spn=0.003579,0.007725&amp;z=17&amp;msid=102228799921318446795.00044ed8c00982aa76dc7">park</a>.
      If you decide to join us directly for the barbecue look for the
      fellowship flag to locate us.<br/>
      Bring whatever you want to put on the grill and drinks to last you until
      23:00 when we will conclude the social evening as some of us have to
      wake up early on Sunday to continue working :)
