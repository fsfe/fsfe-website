    <h1>Strategic freedom: Free Software in the public sector</h1>

    <!-- please do not translate, as this is still a draft -->

    <p class="background">
Free Software is a perfect fit for the public sector. It is a public
resource that government organisations can use, study, improve, and
share with each other. For citizens, this means transparency, cost
efficiency, and the freedom to interact with their government in the
way that suits them best.
    </p>

    <p class="background">
Yet public bodies often put Free Software at a disadvantage. This
means that they are spending taxpayers' money in ways that are often
wasteful, and frequently illegal. FSFE works with public sector
organisations at all levels - from the European Commission to local
administrations - to systematically improve procurement practices
across the continent.
    </p>
   

   <h2>Why procurement matters </h2>

    <p>
Public procurement spending equals nearly 20% of the EU's
GDP. Governments' buying decisions can determine the success or
failure of whole industries. Energy-saving technology and recycled
paper only came into widespread use because governments started buying
them. The same mechanism applies to Free Software. Many public adminstrations that
begin using Free Software see their IT costs drop by 50-90%.
    </p>



   <h2>FSFE speaks up when things go wrong...</h2>

    <p>
Many public bodies remain locked into their traditional suppliers of
proprietary software.  At FSFE, we work with journalists and
researchers to highlight the work of public sector organisations that
are doing it right. When a public body makes mistakes, we help them to
correct them. And when necessary, we put pressure on organisations
that insist on harmful ways of buying software.
    </p>

    <h2>...and offers independent solutions</h2>

    <p>
      At FSFE, we are in constant dialogues with procurement
      specialists across Europe. We observe new approaches, identify
      what works, and provide analysis to decision makers. We help
      specialists in different countries learn from each other. 
    </p>
    <p>
  
      We help procurement officials understand the full impact of
      their actions, and we help them to do better - not only for
      their organisations, but also for the citizens whom they serve.
    </p>


    <p>
      By helping governments to buy and use more Free Software, FSFE
      is driving real change. Please support us in this effort.
