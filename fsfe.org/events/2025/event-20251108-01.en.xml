      <p>The IT of tomorrow needs to have the active participation of diverse teams, that take into consideration the point of view and perspectives of the whole society. Currently the perspective of women and other underrepresented communities have not being included so at this workshop we want to explore our role in shaping an inclusive, open and digital sovereign future together!</p>
     <p>Together, we’ll reflect on the barriers we face (from access and visibility to inclusion and recognition) and share strategies, stories, and practical examples that have helped us thrive in Free Software. Our goal is not only to build solidarity and support, but to surface good practices that can make Free Software truly inclusive.</p>
     <p>This workshop is an open space by and for women, and other under-represented communities.</p>
