	<h1>EURA vs. Slovak Tax Authorities</h1>
 
	<div id="introduction">
	 
		<p>Slovak textile importer EURA Slovakia, s.r.o. is facing EUR 5600 in fines because it did not buy and use the Microsoft Windows operating system for submitting electronic tax reports. Slovak tax administration gave EURA only two options: either it buys and use Microsoft Windows or face the fines. This is also how we could briefly summarize the decision of Slovak tax administration from May 2012.</p>

	</div>

The administration imposed several fines on a company, EURA Slovakia, which submitted its tax reports on paper, because the use of electronic form was impossible as the state's web application worked only on the Microsoft Windows operating system. The company appealed to the court and to demand that the state stops forcing businesses to use a certain product, instead of requiring that the public administration uses a multi-platform technical solution based on Open Standards that is available for everybody.

		<h2>Background of the case</h2>
		<p>Since January 2010 Slovakia has a law requiring every monthly tax report concerning value added tax (VAT) to be submitted by electronic means and signed by a certified electronic signature. As many Slovak companies still don't have certified electronic signatures, the law enables an exception under which the company can enter into an agreement with the tax office and then use a special web-based application called “eDane”.</p>
		<p>However, the eDane application works only under the Windows operating system together with the Internet Explorer web browser. None of the other operating systems can run this application. As EURA Slovakia uses a competing operating system in the entire company and despite help from its IT staff, it was impossible for it to send anything electronically. When the company notified the tax administration about this problem, nothing happened. The company thus decided to fulfill its statutory obligations at least by submitting the tax reports in classical paper form. The tax office however, consider this to be contrary to the law.</p>

		<h2>Imposing the fines</h2>
<p>When the company pointed to the fact that it could not  electronically fulfill its obligation, it received 12 fines from the Slovak tax administration. <i>"We were really trying to respect the law, but in Slovakia there is no state-certified application that would support the electronic signature on the other operating system than Windows. We therefore had to enter into the agreement with the tax office and try to use the web-based application. Unfortunately, neither us, nor our technicians with years of experience, were able to run it,"</i> says the director of EURA Slovakia, Mr. František Slivka.</p>
<p>For submitting the tax report in the paper form, the company was fined several times, and so far wasn't successful with a single appeal before various administrative bodies. It has therefore decided to appeal to the court. <i>"Thousands of Slovak companies resigned on this behavior of the Slovak tax administration and simply bought a license to the Windows operating system only to be able to submit this monthly electronic reports. We believe that it is unfair. The administration thus directly forces Slovak companies to buy Windows, even though they do not need it for other purposes,"</i> says Slivka.</p>

 		<h2>European problem</h2>

<p><i>"If the state requires the electronic form as a only way of fulfilling the statutory obligation, it has to offer the multi-platform solution, which is available to everybody. Otherwise, the state in advance precludes its citizens to behave in accordance with the law,"</i> comments Martin Husovec, member of the FSFE Legal,  who assists the Slovak company in filling the case before the court. This problem is not unique for Slovakia.</p>
<p>Many companies in the other member states of the European Union have to deal with the very same problem. However, the Slovak case at hand is one of the most blatant and striking examples of the injustice in society caused by ignorance of the Open Standards in the digital world. It shows that the negligence of state in the field of open standards not only leads to the social injustice, but also hurts the competition, increases costs for the small companies and bureaucracy.</p>
<p>In its effect it also conflicts with European rules and recommendations, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Interoperability_Framework">European Interoperability Framework</a>, which clearly states that <i>"Member States setting up ICT-supported national public services need to be more aware of the risk of creating new electronic barriers if they opt for solutions that are not interoperable. Such so-called ebarriers fragment the internal market and hinder it from functioning properly. Member States and the Commission should step up their efforts to avoid this."</i></p>
<p>These new electronic barriers "digitally" handcuff the citizens and thus prevent them from behaving in accordance with the law. FSFE calls for a change in this practice.</p> 

		<h2>Litigation</h2>
<p>FSFE toghether with experts from <a href="http://eisionline.org/">European Information Society Institute (EISi)</a> assisted EURA Slovakia in its <a href="http://eisionline.org/index.php/projekty-m/sudy-a-obcianska-spolocnost-m/33-podnikatel-zaluje-stat">appeal</a> before the Regional Court in Banská Bystrica. Basic arguments used by claimant are that this behaviour of the Slovak tax authorities is in breach of local legislation on open standards, competition laws, principle of rule of law and basic right to engage in entrepreneurial activity. As a submission also argues that said behavior of state might be incompatible with art. 3(7) of Electronic Signatures Directive, we also request that Slovak courts makes preliminary reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union on whether it is compatible with this article of the directive to restric the use of electronic signatures in public sector to only one vendor.</p>
<p>Soon after the filing of the case, the Court attempted to proceduraly devide the case into 11 different and paralel cases. As this would pose extraordinary obstacles for the EURA Slovakia, FSFE toghether with EISi helped to file a compliant before the Constitutional Court of Slovak republic. The case will then continue before the Regional Court in Banská Bystrica.</p>
