	<h1>20 Years FSFE: Interviewing past interns</h1>

  <p>
    In the final publication about 20 Years FSFE, we want to thank 
    everyone who has worked for the organisation in an internship 
    position. We contacted eight former interns and asked them about 
    their time at the FSFE and their current involvement with Free 
    Software.

    These interviews are only a glimpse of the many people who have 
    helped shaping the FSFE with their contributions in an internship 
    position. <a href="/about/jobs/internship">An internship in the 
    FSFE</a> can be an intensive yet enriching experience. It 
    familiarises people with the use of Free Software and it helps them 
    networking with the Free Software community. We have asked eight of 
    our former interns about their time at the FSFE and how they are 
    doing today: Diego, George, Lucile, Ludmila, Martin, Matti, Polina, 
    Stian.

              From this internship I gained more insight into how the 
              Free Software community organises, how to organise 
              campaigns and workshops, and how to deal with <strong>legal 
              issues</strong> related to Free Software.

            <p>
              It was more about who the Free Software community was for 
              me. I got to know a great group of people from all over 
              the world. I won&#39;t forget that. Doing an internship 
              at the FSFE makes you more competent to <strong>tackle IT 
              collaboratively</strong>. And moreover the four software freedoms 
              (use, study, improve, and share) can be applied in all 
              walks of business. In this way, I have felt it was 
              fundamentally helpful.

            <p>
              During my internship I learned much about how Free 
              Software is made and used. I came for the policy and 
              political relevance to resist mass surveillance, and 
              learned much about technology and infrastructure. I 
              learned a lot about <strong>campaigning</strong> and 
              <strong>community organising</strong> during my 
              internship at the FSFE.

              My first conscious contact with Free Software was some 14 
              years ago. It was my second semester at uni and a friend 
              wouldn&#39;t stop bugging me to install Ubuntu on my 
              laptop, because it was, you know,  &quot;<strong>cool for 
              political reasons</strong>&quot;. At the end, we spent an evening 
              with the institute&#39;s Linux user group since back in 
              the day stuff mostly didn&#39;t just work and the <strong>sound 
              and wireless cards needed some extra persuasion</strong>. I 
              eventually stopped booting up the windows entirely and up 
              to this day cannot begin to fathom how one does software 
              development or network stuff on a windows machine. 
              (Although I&#39;ve heard, that&#39;s bettered in recent 
              years.)
            </p>
            <p>
              With time, I grew more aware about political issues 
              surrounding software and computers, about privacy, 
              security, re-usability and community. I then gradually 
              started <strong>advocating</strong> for the usage of Free Software myself 
              (because it was cool for political reasons), and was 
              hence delighted when the opportunity presented itself to 
              intern with the FSFE for a while. There, I got to know 
              some wonderful people and had the chance to do important 
              political work with like-minded folks.

              My internship at FSFE was a very pleasant experience. I 
              just came out of law school, hungry for some technology 
              law experience in Germany. And I landed in Berlin in 
              2011. What could go wrong? Intellectually, what stuck 
              with me the most was how differently Free Software 
              activists thought about the world of legal rules. For a 
              fresh graduate of law, rules were set by someone else. 
              TRIPS Agreement was an unchangeable fact. The 
              <strong>vocabulary</strong> was not a choice. Not for 
              these activists. Throughout my internship, I better 
              understood why and how <strong>concepts and labels drive 
              political outcomes.</strong> I learned to appreciate what 
              civil society does for legal change and how much work and 
              discipline this requires.

              To my surprise, the FSFE had much fewer staff members at 
              the Berlin office than I had expected. Yet, they have 
              done a lot for software freedom over the years. This 
              shows what <strong>dedication</strong> can achieve. A 
              good lesson for all of us.

              Free Software is so much more than a software licence or 
              publicly available source code. It is a <strong>social 
              movement</strong> and a community that strives for more 
              equal and just society. After completing my internship at 
              the FSFE, I continued my path in the FSFE as an employee, 
              leading its both legal and policy areas. My time in the 
              FSFE contributed immensely for my <strong>professional 
              and personal growth</strong>, setting my course on the 
              topics and areas I am involved in my current professional 
              environment outside of the FSFE i.e. EU digital policies 
              and regulation.

              My first and main task as an intern for the FSFE was to 
              organise FSCONS.  After my internship ended, I continued 
              being involved with the conference for <strong>eight more 
              years. </strong> The principles of Free Software 
              resonates with a lot of modern philosophy and can be 
              applied to almost anything. This has guided my life and 
              my personal philosophy since, especially the idea that 
              with cooperation and sharing, everyone will be better 
              off, than with competition and secrecy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following my internship, I started a Free Software 
              cooperative along with like minded friends, offering 
              consultancy and support for organisations that wish to 
              transition from proprietary software. While I like to 
              think that we did manage to achieve some good during the 
              four years the cooperative existed, we probably learned 
              more than anything about the many obstacles that remain 
              for Free Software to become ubiquitous. It became clear 
              that <strong>we need to promote Free Software on many 
              fronts, politically and practically</strong>, and how 
              vital organisations like the FSFE are to this.

              Free software is an every day topic for EDRi. On a 
              practical level, we use as much Free Software as we can 
              (operative systems, server applications, apps on our 
              phonesâ¦). Furthermore, <strong>we advocate for Free 
              Software</strong> whenever a European legislative file we follow 
              involves the use of software. We referred to the 
              public money, public code campaign in several occasions 
              and that framing is still an important part for EDRiâs 
              framing our technology and the role of public 
              infrastructures.

              Since I&#39;m a software developer, Free Software is an 
              important part of my day-to-day work â any 
              developer&#39;s job would look quite differently and be a 
              great deal more tedious if we weren&#39;t able to

              a hard-core expert on Free Software licensing, but I 
              continue to <strong>research</strong> many issues of the digital ecosystem

              At my department at the University of Gothenburg, we 
              <strong>publish all code, and most data, under a free 
              licence</strong>. Researchers in our field are usually 
              quite knowledgeable about Free Software, as we need to 
              know exactly what a program does to the data and be able 
              to share and improve it in order to reproduce and further 
              the research.

              Outside of work, my volunteering efforts are these days 
              limited to the democratic e-mail association Fripost.org. 
              It started out as a project of our local FSFE chapter ten 
              years ago, but has since evolved into its own 
              organisation. In addition to running an e-mail service 
              for our members, we have had many outreach programs and 
              community events centred around Free Software.

                I would love two things. First, I would love the FSFE 
                to go beyond software and <strong>embrace issues 
                related to hardware</strong>, infrastructure and 
                generally digital sovereignty. We need a European 
                federation that takes a holistic approach to how 
                technology should be a tool for fundamental rights, and 
                focusing only on software leaves out many of the 
                fundamental questions weâre facing today such as the 
                power of Big Tech, surveillance capitalism, mass 
                surveillance, surveillance-based advertising and 
                planned obsolescence of our devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, I would love the FSFE to become even more 
                involved in EU policies. For example, the FSFE has been 
                involved in issues related to artificial intelligence 
                where the FSFE expertise has been very valuable. We 
                need more of this knowledge-sharing between the FSFE 
                and EDRi and make more connections between Brussels and 
                FSFE chapters.

              The FSFE is inclusive and puts the learning perspective 
              at the heart of its mission. So I hope it thrives for 
              many years to come, inspiring people like it inspired me.

              I wish the FSFE to keep up the good work, keep spreading 
              the word of the advantages of Free Software, and <strong>keep 
              pushing for more just regulations</strong> on political level such 
              as the Public Money? Public Code! campaign.

              attracted to its vision. On many levels, <strong>we are 
              currently designing our digital future</strong>. Having 
              the FSFEâs voice when building its infrastructure, will 
              be critical.

              <strong>Keep advocating</strong> for software freedom especially at EU

            <p>
              I wish the FSFE to continue to be the voice of Free 
              Software users in Europe and beyond. Free Software stands 
              on the shoulders of all the great people being part of a 
              social movement that should not forget about its heroes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wish the FSFE to be strongly rooted in its beginnings 
              but at the same time to not be afraid of change and 
              developments of a fast-paced digital society. Free 
              Software has become a critical part of both business and 
              end-user experience in every day life. It is no longer an 
              âalternativeâ solution but a standard empowering our 
              society today.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, have we achieved a more just society as a result 
              of more wide-spread adoption of Free Software? <strong> 
              Is this the end-goal of the movement to retain the status 
              quo and not to bother about wider ethical issues? 
              </strong>Or should we as citizens and contributors of the 
              movement that rose out of a need for more freedom strive 
              for a better and more sustainable future, where Free 
              Software is just a part of a puzzle? I think we should be 
              asking ourselves these questions and seek answers that 
              may help us in bridging the gaps between Free Software 
              and how the âfour freedomsâ can support fundamental 
              rights. As a civil society actor, I hope the FSFE will be 
              in the lead here for many years to come, including on the 
              side of potential regulatory change in Europe.

               I wish for the FSFE to finally cease operations. That 
               is, to say â<strong>Our work here is done. All software 
               is now free. Letâs go celebrate!â</strong>

<h3>Thank you!</h3>

  <p>
    Thanks Diego, George, Lucile, Ludmila, Martin, Matti, Polina, 
    Stian, and all FSFE interns during these 20 years. Everyone who 
    uses and develops Free Software, everyone who researches and 
    advocates for Free-Software-related issues, everyone who donates 
    and volunteers in the FSFE, is irreplaceable and takes software 
    freedom a step further.
