            Free software and FSFE is to me: sharing, learning, being independent 
            of monopolies, producing things together, passion and freedom! Since 
            I've been a Fellow, I am finding new friends who help me in Free 
            Software and other topics, teaching new things every day even though we 
            are kilometers away. It is magnificent to be in a community that 
            continually supports my Free Software passion and motivation!
