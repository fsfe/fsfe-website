    <h1>Software Patents in Europe</h1>

<div id="introduction">

    <p>

      We are working towards a world where software does <em>what software
        users want it to do</em>. For this, software users must be able to
      participate in the development and distribution of the software.
      Software patents block this goal by adding <em>legal and financial
        risks</em> to software development and distribution and by giving the
      patent holders legal power to completely prohibit software developers
      from using the patented ideas.  
      
    </p>
</div>

    <p>
      To understand how patents work, it is important to realise that
      they have almost nothing in common with copyright.  While
      copyright is granted on the the work of an author, such as a
      computer program, patents are granted on ideas that could be
      used inside a computer program.  So when thinking of patents,
      think of "symphony combining wind and string instruments" and
      not "Beethoven's 2nd symphony." 
    </p>

    <h2 id="about">A problem for everybody</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Software patents add legal risks, and therefore costs, to software
      development.</li>

      <li>They specifically inhibit the development of useful software by
      blocking compatibility and interoperability.</li>

      <li>Patents are incompatible with software because software is
      so complex - too many ideas are used for it to be practical to
      count them and check them against existing patents</li>

    </ul> 

  <p><a href="http://en.swpat.org/wiki/All_businesses_are_targets">Software
    patents are a problem for everybody </a>, no matter if big or small
  companies, individual software developers, users, non-free or Free Software.
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>The <em>companies</em> have to spend more money for their legal department, to
    register patents, to negotiate patent crosslicensing, and to defend
    themselves against patent claims. While for some time software patents were
    a nice tool for big companies to prevent newcomers from competing with them,
    they also have to face companies who only sue others on software patents,
    and never do any software development by themselves. Against them, any
    software company can only loose.</li>

    <li>For <em>software developers</em> software patents mean legal
    uncertainty: whenever you start programming you might violate patent law. You will
    never be able to find out if you violate a patent. Even if you read a
    software patent you might not realise it covers what you are currently
    implementing.  With patents, we have to pay money to register them. On the
    other hand with copyright, everyone of us, even those who just program as a
    hobby, can write a program, and afterwards it will fall under copyright
    without any additional costs. In fact, software patents can dispossess us
    as they can prevent from using the rights we get from copyright, e.g. to
    distribute the program to others. </li>
    
    <li><em>Users</em> would have to pay for all those costs.  Some people
    estimate that the patent costs for smartphones are about 20% of the actual
    price payed by the customer. </li>

</ul>

    <h2 id="status">The current status</h2>

    <p>  The <a
      href="http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2013/e/ar52.html"> European Patent Convention states that software is not patentable</a>.
    But laws are always interpreted by courts, and in this case interpretations
    of the law differ. So the European Patents Office (EPO) grants software
    patents by declaring them as "computer implemented inventions". We will
    continue to work with our <a href="/about/fsfnetwork.html">sister
      organisations </a>, our <a href="http://www.ffii.org">associated
      organisation FFII</a>, and others to inform people about the dangers of
    software patents.  We will explain the legislative that they have to make
    the laws more precise so that the patent offices have to act as intended.
    We will continue to get rid of that problem. </p>
    
    <p>In the US our sister organisation is working to <a
      href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/software-patents-after-bilski">build
      awareness to the harm caused by software patents</a> and in New Zealand
    the government understood the problem and <a
      href="http://news.swpat.org/2010/03/new-zealand-govt-against-software-patents/">recommended
      in April 2010 to include computer programs amongst inventions that may not be
      patented</a>. </p>

    <li><p><strong><a href="/news/2013/news-20130612-01.html">German Parliament
        tells government to strictly limit patents on software</a></strong> On
    Friday the 7th of June the German Parliament decided upon a joint motion to
    limit software patents (see English translation by BIKT). The Parliament
    urges the German Government to take steps to limit the granting of patents
    on computer programs. Software should exclusively be covered by copyright,
    and the rights of the copyright holders should not be devalued by third
    parties' software patents.  The only exception where patents should be
    allowed are computer programs which replace a mechanical or electromagnetic
    component. In addition the Parliament made clear that governmental actions
    related to patents must never interfere with the legality of distributing
    Free Software.</p></li>

    all other laws lumped together by the term "<a
