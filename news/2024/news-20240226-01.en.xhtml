<h1>"I Love Free Software Day" 2024: Forging the future with Free Software</h1>

	
<p>
Together with hundreds of people and several organisations, we have 
celebrated another "I Love Free Software Day" on 14 February! On this 
day, we reached out to Free Software contributors to say Thank you! To 
all who joined us this time: Thank you for participating in this 14th 
edition of the "I Love Free Software Day" ❤️❤️❤️!
</p>

<p>
The "I Love Free Software Day" 2024 focused on younger generations and 
how to introduce them into the Free Software community. Therefore, several 
of our local groups celebrated this day with a meeting focused on 
younger people. The rest just focused on the main "I Love Free Software 
Day" idea: to acknowledge the amazing Free Software community, thanking 
Free Software projects and sharing their love for Free Software. And 
while several FSFE local groups - in Italy, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, 
England, Germany, and Switzerland - got together and celebrated their love 
for software freedom in person, we were happy to see how other other members 
of the Free Software community joined our call and 
organised meetings, like the one in Portugal.

<h3>I Love Free Software Day celebrations 2024</h3>

<p>
For this year the FSFE planned a special gift for several 
organisations and long-term volunteers to get them ready for 'I Love 
Free Software' day. We gave them an acrylglas heart and an LED strip, 
plus a microcontroller and some jump wires. The challenge? To tinker 
around with these things and to upload a picture of the heart on 14 
February. It turned out to be <a 
href="https://rwright.co/i-love-free-software-day">quite a 
challenge</a>, but a lot of fun!

	<p>
	For the celebrations in 2024, over a hundred people came together in <a 
	href="/activities/ilovefs/">13 local meetings</a> organised by either 
	FSFE local groups or other Free Software groups in seven different 
	countries. The celebrations were as different as the groups. The local 
	group in Aarhus, Denmark, organised a reading of the children's book <a 
	href="/activities/ada-zangemann/">"Ada &amp; Zangemann"</a>, while the 
	Portuguese organisation <a 
	href="https://esop.pt/destaque/esop-vai-participar-no-7o-debate-do-gt-pasc-democracia-cidadania-e-inclusao-social">esop 
	organised a translation</a> of this book into Portuguese.
