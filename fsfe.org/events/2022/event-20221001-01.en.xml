        <title>May REUSE be with you! in Barcelona, Spain</title>

    <body>
      <p>REUSE does not &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;. On the contrary, it integrates seamlessly into development processes and other best practices when indicating Free Software licences. In addition, there are tools and documentation to help you get started. During this talk Lina will take a closer look at these tools and documentation, with the bonus of seeing a live demonstration of how to make a project compliant with the REUSE specifications.</p>
      <p>Akademy will take place in a hybrid format. Lina will hold this talk in English and in person in Barcelona.  Akademy is free to attend however you need to register to reserve your space: https://akademy.kde.org/2022/register</p>
