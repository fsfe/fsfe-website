  Below is a side-by-side comparison of discussion draft 1 and
  discussion draft 2 of GNU GPL version 3.  Text that was in the first
  draft but which is not in the second draft is in <span
  style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">bold red</span> in the left
  column, and text which is new in the second draft is in <span
  style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">bold blue</span> in the right
  column.  The section numbers used in version 2 of the GNU GPL are
  shown in square brackets.

  Some <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">computers</span>  are designed to deny users

fundamentally incompatible with the purpose of the GPL, which is to

it covers will not be restricted in this way</span> .

access to install or run modified versions of the software inside

protect users' freedom to change the software <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">where changes are
possible</span>.  <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the
area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is
most unacceptable.</span>  Therefore,  <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">we have designed
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products</span>.
<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand
ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of
the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</span>

certain DVDs, it must be possible for modified versions to play those

possible for modified versions to communicate with the same online
service in the same way such that the service cannot distinguish.)  A
key need not be included in cases where use of the work normally implies
the user already has the key and can read and copy it, as in privacy
applications where users generate their own keys.  However, the fact
