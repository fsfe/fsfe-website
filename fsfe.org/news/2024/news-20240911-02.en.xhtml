<h1>Bring Back Free Software Funding: Give Your Feedback to the European Commission </h1>

<p>The European Commission has cut important funds for Free Software. 
The non-transparent decision shows the need for sustainable long-term 
funding to allow the EU to control its own technology. Raise your 
voice and  take part in an ongoing consultation to ask for sustainable 
long-term funds for software freedom. We explain why and how.</p>

<h3>Why should we care?</h3> 

<p>A few weeks ago the European Commission <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240719-01.html">made the decision to stop 
funding the Next Generation Internet initiative (NGI)</a> in its then 
current draft for the Horizon Europe 2025 Work Programme. This decision 
results in a loss of €27 million for software freedom. Since 2018, the 
European Commission has supported the Free Software ecosystem through 
NGI, that provided <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/index.html">funding 
and technical assistance to Free Software 
projects</a>. This decision unfortunately exposes a larger issue: that 
software freedom in the EU needs more stable, long-term financial 
support. The ease with which this funding was excluded from the Work 
Programme underlines this need.</p>

<p>Now you can ask for these funds and criticise the Commission's 
decision, by taking part in the ongoing consultation on the Digital 
Europe Programme. As the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative 
proved, public funding enables projects to innovate and promote a more 
open, independent, and accessible internet. Cutting funding for Free 
Software threatens to undermine this progress and push 
Europe away from policies that ensure people’s control over their own 
technology. That is why we demand that the €27 million for 2025 be brought 
back as well as demanding secured, sustainable long-term funding for Free 
Software.</p> 

<p>By <a 
href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13880-Digital-Europe-programme-interim-evaluation/public-consultation_en">participating 
in this consultation</a>, which <strong>closes on 20 September</strong> (midnight Brussels 
time) you can help to advocate for a digital future that puts users in 
control of  technology. Your input makes a difference.</p> 

<h3>How to Take Action</h3>

<div> <ol> <li>Participating is simple and it doesn’t take too long .
 Just <a 
 href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13880-Digital-Europe-programme-interim-evaluation/public-consultation_en">visit 
 the consultation page</a> and create an account. You only need a valid 
 e-mail address. This step is quick and easy.</li>

<li>Complete the survey: After signing up, you’ll be redirected to the 
survey. The process is relatively quick (~20 minutes) depending on 
which questions you consider most important and the level of detail. If 
you're unsure how to answer certain questions, you can skip those that 
aren't mandatory or draw inspiration <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/consultations/Digital%20Europe%20Programme%202024/DEP%20consultation%20FSFE.pdf">from 
our answers</a>. The key is to 
ensure that some of the arguments outlined below are included in the 
blank spaces.</li>

</ol>
<p>And that’s all :)</p>

<blockquote> 

<h3><strong>Ideas and key points to consider while 
submitting the consultation</strong>:</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Software is deeply involved 
in all aspects of our lives, and it is important that this technology 
empowers rather than restricts us. It gives everybody the rights to 
use, understand, adapt, and share software. In order to establish 
trustworthy systems, users must ensure they have full control over the 
software and the computer systems they are using. However, among the 
biggest challenges we still face today are vendor lock in and a lack 
of interoperability. This issue is particularly prevalent in public 
bodies, which often heavily rely on proprietary, closed source 
software.</li> 
<br/>
<li>We strongly advise prioritising the use and distribution of Free 
Software as well as providing financial support to relevant projects 
and the Free Software ecosystem. <strong>This support should be a sustainable 
long term fund</strong> for Software Freedom, focusing on independence, 
resilience, control, security, and sovereignty. A dedicated fund for 
Free Software would not only help governments to have better and more 
secure software, tailored to their needs, but also support the European 
IT market and the overall digital Europe.</li>
<br/>

<li>The Digital Europe Programme can only unfold its full potential 
if it is systematically focusing on the support of Free Software 
solutions. Otherwise, it risks continuing creating new dependencies and 
future lock-ins. By going in the direction of Free Software first, the 
EU can assure that taxpayers' money is spent in the most efficient 
way, while fostering the collaborative ecosystem  needed to achieve 
true  interoperability in Europe. An open and interoperable digital 
public sector is critical for addressing the social, economic, and 
political challenges faced by democratic governments.</li> 

</ul>

<p><strong>We’ve already participated. Now it’s your turn.</strong> Participating in the 
consultation with your own wording can be very valuable as it allows 
the European Commission to hear a diverse range of voices and 
perspectives, which strengthens our common argument for sustainable 
funding for Free Software while demonstrating that this demand comes from an 
engaged community. While you can use our answers as a reference, your 
own words will significantly bolster the case for why Free Software is 
essential for Europe’s digital future.</p>

<p>
Let’s make sure the European Commission hears us loud and clear. 
Together, we can bring back the funds for Free Software and safeguard 
the future of an open, transparent, and democratic internet. If you 
successfully submit a response to the consultation, please let us 
know via email: <email mailto="yes">contact@fsfe.org</email>.
