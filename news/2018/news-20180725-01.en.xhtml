<h1>"Public Money? Public Code!": more languages, more supporters, more awareness</h1>

<p>The "Public Money? Public Code!" campaign has 
received an updated set of translations, including the website, open 
letter and video. The Free Software Foundation Europe has also 
conducted interviews to ask public administrations about the benefits 
of public code, which are now available on our website.</p>

<p>Why is software, created using taxpayers' money, not released as Free 
Software? We've started raising this question with our <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">"Public Money? 
Public Code!"</a> campaign, and since then we've received a lot of international attention and support.</p>

<p>One key element for reaching out to as many people as possible is to 
have translations into their native language. That's why, as of today, 
<a href="https://publiccode.eu">our campain website</a> is translated in 
18 languages, spoken in Europe and beyond. The corresponding and popular 
campaign video is dubbed into 6 different languages (English, French, 
Italian, German, Portuguese and Russian) and offers subtitles in a 
total of 16 languages. If you haven't done yet, be sure to check 
whether your language is already supported!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an important part of the campaign is the corresponding <a 
href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">open letter</a>. Almost 18.000 
individuals and 150 organisations signed this letter, in which we 
demand that code, paid by the people, should be available to the 
people. Among the subscribers are very prominent Free Software and 
Internet user right's organisations, as well as a first public 
administration, the City Council of Barcelona. To understand the 
motivation behind the Council's decision, we conducted an <a 
href="/news/2018/news-20180705-01">interview with, 
Francesca Bria</a>, CTO of Barcelona, who explains how using Free 
Software helps to build a more democratic, inclusive and sustainable 
digital society.</p> 

<p>In another interesting interview, in relation to the PMPC campaign, 
we recently asked Elena Mu√±oz Salinero, who leads the Technology 
Transfer Centre of the Spanish Government, about best practices for the 
re-use of software solutions <a 
href="/news/2018/news-20180601-01.html">by publishing code under Free 
Software licenses</a> between public administrations.</p>

<p>We will keep running our call for signatures until the European 
Elections 2019, which is less than a year away. So, now is the time to 
take action and let your political representatives know about the 
benefits of public code. If you have not yet done so, please help us by 
signing our <a href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">open 
letter</a>. After having signed it, do ask your friends, colleagues, or 
the buddies on your favourite social media channel to sign it too. </p>
