      <p>AI and Free Software in the European Union</p>
      <p>The EU is on its way to adopting legislation on artificial intelligence. Transparency plays a major role in this. But how exactly should this transparency be designed and what role does Free Software play? The talk will give an insight into the current state of the debate and what chances there are that provisions for Free Software will be included in the legislation. The talk is in English, there is no need to register, and the event is free of charge.<br />
