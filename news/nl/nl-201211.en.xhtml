<h1>FSFE Newsletter - November 2012</h1>

<h2>Rooting and flashing your device does not void the warranty in EU</h2>

<p>Most of the participants in our <a href="/activities/android/android.html">Free Your Android</a>
workshops are concerned whether rooting your device (e.g. an
Android phone) and replacing its operating system with something else voids
your statutory warranty as consumer. We asked our legal coordinator
Matija Šuklje and FSFE legal council Carlo Piana to analyse the problem. <a
  href="http://matija.suklje.name/rooting-and-flashing-your-device-does-not-void-the-warranty-in-eu">Their
  answer is: No.</a> "Just the fact that you modified or changed the software
of your device, is not a sufficient reason to void your statutory warranty. As
long as you have bought the device as a consumer in the European Union." Read throughout
their <a
  href="http://matija.suklje.name/rooting-and-flashing-your-device-does-not-void-the-warranty-in-eu">
  analysis</a>.</p>

<p>We hope these news will encourage people to flash their devices with Free
Software. Next opportunity to attend on of our Free Your Android workshop is on
the 9th of November at <a href="/events/2012/fscons-2012.html">FSCONS</a>, in
Sweden, and on the 16th of November <a
  href="https://2012.sfscon.it/en/program">at SFSCON</a>, in Italy.</p>

<h2>Facts about software patents by the New York Times</h2>

<p>The New York Times published an article entitled <a
  href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/technology/patent-wars-among-tech-giants-can-stifle-competition.html">
  "The Patent, Used as a Sword"</a> about the patent system. Hugo Roy 
 <a href="
  http://blog.hugoroy.eu/2012/10/10/some-facts-about-the-us-patent-system/">summaries
  it</a>. It is about how Apple and Google were spending more on
patents than on research and development in 2011. Among other issues, it focuses on the number of lawsuits
filed each year in the US, which has tripled from 1990 to 2010, and how 70% of patent
applications are approved after the applicant altered claims.</p>

<p>On the same topic, Karsten Gerloff <a
  href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/gerloff/2012/09/27/epo-debate-how-software-patents-are-delaying-the-future/">gave
  a talk about "How Software Patents Are Delaying The Future"</a>, on a
discussion panel organised by the European Patent Office. "Currently, a lot of
policy on patents (as well as copyright) is made on the basis of faith and
rather dubious argument. We urgently need to move on towards evidence-based
policy making", concludes Karsten. </p>

<h2>Something completely different</h2>

<ul>

  <li>FSFE will <a href="/events/2012/fscons-2012.html">have a track focused
    on general purpose computing at FSCONS</a> in Gothenburg from 9th to 11th
  November. Karsten Gerloff will talk about <a
    href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/gerloff/2012/09/27/epo-debate-how-software-patents-are-delaying-the-future/">software
    patents</a>, Erik Albers about the <a
    href="/activities/android/android.html">Free Your Android campaign</a>, Sam
  Tuke will give a preview about a new campaign FSFE will launch soon, and your
  editor gives a general overview about general purpose computing. In other
  tracks, Otto Kekäläinen gives two talks, one about <a
    href="/news/2012/news-20121022-01.html">"Dirty tactics against LibreOffice
    in public administration and how to overcome them"</a> and another about
  "How to fix public procurement"; and Hugo Roy will present his project <a
    href="http://tos-dr.info/">"Terms of Services; Didn't Read"</a>. And there
  are <a href="https://fscons.org/2012/schedule/">other interesting talks</a>.

<h2>Get active: Every buck, fixes a bug!</h2>

<p>A lot of you already signed our <a
  href="/activities/pdfreaders/petition.html"> Petition For The Removal Of
  Proprietary Software Advertising On Public Institution Websites</a>, and now
we ask you for your support to enhance this campaign.</p>

<p>With the example of PDF readers we raised general awareness of proprietary
software advertisements on public administration's websites since September
2010. Until today our Petition was signed by 80 organisations, 58 businesses
and 2438 individuals. We contacted 2104 public administrations, and managed to
close 552 bugs (26%). So 552 federal government departments, municipalities,
and other administrations removed the advertisement, or added additional
references to Free Software PDF readers. And we will continue fixing the
remaining bugs. Just last month <a href="/news/2012/news-20120921-01.html">
  twenty Italian civil society organisations wrote a letter</a> to the
President of the Authority for the Protection of Personal Data, asking the
agency to ensure that all documents published on its website can be read and
used with Free Software programs.</p>

<p>However, we also received a lot of feedback from the public administration
and other institutions and political entities. One big task is to improve the
PDF readers  website, as it is one of our key tools in this campaign. With your
donation, we will be able to implement the planned new features for the website
until the 1st of February and after it, for its maintenance.</p>

<p>Please donate <a
  href="http://www.ulule.com/pdfreaders/">on the
  fundraising page</a>, which uses Ulule platform, and spread the news about
it. <strong>Update: Turn off Javascript before you follow the link to the donation page, to avoid running nonfree software</strong></p>
