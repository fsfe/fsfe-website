      <p>Digital technologies, and in particular information technologies, have become an integral part of our lives. With the spread of SARS-CoV-2, more people have adopted remote working methods and have become aware of the necessity of knowledge transmission through social technologies. Schools, universities, and all institutions in the education sector are no exception. Teachers, parents, and students are among the first to have experienced the effects of the increasing need to use information tech.</p>

<p>In this talk, Francesco Bonanno and Giuseppe Lipari will discuss the fundamental role of Free Software in today's education system. This talk will take place on the 25th October, at 16:00 (CEST), no registration needed.</p>
