      Freedom is one of the core values of our Society and one of the basic
      concepts of Democracy. Supporting and spreading Free Software is one way
      to build creative alternatives for social inclusion and to protect our
      citizens from the digital exploitation. We are responsible to build a
      better World as a gift for our future generations.
