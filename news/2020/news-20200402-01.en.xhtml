<h1>Why using Free Software for remote working and what?</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">Due to the ongoing Covid-19 virus outbreak many employers - voluntarily or mandatory - are working remotely now. Many organisations who have not been used to remote working so far now face a number of difficulties adapting to the situation. To avoid potential lock-ins, some FSFE supporters collectively wrote about the good reasons to use Free Software for remote working and collected a detailed list of practical solutions <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/FreeSoftware4RemoteWorking">in our wiki</a>.</p> 

<p>Because of the ongoing Covid-19 virus outbreak many organisations who never previously directed any strategic thought towards the available solutions for remote working in their business now opt for a quick solution and choose to follow the - in the beginning often free of charge - offerings from big tech companies and their proprietary solutions. However, <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2020/news-20200330-01.html">such proprietary solutions lock-in these organisations in the future</a>.</p> 

<p>However, such lock-in is unnecessary, since most proprietary solutions are just simple replacements of good Free Software solutions that offer a similar or even better level of functionality. And the best: choosing a Free Software solution means to opt for a solution that has a future, where your organization no longer depends on a particular vendor or file format or whichever other means those vendors choose to lock you in. Free Software puts you in control. </p>

<p>To help you getting started or digging deeper into using Free Software for collaboratively and remote working some FSFE supporters worked on a detailed list of qualitative Free Software solutions for different purposes and <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/FreeSoftware4RemoteWorking">published the outcome in our wiki</a>. Find inspiration for your work environment or add your own solution.</p>

<h3>Why Using Free Software For Remote Working</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Never be locked in again:</strong> Especially if your organisation is considering to offer remote working after the Covid-19 period you better avoid any potential lock-in to particular and proprietary software or formats right now from the start. </li>
		<li><strong>Self-host now or later:</strong> If your organisation needs a quick solution now and chooses to use software as a service but possibly likes to switch later to self-host a good solution on your own server and infrastructure, then Free Software solutions are the only choice.</li>
		<li><strong>Advanced privacy:</strong> Usually, Free Software solutions do not follow a data-driven revenue model. This means that your data usually stays in your hands when using Free Software.</li>
		<li><strong>Enjoy competition:</strong> When you build up Free Software solutions you can choose among different providers to help you with the implementation. When you get in trouble with one of them - on legal, personal or other matters - you can simply choose another provider that offers a similar service or even directly takes over the maintenance of your existing infrastructure.</li>
		<li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> When using Free Software you build on future-proven technologies due to their open licensing regime, open formats and open documentation. No more "end of support" or "end of lifetime". You can use and re-use any solution as long as you want.</li>
		<li><strong>Global availability:</strong> No matter the jurisdiction you are in, you are always legally safe to use your software solutions when it is Free Software.</li>
		<li><strong>Go with the standards:</strong> Only open formats can set true industry standards because any proprietary format by nature is an isolated solution. Open formats instead are the backbone of interoperability between different services.</li>
		<li><strong>Localisations and diversity:</strong> Free Software solutions and protocols very often offer more than one client or implementation. That allows your members, employees or customers to choose for themselves how to connect remotely. Also, Free Software often has more localization and languages available, which can be of big help if you are an international organization.</li>
		<li><strong>Do it yourself:</strong> Set up your own local infrastructure whenever you are ready and chose the same software everyone is already used to. Enjoy help and knowledge sharing culture in vibrant communities.</li>
