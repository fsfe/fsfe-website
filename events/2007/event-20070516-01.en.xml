    <body>
      On Wednesday the 16th of may, the FSFE and Göteborg University, Sweden,
      invites you to attend a lecture by Richard Stallman on
      Free Software and Beyond: Human Rights in the Use of Software and
      Other Published Works. Stallman will speak about the history and
      philosophy of the Free Software Movement, address how the ideas of Free
      Software do or don't extend to other kinds of published
      works and explain what the Pirate Party must change in its program
      to avoid unintended negative consequences in the software field.
