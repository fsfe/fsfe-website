<h1>Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA)</h1>

<h3>What is the FLA?</h3>

<p>The Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA) is a copyright assignment that allows
one entity to safeguard all of the code created for a project by consolidating
copyright (or exclusive exploitation rights) to counteract copyright
fragmentation.</p>

<p>This enables projects to protect their legal maintainability by preserving
the ability to relicense code and ensuring sufficient rights to enforce
licences in court. The person assigning does not lose their rights to the
code either, as the FLA gives back unlimited usage/single exploitation rights
to the author. The FLA also applies a set of principles for the fiduciary.
If they breach these principles, all grants and licenses made to them
automatically expire.</p>

<p>Benefeciaries of the FLA assign the copyright in their work, and in 
countries where assignments of the copyright in a work are impossible, 
they grant the fiduciary an exclusive license (see ยง1(1) for details). 
Therefore, the FLA is designed to work in both civil and common law countries.</p>

<p>The FLA is used for FSFE's <a href="fiduciary.html">Fiduciary Programme</a>.
It can also be adapted to assign the rights to any other third party.</p>
