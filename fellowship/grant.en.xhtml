    <h1>Fellowship Grant</h1>

    <div id="introduction">

    <p>The Fellowship grant is a way for people involved in
    Free Software activism to become Fellows, even if they
    cannot afford the Fellowship donation.</p>

    </div>

  <p>Despite financial constraints many people in the Free Software community
  devote a great deal of their time to Free Software activities.  For example
  programming, translating, administrating, organising events, giving talks or
  advocating Free Software principles at public events. FSFE has now found a
  way to recognise their efforts and let them become part of the
  Fellowship.</p>
	
  <p>The grants will be awarded upon evaluation of individual candidacies and
  will provide a one-year Fellowship subscription. Each month, FSFE will select
  three candidates and announce the decisions at the beginning of the following
  month.</p>

	<h2>Who can apply</h2>

	<p>Anyone who:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Shares the Fellowship and Free Software principles</li>
		<li>Is active in the diffusion, development and improvement of Free Software</li>
		<li>Cannot afford the Fellowship contribution</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How to apply for a Fellowship grant</h2>
	
  <p>To apply for the grant is very easy: Write an e-mail to <a
    href="mailto:fellowship@fsfeurope.org">fellowship (at) fsfeurope (dot)
    org</a>, where you introduce yourself, explain the reasons why you would
  like to join the Fellowship, and what you have been doing in the past to
  support Free Software.</p>

  <h2>Who made it possible</h2>
        
  <p>The Fellowship grant has only been possible thanks to <a
    href="/donate/thankgnus.html">FSFE's supporters</a>. In particular, a
  generous donation from tarent GmbH, finally enabled FSFE to offer the
  Fellowship grant. Elmar Geese, CEO at tarent GmbH says:</p>
  
  <blockquote><p>"We grew closer to the Fellowship of FSFE since some of our
    employees are already Fellows. We know that being a Fellow is a great way
    to become involved with FSFE and make a real difference for Free Software.
    We are glad that our contribution will allow other enthusiastic people to
    become part of the
    Fellowship."</p></blockquote>
