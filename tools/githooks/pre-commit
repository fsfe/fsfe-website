  === SYNTAX ERROR ===
  One or more files failed the XML syntax check!

  The error log above will help you to identify the error. Read it from
  the top. The numbers behind the file name point to the line number in
  the file where the error has been detected.

  Check this line and its surroundings for XML/HTML tags that have not 
  been closed correctly, errors with special characters like "&", or
  other syntactical mistakes.

  The commit has been aborted. You have to fix the problem first.

  Your commit introduced $NEWTAGS tag(s) which did not exist before in
  our news or event items!
  $(echo $FILES | sed -E -e "s/\|/\n  - /g")

  Please make sure that you use already used tags, and only introduce a
  new tag e.g. if it's about a new campaign that will be more often
  mentioned in news or events. If you feel unsure, please ask
  <web@lists.fsfe.org>.

  Here you will find the currently used tags:
  https://fsfe.org/tags/tags.html

  Your commit has been executed anyway. Please make another commit to
  replace a new tag with an already existing one unless you are really
  sure. Thank you.
