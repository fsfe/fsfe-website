<h1>LLW 2025, “unperfect” discussions around Free Software in a legal environment</h1>

<p>The Free Software
Legal &amp; Licensing Workshop convened once again, this time in Essen, 
bringing together over 100 legal and compliance
professionals, technologists, and policy experts from across the globe.
The 2025 edition delved into the evolving
legal landscapes impacting Free Software, with a particular focus on
Artificial Intelligence and cybersecurity.</p>

<p>The <a href="/activities/ln/llw.html">FSFE’s Free
Software Legal &amp; Licensing Workshop (LLW)</a>, is a a two and a half
day conference for members of the <a
href="activities/ln.html/">Legal Network community</a> to
meet face-to-face and share legal expertise. Once again, this conference
emphasized the importance of fostering a collaborative environment where
professionals can share insights, debate complex issues, and build a
cohesive understanding of the legal landscape affecting Free
Software.​</p>
<p>Set in the creative and collaborative atmosphere of <a
href="https://www.uph.de/">Unperfekthaus</a>, a vibrant cultural hub in
the heart of Essen (Germany), participants engaged in in-depth discussions on
current topics in the Free Software sphere. These conversations extended
beyond traditional legal and licensing concerns to include the broader
policy landscape, where emerging regulations increasingly shape the way
Free Software is developed, distributed, and maintained. </p>
<p>For instance, the intersection between law and policy proved
especially relevant in sessions addressing pressing issues such as <a href="/activities/dma/dma.html">the
EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>, <a href="/news/2024/news-20240715-01.html">the EU Cyber Resilience Act
(CRA)</a> and the licensing of AI technologies.</p>

<p>Participants discussed the impact of interoperability policies
imposed by large corporations like Apple on smaller Free Software
developers and how this relates to the <a
href="/activities/apple-litigation/">litigation</a>
efforts conducted by the FSFE.</p>

<p>With the CRA being one of the most impactful laws on Free Software
these days, there were also several discussions dedicated to
understanding compliance,legal enforcement, and further policy
development of the law. </p>

<p>Topics concerning export control, licensing for hardware and
software, tools for compliance automation and community governance were
also debated in detail. </p>

<p>AI remains a topic of interest, and the participants engaged in
discussion related to the definition of Free Software AI, the relevance
of data for licensing, as well as challenges for the enforcement of the
AI Act.</p>

<p>Continuing its commitment to nurturing emerging legal talent, this
year the LLW also organized a mentorship program, which started with a
breakfast meetup before the official kick off of the conference, so that
experienced legal professionals acting as mentors were able to meet with
newcomers to the industry and the conference in an informal environment,
before the talks stated. The mentorship program is aimed at new members
of the Legal Network.</p>

<p>Feedback from attendees was positive, with many highlighting the
value of face-to-face interactions and the depth of knowledge shared
during the sessions. One participant noted, "The LLW remains an
unparalleled forum for tackling the pressing legal questions of our time
in the Free Software domain."​</p>

<p>The FSFE extends its gratitude to all participants and sponsors,
whose support made LLW 2025 possible: Red Hat, Amazon, Microsoft,
Siemens Bosch, Ericsson, GitHub, Intel, Eclipse Foundation Heuking,
Liferay, Open Invention Network, and The Linux Foundation.</p>


<h3 id="the-legal-network"><span id="anchor-10"></span>The Legal
Network</h3>
<p><a href="/activities/ln/index.html">The Legal
Network</a> is a neutral, non-partisan group of experts in different
fields involved in Free Software legal issues. Currently the Legal
Network has over 400 participants from different legal systems, academic
backgrounds and affiliations. </p>
<p>The aim of the Legal Network is to promote discussion and foster
better knowledge of the legal constructs that back Free Software. The
conversations on the Legal Network are intended to be dynamic,
thought-provoking, and up to speed with the most recent developments.
</p>
<p>The Legal Network serves as an open platform to promote legal
knowledge about Free Software so that companies can make strategic
decisions about Free Software development based on an understanding of
how Free Software licensing and other related legal issues work. This
allows Free Software developers and legal professionals who work within
larger companies to continue to contribute to software freedom. </p>
<p><a href="/activities/ln/application.html">Admission to
the Legal Network</a> is restricted, and the discussions held there are
confidential. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the content of the
mailing list is contained away from the larger Free Software community.
The <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule">Chatham
House Rule</a> applies to all discussions on the Legal Network mailing
list and at Legal Network events, which enables members to use the
information received, but not to reveal the identity nor the affiliation
of the speaker or any of the participants involved in the discussion.
