        Free Software Foundation Europe is dedicated to the
        furthering of Free Software.  Access to software determines who
        may participate in a digital society, therefore we believe <a
        href="/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html">the freedoms to
        use, copy, modify and redistribute software</a> are
        essential in the information age.
