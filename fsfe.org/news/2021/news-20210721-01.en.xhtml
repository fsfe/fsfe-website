<h1>FSFE: 20 years of empowering people to control technology</h1>

  <p>
    Marking twenty years of the FSFE, we highlight the importance of 
    software freedom in Europe and important 
    accomplishments since 2001. We shed light on our community with a 
    birthday page where you can find community interviews and videos. 
    People are invited to celebrate with us and share their own 
    stories.
  </p>

  <p>
	Long before the first smartphone was introduced, it was evident to
	the FSFE's founders that it is the people who should be in 
	control of technology and not vice versa. In 2001, Free Software 
	experts around Europe therefore <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2001q2/000003.html">created</a> 
	the Free Software Foundation Europe. 20 years later, we successfully 
	concentrate our daily work on <a href="/about/ourwork.html">three main 
	pillars</a> to help software freedom thrive in Europe: public 
	awareness, policy advocacy, and legal support.

<h2>Some highlights of the last 20 years</h2>

  <p>
	In 2021, the FSFE looks back on a successful history with 
	major successes in the public, legal, and policy fields. For example 
	in 2005, when our intense <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2004q2/000057.html">campaigning</a> 
	and collaboration with other organisations persuaded the European 
	Parliament to <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2005q3/000109.html">vote</a> 
	against Software Patents. Or two years later, when the European 
	Court of Justice aligned with the FSFE, <a href="/activities/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.html">requiring 
	Microsoft to publish interoperability information</a>. During that 
	time, we saw that it was needed to help Free Software developers by 
	clarifying the legal aspects of their work, such as the enforcement 
	in case of license violations. This led to the FSFE starting to 
	work with Free Software legal advocates and practitioners for legal 
	initiatives in 2006.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, the FSFE facilitates <a href="/activities/ftf/ln.html">the world's 
	largest professional network on legal issues related to Free 
	Software</a>, by providing an online platform as well as in-person events for network members to discuss and share information on licensing issues and best practices. In 2017, we also 
	created the highly successful <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> initiative to provide a 
	set of recommendations that make licensing Free Software projects 
	easier for developers. REUSE has been adopted by well known 
	projects such as the German Corona Warn App and the KDE.
  </p>
  <p>
	Since its founding, the FSFE has been committed to running public 
	campaigns and helping people to understand the benefits of Free 
	Software. As early as 2012, we helped users to overcome software 
	restrictions in their phones with the launch of our <a href="/activities/android/">'Free Your 
	Android' campaign</a>. Two years earlier we introduced <a href="/activities/ilovefs/index.html">"I Love Free Software Day"</a> which is celebrated around the 
	globe every year on 14 February. In 2017, we launched the 
	extraordinarily successful <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">'Public Money? Public Code!' 
	campaign</a>, convincing several public administrations to change 
	their IT strategy. The accompanying  <a href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">open letter</a> has been signed 
	by over 200 civil society organisations, 31.000 individuals, and 
	several public administrations like the city of Barcelona and the 
	Swedish JobTech Development center.

    <h2>FSFE20 campaign: handing over the mic to our community</h2>

   
   <p>
    Of course, all these accomplishments can only give a glimpse of the 
    impact of the FSFE and our activities in the last 20 years. They do not tell how all these successes are the result of our 
    large community that we can rely on. To at least shed light on some 
    of them we created the <a href="/activities/20years/20years.html">FSFE20 campaign</a>
    this year, where we hand over the mic to our community.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have contacted people who paved the way of the FSFE since its beginning, 
    such as long term contributors and past staffers. In a series of 
    interviews we discuss the progress of the FSFE as well as 
    technological topics. Every person who is involved in the FSFE has 
    unique memories, expertise, and hopes for the future. They are all part 
    of the story of 20 Years FSFE.

  <p>
	So far we interviewed <a href="/news/2021/news-20210204-01.html">Georg 
	Greve</a>, founder president of the FSFE; <a href="/news/2021/news-20210305-01.html">Reinhard 
	MÃ¼ller</a>, long-term volunteer and former Financial Officer of the 
	FSFE; <a href="/news/2021/news-20210420-01.html">Fernanda 
	Weiden</a>, former Vice President of FSFE and founding member of 
	FSF Latin America; and <a href="/news/2021/news-20210625-01.html">Torsten 
	Grote</a>, Free Software developer and long time volunteer in the 
	FSFE.
  </p>

  <p>
	And this is just the beginning. We will conduct several more 
	interviews to shed light on 20 Years FSFE. In addition,  this autumn we want to publish another dedicated birthday page whose content is entirely made from our community contributions.
  You will find more on this and the interviews on our <a href="/activities/20years/20years.html">birthday 
	page</a>! Besides these interviews, you will also find a birthday 
	video from science-fiction author Cory Doctorow and one by our 
	current president Matthias Kirschner alongside information on 
	how people can join the celebrations.

message to you from our President Matthias Kirschner</h3>
  
    <p>
        Although technology is ever-changing, our values have been 
        consistent throughout the last twenty years. The core of our work 
        is, in a nutshell: educating people on the nature of Free Software, 
        highlighting its political implications, and simplifying its legal 
        preconditions. Matthias Kirschner, President of the FSFE since 
        2015, explains this in his own words in a short video.
