We see ourselves as Europeans with a different cultural background but with the common vision of an infrastructure built on Free Software - as a precondition of a Free Society. This is what makes us strong. We believe in cooperation from a regional to a global level, from community to an organisational level, from freedom to liberty. You are welcome to join our community!
