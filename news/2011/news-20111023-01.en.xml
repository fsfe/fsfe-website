    <body>
      <p>
      Rikard Fröberg works at the The Society for Free Culture and Software, and
      contributes this year to the FSCONS organisation for the third time.
      In the October Internship Interview he considers the importance of having an
      active and engaged community of users, which, thanks to events like FSCONS, have
      the opportunity of direct interaction.
