<h1>#ilovefs Report 2014</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">On February 14th, people all around the world expressed 
their gratitude and appreciation not only to their partner but also to Free 
Software and its contributors. With our yearly #ilovefs we asked you to 
thank your favourite developers and projects and were overwhelmed by the 
resonance in <a href="#id-more-blog-posts">blogs</a>, <a href=
"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ilovefs">social networks</a>, and mailing 
lists.</p>

<p>Developers and contributors of Free Software projects work hard to ensure 
our freedom and on this day surely many of them gained new motivation. Thank 
you for participating in this year's #ilovefs campaign and enjoy some of the 
many love declarations we collected:</p>

<p>Adrienne sees Free Software as an important part of her life and explains 
why <a href="http://cracktheplates.com/2014/02/i-love-free-software/
">even little steps in using Free Software are meaningful</a>:</p> 
<blockquote><p>I use it because it is written by people who care deeply 
about what they do, and who want to keep improving. It reminds me of the 
Hebrew phrase <em>tikkun olam</em>, which means repairing (or healing) the 
world. Free Software means you can read the code, which means you can 
improve it — and then pass it on for the better. Free Software repairs the 
world by advancing projects made with integrity to people who need them, 
free of charge. One day, I hope to contribute code to projects that people 
use every day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tamara was an intern in a local hacklab and says that <a href=
"http://tamaraatanasoska.wordpress.com/2014/02/14/i-love-free-software/">
knowing and teaching the ideology and message of Free Software is 
crucial</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is really important is that they, while teaching me the 
purely technical stuff about Linux and helping me with programming, were 
insisting that I know and get familiar with the ideology and what stands 
behind Free Software, and why is it crucial to us. They gave me 
documentaries to watch, they talked, shared, repeated. And I thank them. I 
am a better person and hacker and have made friends for life.</p></blockquote>

<p>For Anna, Free Software is especially interesting when <a href=
"http://www.phplist.com/?lid=635">mixed with other aspects of an open society
</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, February the 14th, is an international celebration of 
our love... for Free Software! People love it for all sorts of reasons, but 
for me, it's about the creative freedom that Free Software brings, with new 
software and new skills just a sudo yum install away. I feel especially 
blessed when Free Software meets Open Culture; then the party really gets 
started! </p></blockquote>


<h3>#ilovefs is crossing borders</h3>

<div class="captioned left" style="max-width: 650px; width: 40%;">
<img src="/news/2014/graphics/ilovefs-german-green.jpg" alt="German green 
parliamentary group with an ilovefs picture" width="100%" />
</div>

<p>One speciality of #ilovefs is the broadband of people expressing their 
love for Free Software. Year after year we recognise that Free Software is 
not only a topic for programmers and professional users but for many groups 
of people: the average computer users, artists, journalists, companies, and 
among them also politicians. This year the parliamentary group of the Green 
party in Germany <a href="http://gruen-digital.de/2014/02/we-free-software/">
wrote how important Free Software is in times of global surveillance and in 
general</a>. And as a small extra they also sent a picture expressing their 
appreciation for the Free Software community, among them Katrin 
Göring-Eckardt, Toni Hofreiter, Britta Haßelmann, Claudia Roth, Jan Phillip 
Albrecht, Hans-Christian Stöbele, and Konstantin von Notz.</p>

Free Software" width="100%" /></a>
</div>


<p>There were also several events which focussed on "I Love Free Software 
Day". In Manchester, <a href= 
"http://freeasinfreedom.org.uk/what-we-did-becase-we-love-free-software/"> 
Free Software was even celebrated with a week-long festival</a> full of 
workshops about Bitcoin, encryption, Wordpress and Free Your Android. Anna 
and the other volunteers had a very busy week with co-organising it but it 
was worth it: More than 100 people were learning, teaching and having fun 
with Free Software!</p>

<h3>Media coverage</h3>
