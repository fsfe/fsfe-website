    <title>Software patents detrimental to European power supply business</title>
    <body>
      If the software patent directive is adopted in its current form, it would
      be possible to apply for a software patent on the so-called "control of
      cascade" -- regardless of whether the patentee has implemented a solution
      to the idea or not. Anyone who has a solution to implement this idea
      needs the permission of the patent holder, which the patent holder is
      able to give or refuse.
