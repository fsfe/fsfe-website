Statement at Inter-Sessional, Inter-Governmental Meeting (IIM), 11-13
April 2005: "We explicitly support the Friends of Development in their

 therefore be beyond review. [...] Essential building blocks of human
 creativity, such as access to knowledge and freedom to participate in
 society and economy should once again become the norm, not the
 exception. [...]"
