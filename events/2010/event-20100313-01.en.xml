      FSFE will have a booth at “LinuxTage”, one of the most important
      event about Free Software in Germany.  As in the last years a
      ticket for the conference will cost € 5.  Reduced fee will be € 3.
      Tickets are valid on both days and can be bought directly at the
      entrance to the conference.  A reservation is neither necessary
      nor possible.  A ticket pre-sale is also not planned.  The event
      takes place at Hörsaal- und Seminar-Gebäude der Technischen
      Universität Chemnitz, Reichenhainer Straße 90, 09126 Chemnitz.
