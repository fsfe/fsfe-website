      <h2>Documents of the FSF Europe for the 6th Framework
      Programme</h2>

      <p>The European Union has launched its <a
	href="http://www.cordis.lu/rtd2002/fp-debate/fp.htm">6th
	Framework Program for research and development</a>, that will
	cover Europe's funded reasearch for the period 2002-2006.</p>

      <p>The commission issued a <a
      href="http://www.cordis.lu/fp6/eoi-instruments/home.html">call
      for expressions of interest</a> (EOI.FP6.2002), asking for
      interested parties to submit proposals for the use of the new
      instruments (Integrated Projects and Networks of Excellence) for
      the Thematic Priorities.</p>

      <p>The FSF Europe has undertaken several tasks in order to
      integrate Free Software as a key element of the European Union's
      reasearch and development funding policy, in response to this
      definition process:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>April 30th, 2002 : a <b><a
	  href="recommendation.en.html">general recommendation by the
	  FSF Europe and supporting parties for the 6th European
	  Community Framework Programme</a></b>: "<i>Free Software is a
	  concept that has fundamentally changed the way some parts of
	  the IT sector are working towards a more stable, lasting and
	  sustainable approach with higher dynamics and increased
	  efficiency. It is obvious that the first region to adopt and
	  support this principle on a larger scale can profit
	  enormously and get a head-start in the information
	  age.</i>"</li>

	<li>June 4th, 2002 : two formal Expressions of Interest to the
	  Commission's call (EOI.FP6.2002):
	  <ul>
	    <li><b>FOCAL: "FOcusing Competence for Advantages of
	    Liberty"</b>, a proposal for a Network of Excellence (<a
	    href="focal.en.html">HTML</a> - <a
	    href="FOCAL.pdf">PDF</a>)</li>

	    <li><b>LAFIS : "LAying the Foundations for Information
	    Society"</b>, a proposal for an Integrated Project (<a
	    href="lafis.en.html">HTML</a> - <a
	    href="LAFIS.pdf">PDF</a>)</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>
