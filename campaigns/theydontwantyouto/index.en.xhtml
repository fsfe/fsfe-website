		<p>How much more are you prepared to take? Every day new ways of restricting citizens are developed, bought and sold. It's time for us to take a stand, and refuse to comply with what they don't want us to do.</p>
		
		<ul class="overview">

				<h3><a href="http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fintent%2Ftweet%3F%20related%3Dfsfe%20%26text%3DWhat%20digital%20restrictions%20have%20you%20faced%20lately%3F%20%26url%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Ftheydontwantyou.to%20%26via%3DTheyDontWant%20%26hashtags%3DTheyDontWant">What restrictions won't you stand for?</a></h3>
				<p>Products and services are now so frequently locked down that it's easy to accept the problems that they cause. Share examples of how they've made your life difficult; don't stand for it!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3><a href="">Take the message to the streets</a></h3>
				<p>Retailers and advertisers know that they lock down their products, and they work hard to ensure that prospective customers don't find out. Use these stickers to expose their secrecy and state the facts where it matters.</p>
