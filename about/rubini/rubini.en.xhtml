    <h1>Alessandro Rubini</h1>

    <p>Alessandro is an electronic engineer and holds a Ph.D. in computer
    science. He installed Linux 0.99.14, is an active Free Software user and
    developer, and author of the book "Linux Device Drivers". After his Ph.D.
    he left the university as he did not want to just write articles. He now
    works as an independent consultant in the area of industrial use of
    GNU/Linux, mainly on device drivers and embedded system as well as on
    microcontrollers and PCB design. Recently he has been working with CERN
    within the White Rabbit project, aimed at sub-nanosecond synchronisation of
    I/O cards. He enjoys working with CERN, as they have a policy to publish
    all their work as Free Software and Free Hardware.</p>

    <p>He was already a member of the Free Software Foundation Europe from 2001
    to 2006 and recently joined FSFE again. He felt that FSFE is the right
    place to have positive and constructive discussions about Free Software.
    Beside his volunteer engagement in FSFE and in other Free Software
    organisations, he is an active boy scout, likes cycling, is father of two
    children, and listens to white noise during work.</p>
