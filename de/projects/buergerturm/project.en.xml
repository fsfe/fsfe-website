    <title>Der Bürgerturm ("Citizen's Tower")</title>
    <description>
     The "Bürgerturm" was the vision of a building by the people
     for the people in real an virtual space, based upon and rooted
     in the principles of Free Software. The FSF Europe was involved
     in the first steps of the project and although the vision didn't
     come true, it might still be of interest and something that someone
     might pick up again in the future.
