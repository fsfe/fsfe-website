        Software design is crucial for the ecodesign and sustainability of
        products and hardware. Free Software systems and services enable reuse,
        repurposing and interoperability of devices. The universal right to
        freely choose operating systems, software and services is crucial for a
        more sustainable digital society.

    <p>
      The ongoing digitization of infrastructures and services comes along with
      a continuously growing number of electronic devices that are connected to
      the Internet - be it in private, public or business environments. Many of
      these devices need more energy and natural resources to be produced than
      the energy they consume during their entire lifespan. And way too many of
      these devices are being wasted and not reparable simply because the
      software stops working or is not being updated anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the pre-installed software stops users from continuing to use their
      hardware, restrictive ownership models prevent users from helping
      themselves to enjoy longer use of their devices. Restrictions span from
      physically locking down hardware, to technical obscurity by using
      proprietary software, to legal restrictions via software licenses and end
      user license agreements. This way, manufacturers often prohibit
      repairability, access and reuse of their devices. Even after purchase,
      customers often do not really own their devices. They are not able to do
      what they want with their very own devices.
      <strong
        >If you cannot install the software you want on your own device – you
        don’t own it.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <p>We, the signees of this open letter,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        recognize that free access to the hardware and software determines how
        long or how often a device can be used or reused.
      </li>
      <li>
        declare the increased longevity and reusability of our devices to be
        inevitable for a more sustainable digital society.

    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong
        >That is why we ask legislators in the European Union to make use of the
        historic chance and enable a more sustainable use of electronic products
        and devices with a universal right to install and run any software on

          Our tablets, phones and other connected devices are general purpose
          computers. Replacing software and operating systems on these devices
          enables us to extend the initial lifespan of a device and to make full
          use of our hardware. For the ability to reuse and repurpose our
          resources in a creative and sustainable way we need

          Users must have the free choice of providers offering software related
          services, meaning they can use the device from one manufacturer with
          the service provided by another. Many connected clients today go to
          waste simply because their online services go offline. Free choice of
          services allows these clients to be reused by connecting to another
          service.

        <p>
          Operating systems and embedded software determine possible
          interactions between generic sensors, modules and systems with their
          connected online services. For users to exercise free choice of
          services, they must be able to use the device from one manufacturer
          with any online service, which could be supplied by any other third
          party or by themselves.

          Software designs and architectures determine accessibility and
          compatibility of hardware via standards, drivers, tools, and
          interfaces. Proprietary software and protocols hinder competition
          among manufacturers, undermine repairability of devices and create an
          artificial incompatibility of different devices within the same
          infrastructure. Interoperability of single devices however is crucial
          for the creation of sufficient, sustainable and long-lasting IT
          infrastructures. To enable interoperability,
          <strong
            >manufacturers must ensure that any data necessary to run a

          Smaller components of a device often require specific drivers, tools,
          and interfaces to operate. Users need full access and free reusability
          of the source code of those drivers, tools, and interfaces to analyse
          and integrate a device within a set of interconnected devices from
          different manufacturers. Source code reusability is also key to
          exercise the full right to repair for any third-parties from
          professional repair shops to repair cafés to end users.

          A free license is any license that gives everyone the four freedoms to
