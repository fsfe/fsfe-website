00:00.000 --> 00:18.040
Hello and welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:18.040 --> 00:22.880
This podcast is brought to you by the free Software Foundation Europe and via charity that

00:22.880 --> 00:26.080
empowers users to control technology.

00:26.080 --> 00:30.080
I'm Bonnie Mehring and today I'm here with my colleague, Alexander Sander.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.080
Hi, Bonnie.

00:32.080 --> 00:40.920
So we have done already quite a lot of episodes together, but we are also working on something

00:40.920 --> 00:41.920
else together, right?

00:41.920 --> 00:42.920
This is true.

00:42.920 --> 00:43.920
Yes.

00:43.920 --> 00:51.720
This is the FSFE's programming competition called Youth Hacking for Freedom and today we

00:51.720 --> 00:56.280
will be doing a short episode about it and walk you through the competition and let

00:56.280 --> 00:59.280
you know all the details there.

00:59.280 --> 01:05.120
So Alex, Youth Hacking for Freedom, you want to start and very quickly go over what it

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
is.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
Absolutely.

01:07.120 --> 01:13.800
So this episode is mainly for people who are between 14 and 18 years old and who want to do

01:13.800 --> 01:17.960
a free software project in order to win a prize.

01:17.960 --> 01:23.400
You can win up to 4,000 euros and invitation to pass it to the award ceremony.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.440
So it's absolutely versatile to take part in the competition.

01:26.440 --> 01:31.560
Ultimately, there will be three winners and three special prizes.

01:31.560 --> 01:38.240
So six prizes will be handed over to the winning participants and you have six months to

01:38.240 --> 01:43.800
come up with a free software project that you like so you can do whatever you want.

01:43.800 --> 01:51.280
The only criteria it needs to be free software and yeah, after the six months, your project

01:51.280 --> 01:58.440
will be evaluated by a very nice jury and then winners will be elected and as said, invited

01:58.440 --> 02:03.480
two awards ceremony to pass those which will last a week and in October.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.480
Yes.

02:04.480 --> 02:08.960
And the competition like the programming phase starts on the first of January and ends

02:08.960 --> 02:12.000
on the 30th of June.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.640
So the last day of June and you have six months time to think about your project and realize

02:19.640 --> 02:20.640
it in the end.

02:20.640 --> 02:26.840
In this time, we also have monthly calls where you can participate if you want to and we

02:26.840 --> 02:33.120
discuss topics that are related to free software that are related to project management and

02:33.120 --> 02:35.280
that are related to programming.

02:35.280 --> 02:40.360
So like for example, we also go over how to license a project, we go over how to document

02:40.360 --> 02:44.760
a project and yeah, walk you through all of this.

02:44.760 --> 02:50.840
So basically, you will learn everything during this six months, how to come up with a good

02:50.840 --> 02:51.840
project.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.200
The only thing you have to do is coding.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.680
That's true.

02:55.680 --> 03:01.120
And we know that this can be hard so we also have people supporting you with technical

03:01.120 --> 03:02.120
advice.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.680
Should you have any questions there?

03:04.680 --> 03:11.680
But Bonnie, do you need to be a free software expert in order or programming expert to come

03:11.680 --> 03:17.440
up with such a project or can you also be someone who is starting from crutch who had no

03:17.440 --> 03:20.960
idea about programming and also have a chance to win?

03:20.960 --> 03:23.280
Yes, we did have that in the past, didn't we?

03:23.280 --> 03:30.400
We had somebody who started to learn programming actually during those six months and was

03:30.400 --> 03:36.400
among one of the winners because we do not only evaluate the quality of the code, but

03:36.400 --> 03:42.200
we also evaluate how well documented or the jury evaluates the creativity of the idea

03:42.200 --> 03:50.240
and there are several criteria that are important for the jury and the, in fact, is the decision

03:50.240 --> 03:52.160
of who is among the winners.

03:52.160 --> 03:57.960
So even if you have no idea yet about programming, this is a perfect chance for you to learn it

03:57.960 --> 04:03.720
and this is also a perfect chance for you to be rewarded for it with up to 4,000

04:03.720 --> 04:04.720
euros.

04:04.720 --> 04:05.720
True.

04:05.720 --> 04:11.360
And also, I think we should mention that the jury and this we definitely know takes into

04:11.360 --> 04:13.400
account the age of the participants.

04:13.400 --> 04:20.240
So if you are 14 and compete against 18 year old, we know that this might be challenging.

04:20.240 --> 04:27.360
So that's why our jury also has an eye on like how old you are and in our registration

04:27.360 --> 04:34.560
form and also like during our workshops we have, you can tell us a bit about yourself

04:34.560 --> 04:40.560
and ultimately the jury also will have interviews with shortness candidates of the

04:40.560 --> 04:45.400
project where they learn about participants in order to make sure that there is a balanced

04:45.400 --> 04:54.640
decision and also the jury members know that in particular, yeah, people in this age

04:54.640 --> 04:56.200
have also other duties.

04:56.200 --> 05:00.640
So they have to go to school, they have to learn, they might also have other hobbies.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.160
So that's why we came up with this six months coding period.

05:04.160 --> 05:09.440
So we don't expect you to sit there six months in a row and work on a project, but rather

05:09.440 --> 05:15.760
to give you plenty of time to come up with an idea, to tinker around, to change things.

05:15.760 --> 05:20.480
And also ultimately, it's very common to hang over unfinished projects.

05:20.640 --> 05:28.160
Since we all know a software project is never finished and in this regard, I do believe

05:28.160 --> 05:34.400
that, and this is also what we have seen from the last editions, it's a good idea to take part.

05:34.400 --> 05:40.640
Ideas are valued a lot and how you approach the idea, how you try to tinker around.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.680
So this is something that your members have my own.

05:43.680 --> 05:50.160
So even if you have no clue about coding or how to come up with a free software project,

05:50.160 --> 05:55.360
this is maybe the perfect time to start thinking about it and to take part in this competition

05:55.360 --> 06:01.360
and has a chance to win a prize money and also be invited to process for this award ceremony.

06:01.360 --> 06:05.040
And also, Bonnie, maybe you can tell a bit about the award ceremony.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.920
I do believe it's happening in a very, very nice venue.

06:07.920 --> 06:13.600
I think we already booked everything so we can already announce where it will happen

06:13.600 --> 06:18.320
and what participants can expect, just read and impressive.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.560
Yeah, sure. So we will be in a very grand hotel.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.400
It's called NH Gran Sablon.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.760
And there will be amazing breakfast.

06:27.760 --> 06:31.360
Generally, during the awards ceremony, you will have a lot of food.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.240
So don't worry, there's amazing food everywhere.

06:35.520 --> 06:42.240
And the ceremony itself will take place in BELvue, which is the palace.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.520
And there's a museum attached to it in Brussels.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.480
And there we will be hosting the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom Awards ceremony in the atrium.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.600
And I'm very much looking forward to it.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.440
This is always really grand.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.840
It's very nice and it's amazing to be there.

06:59.840 --> 07:02.720
And there's this feeling of excitement,

07:03.760 --> 07:08.480
like all those people waiting for the prizes to be handed over

07:08.480 --> 07:12.560
and presenting their projects to all family and friends

07:12.640 --> 07:14.560
and sharing members.

07:14.560 --> 07:20.160
And it's really, it's one of the most amazing evenings that I experience during the whole year.

07:20.160 --> 07:21.280
I'm very much in touch.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.320
Yeah, that's true.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.400
And also participants have the chance to network and to learn about other winners.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.840
And we also will have a workshop in the morning that they can tinker around.

07:29.840 --> 07:34.800
And I do also do believe it's a very nice activity to learn about other peers

07:34.800 --> 07:38.400
who are also tinkering around this free software across Europe.

07:38.480 --> 07:41.680
Also in the workshops, even if they are just digital,

07:41.680 --> 07:45.760
we will have breakout rooms where participants can come together

07:45.760 --> 07:49.040
where they can maybe form teams where they can collaborate,

07:49.040 --> 07:51.040
where they can discuss their ideas.

07:51.040 --> 07:54.720
So all of this is also about networking and giving, like,

07:55.360 --> 07:58.640
the participants space to interface each other,

07:58.640 --> 08:02.080
to learn about each other and in this regard.

08:02.080 --> 08:06.560
So it's also a good idea to take part if you want to learn about other

08:07.280 --> 08:11.360
European's who are maybe doing something similar like you

08:11.360 --> 08:14.720
and there you want to meet an exchange with them.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.440
That's true.

08:17.440 --> 08:22.480
I also believe that this has also not only for the, in this light of how

08:23.600 --> 08:25.760
free software works that you have this community there,

08:25.760 --> 08:30.400
but you can also gain something by this in your personal relationships

08:30.400 --> 08:34.720
because you can meet people from all over Europe and get to know them,

08:34.720 --> 08:37.680
get to talk with them, get different perspectives,

08:37.680 --> 08:41.280
and I truly believe that this is also a great benefit

08:41.840 --> 08:44.160
that you can have for your school life,

08:44.160 --> 08:46.960
that you can have for your educational life,

08:46.960 --> 08:47.840
and yes.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.720
So I think that's also something that I like a lot about you,

08:50.720 --> 08:52.400
packing for freedom, actually.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.520
In this regard, go to yh4f.org,

08:55.520 --> 08:59.360
slash register, take part in the registration process,

08:59.360 --> 09:01.760
take part in the use healing for freedom contest,

09:01.840 --> 09:05.360
and if you are outside the age range of 14 to 18,

09:06.320 --> 09:10.720
everyone you know who is in this age range about this competition

09:10.720 --> 09:14.720
and ask them to take part, I think it's worth it.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.560
Yeah, thank you so much for listening,

09:16.560 --> 09:19.040
thank you so much for sharing the news about you packing for me.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.000
Yeah, thanks for having me and for discussing this,

09:22.000 --> 09:23.360
and for running this contest.

09:23.360 --> 09:26.800
So it's a lot of fun to work with you on this project,

09:26.800 --> 09:31.200
and yeah, I really like it and I think everyone in the world should know

09:31.280 --> 09:34.960
about it, and every European teenager should take part.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.000
Thank you, Alex, I can only give that back likewise.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.320
So this was the Software Freedom Podcast

09:44.320 --> 09:46.800
with a special episode on you packing for freedom.

09:47.520 --> 09:51.040
If you liked this episode, please recommend it to your friends

09:51.040 --> 09:55.520
and rate it and also share the news about you packing for freedom, obviously.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.280
Stay tuned for more inspiring conversations

09:59.280 --> 10:01.920
that explore the importance of software freedom

10:01.920 --> 10:03.920
and its impact on our digital lives.

10:05.760 --> 10:09.520
This podcast is presented to you by the free Software Foundation Europe
