<p>
  In this issue we note the shift of the EU Digital Rights Declaration 
  to an unclear, ambiguous text. Free Software chess engine wins its 
  legal battle. Your contribution can help software freedom. YH4F 
  registration. The Greek team meets after a long time.

<h3 id="eu-declaration-of-digital-rights-falls-short-of-its-ambitions">EU Declaration of Digital Rights falls short of its ambitions</h3>

<p>
  <a href="/news/2022/news-20221206-01.html">Member 
  states, the European Parliament and the Commission have reached a 
  consensus on the Declaration of Digital Rights and Principles</a>. 
  The Declaration aims to serve as a reference point for the digital 
  transformation of Europe. Instead, it descends into murky waters, 
  causing ambiguity. The wording is unclear and the declaration 
  overlooks existing good proposals.
</p>

<p>
  The Declaration is said to be built upon previous initiatives such as 
  the Berlin and <a href="/news/2017/news-20170710-01.html">Tallinn</a> 
  declarations. These frameworks already referred to Free Software 
  concerning digital sovereignty and interoperability, required more 
  use of Free Software, and strengthened the requirement for its use. 
  It is striking that concerning interoperability, Free Software is not 
  explicitly mentioned in the Declaration of Digital Rights and 
  Principles.

<h3 id="copyleft-licensed-chess-engine-wins-legal-case-against-proprietary-counterpart">Copyleft-licensed chess engine wins legal case against proprietary counterpart</h3>

<p>
  Copyleft protects Free Software from becoming proprietary. Free 
  Software chess engine Stockfish filed a lawsuit when ChessBase 
  distributed parts of Stockfish work under a proprietary license, 
  violating GPL-3.0 obligations. Checkmate! <a href="/news/2022/news-20221212-01.html">Stockfish was 
  victorious</a>. ChessBase must comply fully with GPL-3, hire a Free 
  Software Compliance Officer, and list their Free Software elements 
  online, before they can distribute the Stockfish software or make it 
  publicly available again.

<p>
  <a href="/news/2022/news-20221205-01.html">Your 
  support and contribution for the promotion of Free Software are 
  important</a> for securing our continuous work, ensuring our

  implementing concrete steps towards software freedom, and making it 
  easier to use and develop Free Software.

<h3 id="fsfe-groups">FSFE groups</h3>

<p>
  Our groups welcome everyone who is interested in Free Software to 
  join, and abide to the Code of Conduct. Here is what they are up 
  to.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Germany</strong>: A festive meeting marked the end of the year at the FSFE 
  local Berlin group. Nikolai from &quot;cosum&quot; joined as speaker. 
  cosum (from CO-llaborative con-SUM-ption) is a lending platform that 
  allows people to share things like tools, gardening equipment, or 
  gazebos. With this, the group wants to promote more social-ecological 
  consumption models. With cosum, a public lending store can be 
  founded, but also private-to-private lending between friends and 
  lending in communities, e.g. in the house or neighborhood, are 
  possible. Borrowing saves resources, money, and space. Hamburg has 
  monthly meetings in-person.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Greece</strong>: <a href="/events/events.html#event-20221215-01">After 
  a long time without meetings, next  Thursday 15 December the FSFE 
  Greece country team gathers in a first introductory meeting</a>. The 
  topics to be discussed include Mastodon and its current developments, 
  Greek instances, recommendations for content in the Greek language, 
  and usage tips. Nikos Roussos, developer at libreops, will talk about 
  Libretooth. Fani Partsafyllidou, FSFE Project Manager, will share 
  updates about Free Software in Europe. Just drop by!
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Netherlands</strong>: During their last meeting the team discussed a <a href="https://gitea-open-letter.coding.social/">Gitea governance 
  conflict</a>. The Fair Digital Education coalition, in which the FSFE 
  participates through the country team Netherlands, became an <a href="https://isoc.nl/nieuws/new-isoc-nl-working-group-coalition-fair-digital-education-cfde">Internet 
  Society chapter</a>. The group also debated a worrying phenomenon in 
  the Netherlands, where citizens form WhatsApp groups with policing 
  purposes. There is a question if a standalone Belgium group can be 
  formed. The next meeting is on 21 December.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Switzerland</strong>: <strong>Basel</strong>: In their previous meeting, the FSFE local group 
  Basel discussed the dependency of schools upon proprietary software. 
  The experiences of the members were similar; schools have a 
  simplistic approach to software. The best way is to correct this is 
  to demonstrate the benefits of Free Software in a playful and visual 
  way. The group compared Tor, VPN, and Freifunk as privacy options. A 
  member from the Zurich group encouraged the Basel group to adopt a 
  project based strategy. <strong>Zurich</strong>: The FSFE local group Zurich has 
  launched the FediGov campaign and has created a leaflet for the 
  campaign ‘Learn like a pro’.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Women</strong>: In the last online meeting Fani presented the Upcycling 
  Android open letter to the group. Then, the team talked about joining 
  the decentralized and independent alternative events of 37c3. In the 
  previous meeting the group discussed radio technology, an example of 
  a <a href="https://mycroft.ai/">privacy-focused voice assistant</a>, 
  and colour printing.
