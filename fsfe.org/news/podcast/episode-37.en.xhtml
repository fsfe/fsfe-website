<h1>SFP#37: Policy and EU: The most famous of them all – we are talking about the CRA</h1>

<p>Most of you have heard of the famous Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), a legislation introducing CE labels for digital products. In our latest episode of the 
Software Freedom Podcast Bonnie and Alex have a easy to follow conversation about the CRA and what will be happening next.</p>

and since then a lot has happened. In this episode they will give you a short introduction into the CRA and dive into the current discussions surrounding 
its implementation. Learn how you can support the FSFE in safeguarding Free Software during the implementation process with <a href="/news/2025/news-20250717-01.html">answering the questionnaire</a>
