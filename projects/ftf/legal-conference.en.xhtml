        <h1>The European Legal Network Conference</h1>

    <p>
The European Legal Network Conference is held every year to allow legal experts to discuss the future of Free Software licenses and associated best practice in this field. This has become the world's premier event for debating, discussing and sharing knowledge around Free Software legal affairs.  In 2011 it will take place over two days and across one track, combining an environment of talk and panels with plenty of time for informal networking and discussion.  The focus will be on legal fact rather than opinion, the imperatives of the growing eco-system, and the importance of truly international transactions (trans-border, trans-language, trans-system).  The event will be grounded in realism, aiming to contextualize Free Software law as a field, the current situation and requirements, and to propose solutions to deal with the largest challenges.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      The conference will feature speakers like Carlo Piana from FSFE, Mark Shuttleworth from Canonical, Eben Moglen from SFLC, and Harald Welte from gpl-violations.org.  Our theme for 2011 is 
      'Free Software law for the next ten years.'
