        <title>SFSCON '23 - Why Do We Need A Next Generation Internet? in Bolzano, Italy</title>

    <body>
      <p>What can be done to improve the Internet as a platform for future generations? What initiatives are currently in place to build key technological blocks of an Internet that supports human-centric values, such as privacy, security, and inclusion, while reflecting the values and norms all citizens should enjoy in Europe?</p>
      <p>In this talk, Gabriel Ku Wei Bin  will explore why the current state of the internet must be re-imagined and re-engineered in order to support healthy societies, the existing European Commission initiative to work towards doing so, and the role of Free Software in accomplishing these goals.<br/>
