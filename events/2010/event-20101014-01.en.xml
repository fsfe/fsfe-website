   <title>Monthly Fellowship meeting in Berlin, Germany</title>
   <body>
  <p> This month again, the Berlin Fellowship meeting will be in the Newthinking Store, in the <a href="http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=Tucholskystr.+48">Tucholskystr. 48, 10117 Berlin</a>.
   We'll be there from 19:30. Torsten Grote will do a presentation on "Centralised Internet Services and Problems of Power". This talk will illustrate the trend towards centralised services and explain the reasons for this trend. It will conclude with some solutions and strategies that can help users to 
remain in control of their computing and their data. Other topics for this meeting are the ongoing PDF readers campaign, and the two events to come : FSCONS and BLIT, both on the 6th of November.</p>

<p>As usual, this invitation is for everyone interested 
   in the FSFE or Free Software. We're looking forward to seeing 
   you there!</p>
