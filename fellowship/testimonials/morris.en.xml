            Free Software challenges you to learn: to do for yourself, to be 
            fearlessly independent when it comes to your tech. In the past few 
            years I have taken pride in watching my skill base catchup with and 
            overtake that of my proprietary-loving peers, even some paid 
            professionals, simply by having a free and curious mindset. Free 
            Software frees you in many ways.
