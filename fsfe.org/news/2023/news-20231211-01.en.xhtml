<p>We are looking for a motivated intern to support the FSFE’s policy activities and contribute to our work to empower people to control technology. The person will work 35 hours per week with our team in the FSFE Berlin office for a period of six months.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-fsfe">About the FSFE</h2>
<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to control technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives and it is important that technology empowers rather than restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the right to use, understand, adapt, and share software. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press, and privacy.</p>
<p>The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination. It enhances users’ rights by abolishing barriers to Free Software adoption, encourages people to use and develop Free Software, and provides resources to enable everyone to further promote Free Software in Europe. </p>
<p>The FSFE is involved in many activities in the legal, economic, political, and technical areas around Free Software. This work is made possible by a community of volunteers, supporters, donors, and staff.</p>
