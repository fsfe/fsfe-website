    <div id="introduction">
      <p>Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to
      control technology.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our
    lives. It is important that this technology empowers rather than
    restricts us. <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> gives everybody the rights to use, understand,
    adapt and share software. These rights help support other fundamental
    rights like freedom of speech, freedom of press and privacy.</p>

    <p>Free Software Foundation Europe:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination.</li>
      <li>enhances users' rights by abolishing barriers to Free Software adoption.</li>
      <li>encourages people to use and develop Free Software.</li>
      <li>provides resources to enable everyone to further promote Free Software in Europe.</li>
    </ul>
