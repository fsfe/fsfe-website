  international GPLv3 conference</a>, organised by FSFE in Barcelona.
  The entire conference was recorded and links to the audio and video
  are provided below next to each summary.

<p>The videos are in Ogg Theora format, the audio files are in Ogg
  Vorbis format, and these can be downloaded with BitTorrent.</p>

  With participants from four continents, containing programmers,
  lawyers, organisations, and representatives from each of the four
  GPLv3 discussion committees, these panels provide quite a whole

<h2 id="greve">Georg Greve: opening introduction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Audio: <a href="fsfe-gplv3-georg-greve.vorbis.ogg.torrent">http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/fsfe-gplv3-georg-greve.vorbis.ogg.torrent</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Points covered by <a href="/about/greve/greve.html">Georg Greve</a>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Opening address</li>

<li>Background of FSF and GNU</li>

<li>FSF maintains the Free Software Definition, the GPL, and the
  LGPL</li>

<li>FSF is about long term strategy</li>

<li>GPL is the pragmatic implementation and it makes parties with
  different goals work together</li>

<li>FSF started in MIT in Boston, but now there is a network of FSFs</li>

<li>There are four: FSF, FSF Europe, FSF India, FSF Latin America</li>

<li>Independent equals with some shared focuses and some
  differentiating focuses</li>

<li>Transparency is a lot of work, but FSFE feels it's important</li>

<li>FSFE is active in 10 countries through 25 people, working largely
  on a consensus basis</li>

<li>Of the 25, 10 have taken legal responsibility and are on the
  General Assembly, and that GA elects the president </li>

<li>FSFE has 13 associate organisations, mostly in Europe but also in
  Japan and Latin America </li>

<li>As well as many volunteers, FSFE has 5 full-time and 2 half-time
  employees, and we might have another full-time employee soon </li>

<li>If are interested in working with us, contact a Team member from
  your region.  We try to work with people in their language.  If you
  want to help, you're incredibly welcome </li>

<li>We do a lot of work at the United Nations, a lot in the European
  Union, a lot at the national level - legal work and business work
  and the Fellowship </li>

<li>Our focus for these two days is the GPL - the #1 Free Software
  licence </li>

<li>FSF is handling the GPLv3 process, and for that, we are here to
  help </li>

<p>
  [00:00 - 15:00 ]Topics discussed by Carlo Piana about
  the <a href="/projects/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.html">EU anti-trust case
  against Microsoft</a>:
</p>

<ul>

<li>The situation when we joined the case, our goals, and our achievements </li>

<li>Microsoft was found guilty of anti-trust abuse, in &quot;the
  Monti decision&quot; </li>

<li>This decision imposed the largest fine ever for abuse of a
  dominant position, which is an anti-trust abuse, and required some
  remedies </li>

<li>One of those remedies is that Microsoft is supposed to provide
  complete documentation for Windows Workgroup server under
  reasonable and non-discriminatory clauses </li>

<li>Microsoft not happy, and they appealed </li>

<li>We asked for &quot;leave to intervene&quot;, and it was
  granted, so we can testify </li>

<li>This is a case which has been constantly breaking records, in
  terms of size </li>

<li>Our goal, of course, was not Microsoft-bashing.  Our main goal
  was to get Microsoft to start behaving like a good citizen </li>

<li>We want to establish a precedent, that companies cannot abuse
  their market power, especially not against Free Software </li>

<li>By being in the process, we have made useful allies and built our
  reputation </li>

<li>We are now getting quite respectful coverage from the media </li>

</ul>

<p>
  [15:00 - 22:40] Topics discussed by Pablo Machón
  O'Riordan <a href="/projects/swpat/swpat.html">software patents</a>
  and other legislative issues in Brussels:
</p>


<p>
  [22:40 - 31:30] Topics discussed by Ciarán
  O'Riordan <a href="/projects/swpat/swpat.html">software patents</a>
  and other legislative issues in Brussels:
</p>

<ul>

<li>I'm mostly working on GPLv3 this year, but the main work I do is
  about legislation </li>

<li>Sometimes this means talking to the politicians, sometimes it
  means coaching others who the politicians are more interested in
  talking to </li>

<li>We network the MEPs to build support - turning pockets of support
  into majorities </li>

<li>Pablo will talk about software patents later, so I want to
  mention the bigger picture that they are part of </li>

<li>Software patents were indirect discrimination </li>

<li>It's a burden that can't be born by many of our models </li>

<li>This issue will come back, but it won't come back in the same form
  - we've won too conclusively for the same to be tried again </li>

<li>One possibility is the community patent, and another is the
  European Patent Litigation agreement.  Instead of changing the
  legislation, these change who makes the final rulings </li>

<li>There is also
  the <a href="/projects/ipred2/ipred2.html">IPRED2</a> - this
  criminalises many copyright, trademark, and patent infringements.
  It doesn't touch Free Software directly, but it makes software
  development a dangerous field, and makes grey areas seem not worth
  risking - such as, maybe, software patents </li>

<li>No out of court settlements, no insurance </li>

<li>I moved into legislation because our software is so good.
  Legislation is a week point for us, so we need more peopl to look
  at this </li>

<li>When we do this work, we have to build a movement.  We can't
  start from scratch each time, we have to build teams and networks
  and relationships with politicians and journalists </li>

<li>&quot;You can leave politics alone, but it won't leave you
  alone&quot;, a wise man said</li>

</ul>

<p>
  [31:30 - 45:10] Topics discussed by Stefano Maffulli
  about <a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org">The Fellowship</a>:
</p>

<ul>

<li>I'm an architect, which makes me a software user </li>

<li>Speedbumps don't discriminate, they don't disappear when an
  ambulance needs to drive on the road - Free Software is about being
  able to control and shape our environment ourselves </li>

<li>Free Software, is about participation and inclusion </li>

<li>The software patent discussion shows that we can influence
  legislation </li>

<li>The Fellowship is a tool for collaboration, it's a community of
  people that support software freedom </li>

<li>We want to get people active and provide information </li>

<li>Most are hackers, these are people that know their tools very
  well </li>

<li>Fellows have an instant messaging server so they can communicate
  with each other, and a blog, and an email alias </li>

<li>The Fellowship programme has been active for 16 months now, and
  we're starting to see local activities </li>

<li>Most actions by the Fellows, are started independent of FSFE.
  The Fellows are taking the initiative and giving speeches and
  distributing information </li>

<li>That's the spirit: a community of people that want to do
  things </li>

<li>Fellows have an active connection to FSFE </li>

<li>We've made Fellowship cookies, or &quot;Freedom fighter&quot;
  cookies, and the recipe is available </li>

<li>So far, the Fellowship contributions have allowed us to hire
  Ciarán to work during the software patents battle, now we have
  surplus to possibly hire another </li>
