	<h3 id="YH4F">Winners of the 2024 Youth Hacking 4 Freedom announced</h3> 

	<p>
	The 2024 edition of the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom (YH4F) competition, 
	organised by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), successfully 
	concluded with <a href="/news/2024/news-20241027-01.html">an inspiring 
	award ceremony weekend in Brussels</a>. Young developers from all over 
	Europe were recognised for their Free Software projects and presented 
	their work to an audience that included their families, jury members, 
	and new-found friends.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/YH4F/YH4F%20winners.pdf">six 
	winning projects</a>, developed by young people aged between 14 and 18 
	and presented at the 2024 award ceremony, are: a federated social 
	network, an app to help dementia patients, software for finding events 
	and connecting with people in your area, a unique rhythm game, and an 
	app for sharing sheets of music and lyrics.
	</p> 

<p>
<a href="/activities/yh4f">YH4F</a> is a unique programming contest 
designed to give Europeans aged 14 to 18 the opportunity to showcase 
their programming skills and creativity by developing Free Software 
projects.
</p>


	<h3 id="Apple-EC">Apple vs. European Commission: the FSFE launches a page with comprehensive information</h3> 

	<p>
	The FSFE is intervening for Free Software in a key court case involving 
	Apple and the European Commission. Apple is trying to avoid obligations 
	derived from the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The FSFE seeks to hold 
	Apple accountable under the DMA in a developer-friendly way.
	</p>

<p>
The decision to intervene in this case was not made lightly. But how 
could we stand by while the Free Software movement faces this affront? 
Yes, we decided to take action. We have just launched a dedicated 
website with comprehensive information about the case: <a 
href="/activities/apple-litigation/">https://fsfe.org/activities/apple-litigation/</a>.
</p>

<p>
We assert Apple should compete based on trustworthiness. Developers and 
users alike should benefit from alternative services and products, not 
just those offered, and controlled by Apple. Our plea is for fair 
competition, IT security, and consumer protection.
</p> 
<p>
More people need to be aware of this court case. We are asking you to 
help spread the word! After reaching out, please share your experiences 
with us.

	<h3 id="SFSCON">Where the FSFE Shapes the Future: SFSCON 2024!</h3>

	<p>
	We are excited to be back for the <a 
	href="https://www.sfscon.it/">South Tyrol Free Software Conference 
	(SFSCON)</a> on 8 and 9 November! SFSCON is the place to be if you’re 
	passionate about Free Software. Whether you’re a seasoned developer, a 
	curious newcomer, or a decision-maker, join us to learn, share, and get 
	inspired by Free Software in Bolzano.
	</p>

<p>
As well as a booth full of promotional material and merchandising, we 
will also be running <a href="/events/events.html">talks and 
workshops</a>, including a session on our <a 
href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/for-the-right-of-general-purpose-computers/">DMA 
legal case</a> and the urgent <a 
href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/lessons-from-the-eus-next-generation-internet-initiatives/">need 
for sustainable, long-term financial support</a>. We will also find out 
who will receive the 2024 European SFS Award! Hope to see you at the NOI 
park for some great discussions!

<h3 id="router-freedom">Exceptions against Router Freedom undermine users’ rights in Italy</h3>
	 
<p>In 2018 Italy implemented Router Freedom. However regulatory decisions 
in 2019 and 2023 introduced exceptions for fiber networks. The FSFE has 
now urged Italy’s telecom regulator, AGCOM, <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20241016-01.html">to remove these restrictions and 
fully restore users' rights to choose their own equipment to connect to 
fiber networks</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="REUSE">REUSE: Specification 3.3 and version 5.0.0 of the tool coming soon</h3> 

<p>
<a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> makes it easier to license 
code as Free Software by providing the tools and documentation that 
developers need. Developers can apply standards-compliant and 
comprehensive licensing information to their projects without needing to 
be legal experts.
</p>

<p>
In a few days, we will release new versions of this project started in 
2017 to make licensing easy, comprehensive, unambiguous, and 
machine-readable. REUSE consists of a specification that standardises 
licensing, a tool that helps achieve and verify compliance with the 
specification, and documentation that helps developers through the 
process. The new specification and tool will contain many small 
improvements to make the process of licensing your code easier than 
ever.
</p>


<h3 id="ada">Ada &amp; Zangemann: inventions from children!</h3>
<p>
"Now, you can enjoy the <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/j1c6LQVZ8qnCLLwpXMuw3M">Ada &amp; 
Zangemann movie in English</a> and start dreaming up all the amazing 
inventions you’d love to create! After watching the movie, some students 
from a local school did just that, <a 
href="https://pics.fsfe.org/gallery/KzugmuUWjRtfWyfCWlkMyOX4">and they 
shared their creations with us!</a>
</p>

<p>

<h3 id="conferences">Back to the stages</h3>

<p>
On October 26 2024, Dario Presutti, FSFE Project Manager, took part in 
the Linux Day Milan 2024. The event took place at the Bicocca University 
of Milan and was organised by two Free Software student associations and 
the Italian Linux Society. This day was a great opportunity with an 
enthusiastic crowd, including young newcomers. There were a Public 
Money? Public Code! talk and a live reading of Ada and Zangemann. With I 
Love Free Software posters and Ada’s story as conversation starters, we 
connected with attendees passionate about Free Software in education, 
sparking discussions about collaboration and awareness for FSFE's 
initiatives.
</p>

<p>
Our local group in Poland recently had a fantastic time at Jesień 
Linuksowa (Linux Autumn), where they had a FSFE information booth! This 
annual event, organized by the Polish Linux Users Group (PLUG), is a 
major gathering for GNU/Linux and Free Software enthusiasts and one of 
the largest events of its kind in Poland. We’re thrilled to have 
connected with so many passionate members of the community!
</p>
