            I believe that actions of support for the FSFE are important for 
            encouraging Free Software development and adoption in Europe as well as 
            the rest of the world. I&#39;m an FSFE Fellow because financially 
            supporting the cause of Free Software brings positive improvements to 
            all societies throughout the world.
