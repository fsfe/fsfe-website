      Welcome to the home page of the Free Software Foundation Europe.
      The FSF Europe was launched on 10 March 2001 and supports all
      European aspects of Free Software; especially the <a
        href="documents/gnuproject.html">GNU Project</a>. We are actively
      supporting development of Free Software and furthering GNU-based
      Operating Systems such as GNU/Linux. Also, we provide an assistance
      centre for politicians, lawyers and journalists in order to secure
      the legal, political and social future of Free Software.
