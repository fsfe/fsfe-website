<h1>Support “Public Money? Public Code!” with a SharePic</h1>


<p>
Since the launch of the “Public Money? Public Code!” initiative, it has grown a lot and experienced an increase of support. Now there is a new and fun way of showing your support for “Public Money? Public Code!”. With the new SharePic-Template, everybody can show their support of the campaign. 
</p>

<p>
For almost 5 years now the “Public Money? Public Code!” initiative has demanded that software for the public sector must be released under a Free Software license. Since 2017 a lot has happened. The <a href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">Open Letter</a> has been signed by over 210 organisations, by six public administrations, and over 33.000 individuals. Besides the support of the Open Letter people have also shown their support by translating the material of the initiative; the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">webpage</a>, has been translated into 21 languages. Similarly, the “Public Money? Public Code!” brochure, which was just recently translated by a team of volunteers into <a href="/news/2022/news-20220531-01.html">Italian</a>, so far has been translated to <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/pmpc/PMPC-Modernising-with-Free-Software.de.pdf">German</a>, <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/pmpc/PMPC-Modernising-with-Free-Software.cz.pdf">Czech</a>, <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/pmpc/PMPC-Modernising-with-Free-Software.pt_br.pdf">Brazilian Portuguese</a>, and <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/pmpc/ES/FSFE_Policy_Brochure_PMPC_ALL_es.pdf">Spanish</a>.</p>

<p>The “Public Money? Public Code!” initiative has grown immensely, and with the increasing support we have also created more and more promotional material for it. Among this are the <a href="/activities/publiccode/brochure">brochure</a>, <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#pmpc">stickers</a>, and the <a href ="https://media.fsfe.org/w/7cH6EATpmPwaMsEZN8vfyj">”Public Money? Public Code!” video</a>. The newest addition to the  material is the new “SharePic-Template” for “Public Money? Public Code!”. The SharePic, designed by Markus Meier, is now online on the <a href ="https://publiccode.eu/sharepic">FSFE’s Sharepic-generator</a>. The SharePic can be used to show your support of “Public Money? Public Code!” in a fun way on your favourite social media channel.
