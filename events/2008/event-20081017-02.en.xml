    <title>Fellowship meeting in Vienna</title>
    <body>
      On 17 October 2008, a Fellowship meeting takes place in Vienna.
      We meet around 18:00 in the Library Room at the Metalab, Rathausstra√üe 6,
      first district. The discussions will start at 19:00.<br/>
      Items on the agenda include our pages in the Fellowship wiki, our
      advocacy project, and some small organisational things.  As always,
      the meeting is ended with a nice chat over a beer.<br/>
      As usual, this invitation addresses to all people interested in FSFE or
      Free Software. We are looking forward to many attendants!
