  After five months of coding and the subsequent evaluation, the last 
  and super exciting part of the competition finally took place at the 
  beginning of October with a two-day trip to Brussels where the 
  winners received the awards!

  The award ceremony was held at the lovely setting of the BELvue 
  Museum in Brussels, where the winners went after a city tour. 
  Reinhard Wiesemann, donor of the YH4F, opened the ceremony and shared 
  a few words about his own experience of winning a hacking 
  competition.

  The three winners – the Ultimate Hacker, the Elite Hacker and the 
  Awesome Hacker awards – were given the chance to present their 
  projects. Attendees got a glimpse of Artur’s Aspinwall project and 
  the Smart Table Assistant robot created by Miquel. They watched Sign 
  Track in action, the software coded by Stravos.
</p>

<p>
  “After winning the YH4F, I have received a lot of support from my 
  school, in particular from the Sign Language team, which is 
  especially motivating me to further expand my project”, added 
  Stavros.

<p>
  Next to those three awards the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom awarded three 
  more prizes: the Youngest Hacker Award, the Special Hacker Award and 
  the Ultimate Hacker Girl Award. These three rewards want to focus on 
  the importance of equal opportunities and diversity in the 
  technological field.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, Mark, the winner of the Special Hacker Award from 
  Ukraine, could not travel to Brussels. But to highlight Mark’s work 
  for the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom contest and to give everybody the 
  chance to see his amazing project “Sharik”, it was presented by a 
  member of the jury on his behalf.
</p>

<p>
  The final two special-award-winners, Hector -Youngest Hacker award- 
  and Ekaterina -Ultimate Hacker Girl- presented their projects, 
  LibreHomework and Music Companion respectively. “I had no prior 
  knowledge of coding and started learning after hearing the news about 
  Youth Hacking 4 Freedom and deciding to take part”, explained 
  Ekaterina to the audience.
</p>
