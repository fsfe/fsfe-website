  <h2 class="painted" id="about-the-workshops">About the Workshops</h2>

  <p>In collaboration with local partners and groups the FSFE runs "Upcycling Android" workshops to help you with the technical part of upgrading your default Android phone with a Custom ROM. You can read about how this works and why it matters on our <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/howtoupcycle.html">how to upcycle</a> page.</p>

  <p>In these workshops you can usually bring certain devices for that our volunteers will help you with the upcycling process. In addition we also bring devices with us that you can use to play and tinker around. That means you do not necessarily need to flash your own phone during an Upcycling Android workshop. You can also learn from others doing so or you can even come to help others.</p>

  <p>Apart from directly helping users to upcycle their phone, our Upcycling Android workshops are also intended to bring diverse people together on the same topic. People who feel strong about reducing ewaste and save the environment have the chance to meet people who care about software freedom and technologies - and vice versa. </p>

  <p>Since we are working together with local groups, any workshop is unique and different. They happen in different places and locations and they also put different focus each. Some focus on installing Android alternatives others might concentrate on installing full GNU/Linux replacements. But even within these categories they might differ in the actual operating system they concentrate on installing and to offer help with. You find the full descriptions and information about participation in <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/Android/UpcyclingWorkshops/">our wiki-pages</a>. Please read the desctiptions carefully to be sure you choose the workshop that matches your interests. Find some general remarks for all workshops below.</p>

  <h2 class="painted" id="about-the-workshops">General remarks on the workshops</h2>
