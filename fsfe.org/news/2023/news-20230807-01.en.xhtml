<h1>Unleash the potential of your phone: Rooting your device does not void its warranty</h1>

<p>As users we sometimes face the issue of rooting our devices. We may 
want to regain control of our 
device or we may want to keep using a 
device with an outdated operating system. But we are afraid of losing 
our legal warranty. Letâ€™s be clear: Just rooting your device and 
installing new software will not void the statutory warranty.</p>

<p>EU law stipulates that consumers should have a minimum 2-year 
guarantee (statutory warranty)  when acquiring a new device. However, 
in the past few years, vendors have tended to include specific clauses 
stating that if the consumer changes the device, the warranty will be 
void. That is why the question of whether rooting or flashing a device 
voids the statutory warranty is quite recurrent. <strong><u>The answer is no</u></strong>.</p>

<p>The FSFE has previously addressed this <a href="/activities/android/flashingdevices.html">issue</a>. In short, if 
you 
acquire a device as a consumer in the European Union, the mere fact 
that you have modified or changed the software of your device by 
rooting or flashing it is not a sufficient reason to void your 
statutory warranty. </p>

<p>Since our previous discussion of this topic, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L0771">Sale 
of Goods 
Directive 2019/771 (the SGD)</a> was enacted, repealing the previous 
1999/44/CE Directive, which provided the original statutory warranty. 
The SGD deals with the contract of sale between a consumer and a 
seller, and it entered into force on June 11, 2019, applying its 
provisions to any contract concluded after January 1, 2022<a id="ref-1" href="#fn-1" role="doc-noteref"/>.</p>

<h3>Reasons to root your device</h3> 

<p>Rooting the phone and installing Free Software <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/upcyclingandroid.html">extends the 
lifespan of the device</a>. Most phone devices are not controlled by the users, but by the manufacturer 
and the operator of the telephone network. The software that runs on them is not entirely Free Software. 
Even Android phones ship with non-free software and proprietary add-ons 
that often work <a href="/activities/android/android.html">against the full interest of the user</a>.
</p>

<p>
Through rooting or flashing a device, the user can take complete 
control over it. When consumers buy a phone they buy the physical 
aspects of the phone. They should be free to choose which 
software  should be on their phone without having the fear of losing 
the warranty. Monopolies hurt fair competition and consumers. 
Companies/vendors regulating operating systems which provide critical online 
services, results in limiting user choice and freedom. <a href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index.html">The devices 
should therefore be neutral</a> so as to enable the users to freely choose 
any software on their phones without any conditions.
</p>

<h3>The SGD is on your side</h3> 


<p>At the FSFE we have already analyzed <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/is-flashing-legal.html">the 
changes brought in by the SGD</a> and how they impact rooting and 
the statutory warranty.</p>

<p>The SGD covers goods with digital content, including smartphones, 
smart TVs, smart watches, and fitness trackers<a id="ref-2" href="#fn-2" role="doc-noteref"/>.
All such goods covered under the SGD must have a <strong>mandatory
two-year warranty</strong><a id="ref-3" href="#fn-3" role="doc-noteref"/> from the seller 
that the product will meet the purposes for which products of the same 
type would normally be used. One of the main changes enacted by the SGD 
is the reverse burden of proof. This means that if your device becomes 
defective <strong>within one year</strong><a id="ref-4" href="#fn-4" role="doc-noteref"/>, 
it is presumed that the defect was present 
all along, and you do not need to prove anything; instead, it is the 
seller who has to prove that this is not the case. This period was six 
months under the previous 1999/44/CE Directive. </p> 

<p>There are currently no instances of litigated cases about warranty 
issues when rooting, flashing, or jailbreaking smartphones in Europe, 
nor has there been a rule or provision on this issue. This makes the 
legality of such acts unclear. So, you can root your phone, but if you 
wish to keep the warranty intact without any problems, then reverse the 
root to the stock operating system and check if everything was undone. 
If the stock OS functions as it should, then you do not have an issue. 
</p>

<h3>Future Updates to Keep An Eye On</h3>

<p>Lastly, you should know that the SGD is relatively new as it came 
into effect in January 2022. The European Commission, under the 
Sustainable Consumption of Goods-Promoting Repair and Reuse Programme, 
has already introduced a proposal for a directive to make some changes 
to the SGD to accommodate repairing obligations on the producers and to 
encourage consumers to choose repair over replacement if there is a 
possibility. This can also have an impact on the subject matter of this 
article.</p>

<p>The FSFE will keep you updated on this issue as and when there are more developments.</p>
