    ”I have been programming since 1969. In a time where computing was still in its
	infancy I can honestly say that I would not have learned as much about computing
	as fast if it had not been for programmers sharing their source code for the programs
	they wrote so I could study that code.

	In today's world many developers and companies benefit from the collaboration of
	"Permissive Open Source", source code licensed which does not require the
	programmers to make their changes available to the next person in line. Without the
	complete source code and build steps needed to produce the binaries for the end
	users the situation is just as bad (or worse) than completely closed source code. The
	end user, the person who depends on that software working and meeting their needs,
	has no ability to change the code to meet their needs or even maintain the code
	when the original developer or company loses interest in it. Only Free Software,
	represented by the so-called "Restrictive Open Source" licenses such as the GPL,
	benefits the end user. It is THAT simple.”
