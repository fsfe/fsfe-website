  <h1>#ilovefs Report 2017: Love and Activism</h1>
  
<p>On Tuesday 14th of February, the "I Love Free 
Software" day was celebrated for its eighth consecutive year, in what 
can now be called a tradition. This day has become a special day for 
people all around the world to declare their love and affection not 
only to their partner but also to the whole Free Software 
community.</p>

<p>The FSFE would like to thank everybody who participated during this 
year’s #ilovefs campaign. Thank you for taking the time to show your 
appreciation to the people that make Free Software possible: the 
developers, designers, testers, translators and projects that work hard 
every day to preserve our freedoms. And thanks to everybody for your 
pictures, videos, blogs and news posted during the 14th, before or 
after. Because of you, the #ilovefs campaign has become an authentic 
success. </p>

<h2>FOSDEM: Find your way into love</h2>

<p>The first love signs were shown at FOSDEM in the beginning of 
February. This year we held again our IloveFS photobooth and many 
people, (<a 
href="https://twitter.com/fsfe/status/831596374663716864">but don't 
assume only people</a>) posed in front of our camera in order to 
confess their love for their favourite Free Software projects, 
colleagues and community contributors (<a 
href="/activities/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.en.html">see 
our full gallery</a>). When we asked them why they love FS, words such 
as Free Society, Democracy and Freedom were repeatedly written on our 
black chalkboards. Who said, you cannot love and be wise at the same 
time?</p>

<p>In this ambient full of love, we also distributed around 20 IloveFS 
packages to Free Software projects present at FOSDEM. Each package 
included a variety of stickers, leaflets, balloons and a paper with 
creative ideas in order to grant some inspiration to all those 
considering to participate in this year's celebrations.</p>

<h2>Letters 'n' Roses</h2>

<p>631 is the number of elected MPs in the German Parliament. This is 
also the number of <a 
href="/activities/ilovefs/2017/ilovefs-OpenLetter.pdf">letters</a> 
and flowers that <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/2017/ilovefs-berlin-2017-9.jpg">FSFE 
volunteers and staff prepared and delivered</a> to every single one of 
them for the IloveFS Day. The main aim was to use this occasion to 
raise awareness among parliamentarians and invite candidates - in 
advance of the German elections taking place this autumn - to support 
Free Software and endorse the idea of "Public Money Public Code". But 
no, this is not all...</p>

<h2>Berlin and Frankfurt love Free Software to bits</h2>

<p>The FSFE volunteers, based in Berlin did not stop there! They chose 
to combine once again political activism with their love for Free 
Software and <a 
href="https://netzpolitik.org/2017/guerilla-projektionen-zum-i-love-free-software-tag-in-berlin/">spent 
a night in the streets of Berlin with a light projector</a> and thought-provoking love messages on the <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/2017/ilovefs-berlin-2017-1.jpg">German 
Parliament</a>, the <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/2017/ilovefs-berlin-2017-3.jpg">Federal 
Ministry of Finance</a>, the Berlin Wall and other places of public 
interest. In the end, <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/2017/ilovefs-berlin-2017-4.jpg">even 
the Berlin Astronaut admitted the universe's love for Free 
Software</a>.</p>

<p>On the very same night of the 14th, some Pirates of Hesse also took 
part in the beamer action and displayed messages of Free Software 
affection <a 
href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/blixxter/32872437596/">all around 
Frankfurt</a>.</p>

<h2>14th</h2>
<p>And finally, the big day has arrived. During Tuesday, 14 February, people 
all around the world expressed their appreciation to Free Software and the 
people that make it possible, in many ways, including blog posts, pictures, news 
items, microblogs and funny memes. Keeping with the cheesy theme, <a href="https://twitter.com/Olga_Gkotso/status/830404271392833536">heart-shaped 
specially decorated chocolates</a> could not be missing from such a day.</p>

<p>The day was full of love for Free Software projects and developers. 
For example, <a 
href="https://femgeeks.de/ilovefs-lineage-os/">Femgeeks</a>  wrote 
about their love for the Lineage OS.  The <a 
href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/whats-a-cryptovalentine">FSF 
asked people to become each other's cryptovalentines</a> by setting up 
private and encrypted communication with GnuPG. Others showed their 
love to <a href="https://ctrl.blog/entry/ilovefs-2017">GNU/Linux</a>, 
<a href="https://ctrl.blog/entry/ilovefs-2017">Ikiwiki and git 
annex</a>

<p>Also, we were really happy to see that many organisations, coming 
from different backgrounds and regions, decided to promote the “I love 
Free Software” campaign from their respective websites. <a 
href="http://medialab-prado.es/article/dia-del-amor-por-el-software-libre-ilovefs-2017">Medialab 
Prado</a>, in Madrid, organised activities to promote the use of Free 
Software during the whole day. The artist Elektroll, decided to show 
his appreciation for Free Software projects with <a 
href="http://www.elektrollart.de/?p=4503">this wonderful artwork</a>. 
<a 
href="http://osb-alliance.de/news/berlin-sendet-eine-botschaft-zum-i-love-free-software-tag">OSB 
Alliance</a> informed about FSFE's activities and promoted love for 
Free Software on its page. In general, we would like to thank all the 
organisations who decided to promote "I Love Free Software" day, like: 
<a href="https://ansol.org/ilovefs2017">Ansol</a>, <a 
href="http://xarxanet.org/informatic/noticies/el-14-de-febrer-es-el-dia-mostrar-el-teu-amor-al-programari-lliure">Xarxanet</a>,

Today</a>, <a 
href="http://www.gizlogic.com/i-love-free-software-day-no-san-valentin/">Gizlogic</a> 
and many others. Some Free Software projects took the occasion to send 
a special ‘thank you’ to their hard working communities, like <a 
href="http://www.kdeblog.com/un-simple-gracias-tambien-ayuda-love-free-software-day-2017-ilovefs.html">KDE 
Spain</a>, <a

<p>Julia Reda, Member of European Parliament, did not miss the chance 
to show her support for Free Software by <a 
href="https://juliareda.eu/2017/02/ilovefs-haende-weg-von-limux/">calling 
out Munich to stay with LiMux</a>. Also Green MEP, Jan Philipp 
Albrecht, posted on twitter about his love for Free Software and the 
FSFE. In their website <a 
href="https://gruen-digital.de/2017/02/we-love-free-software/">GrünDigital</a>, 
the German Greens expressed their political support for the Free 
Software community. As did the <a 
href="https://www.piratenpartei-hessen.de/pressemitteilung/2017-02-14-i-love-free-software-tag-piraten-sind-mit-dabei">Pirate 
Party Hesse</a>, calling for the use of Free Software in public 
administrations.</p>

<p>In his blog, FSFE’s president, Matthias Kirschner <a 
href="https://k7r.eu/thanks-to-free-software-contributors-in-the-public-service/">dedicated 
his #ilovefs thank you to Free Software contributors in the public 
administrations</a>. Erik Albers, FSFE's community builder, prepared <a 
href="http://blog.3rik.cc/2017/02/free-software-ergo-sum/">a blog with 
nice memes of classic philosophers and their vision on Free 
Software</a>. While, Max Mehl, our Germany Coordinator, <a 
href="https://blog.mehl.mx/2017/i-love-astroid-ilovefs/">blogged about 
his new favourite email client, astroid</a>.</p>


<p>We hope all Free Software contributors out there feel even more 
motivated after this year's #ilovefs day. Our own conclusion? <a 
href="https://quitter.no/notice/3277117">"Build Free Software - Not 
walls"</a>, because in the Free Software world, different languages do 
not divide us. <a 
href="https://twitter.com/fsfe/status/831503330690158596">Instead, our 
love for freedom unites us all</a>.</p>

<p>
We encourage everybody to mark next year's February 14 as "I Love Free 
Software" day to continue this lovely campaign. Nevertheless, don't 
forget: each and every day is the perfect day to show your appreciation 
to Free Software and its contributors, by using, studying, sharing and 
improving it. </p>
