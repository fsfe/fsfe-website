    <title>AGNULA: A GNU/Linux Audio distribution</title>
    <description>
      The AGNULA project aimed at the creation of a fully functional, entirely
      Free Software GNU/Linux distribution for professional audio
      users. It is a project run by key players in the audio field
      with funding by the European Commission. The FSFE as a
      partner of this project is taking care of the legal issues, the
      long-term aspects and also making sure the Free Software
      community interests are heard.
