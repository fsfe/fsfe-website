The general assembly warmly welcomes the new members and regrets that
two of them could not personally receive the honor.


re 5. Pending exoneration of Peter Gerwinski, Head of Office (2001-2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HoO, Werner Koch, informed the general assembly that Peter
Gerwinski provided the requested information and documents after the
invation had been sent out.  The Extended Executive Committee accepted
these and therefore the pending exoneration became effective on April
2nd, 2004.


re 6. Miscellaneous
------------------

 - The HoO, Werner Koch provides an overview of the financial
   situation of the FSFE including current bank account status, last
   years income and expense.

   As all members have online access to the bookkeeping files at all
   times, the general assembly feels very well informed.

   The HoO informs that at the current state, operations can continue
   for the next five months unless more funds are raised and suggests
   that all members should make fundraising their priority.

 - The executive committee, Georg Greve gives a short overview over
   the work of last year and perspectives for the next. Among them:
   World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), European
   Commission, AGNULA, WIPO, Microsoft Case, new contacts:
   Switzerland, Greece, arte documentary, X.Org, GNOME Foundation in
   Germany, Legal FUD in Germany, Bookzilla.de, Bridge Foundation

   The future activities will include further WSIS activities,
   providing input and knowledge to other social movement civil
   societies and spreading awareness for and knowledge about Free
   Software and the visions for a globally networked Free Software
   community.

   Organizationally the FSFE had several major achievements during the
   past year, in particular being able to win Stefano Maffulli as a
   part time employee of the FSFE.

   The chair sees FSFE on a good course and expects it to solidify and
   grow further within the next year.

 - Now that the FSFE has three Austrian members, it plans to
   officially launch the Austrian chapter within the next months a
   formal association notwithstanding.

 - The general assembly considers that ways of rotating out members
   that have become inactive for longer periods of time in favor of
   new, active members may have to be found.


17:29. Closed by the chair.
