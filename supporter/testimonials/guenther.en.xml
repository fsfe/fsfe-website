	  I'm very impressed with what the FSFE has achieved on the EU and
	  national level. Back when I was working in the public sector I was
	  able to glimpse the vast amounts of money that are thrown at lobbying
	  for proprietary software and so called industry standards in Germany
	  and the EU. It's astonishing how the FSFE has still managed to get
	  itself heard. That is one of the reasons why I'm supporting the FSFE.
