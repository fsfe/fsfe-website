<h1>Sovereign workspace openDesk: German Ministry of the Interior provides answers</h1>

<p>The German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI) and the public IT 
service provider Dataport are working on administrative workspaces to 
enable digital sovereignty. But are both products Free Software? How 
are they related? We asked the BMI and publish the answers here.</p>

<p>In June, the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) sent a catalogue 
of questions to the BMI about its “Sovereign Workspace” project. <a href="/news/2023/news-20230606-01.html">Our 
questions</a> covered the relationship between the BMI workspace and Dataport's 
dPhoenixSuite, the funding of both projects, and the availability of 
their respective source code.</p>

<h3>New developments: openDesk code available, dPhoenixSuite still 
proprietary</h3> 

<p>Some weeks later, the BMI released the first source 
code of its workspace suite as Free Software on openCoDE, the code 
repository for public administration. According to extensive 
documentation, the release is an alpha version, with the first 
operational release planned for later this year. The documentation 
states that the suite will be released entirely under Free Software 
licences and will include modules such as Univention Corporate Server, 
Collabora Online, Nextcloud, OpenProject, XWiki, Jitsi and the Matrix 
client Element. Extensibility through new and alternative modules is 
planned. The suite was renamed "openDesk" a few weeks ago. As of 2024, 
the coordination and management of openDesk will be completely handed 
over to the Centre for Digital Sovereignty (ZenDiS GmbH). ZenDiS was 
founded at the end of 2022 to bundle the German government's digital 
sovereignty initiatives, and is fully state-owned.</p> 

<p>In contrast, Dataport has not yet released the source code for its 
workspace suite. The dPhoenixSuite contains numerous Free Software 
components and is advertised as "open source", "based on open source" 
and "digitally sovereign". This gives the false impression that 
dPhoenixSuite is Free Software. Dataport has not yet taken any steps to 
correct this impression or to actually make the suite available as Free 
Software.</p>

<h3>BMI: Dataport collaborates intensively on openDesk</h3> 

<p>Meanwhile, FSFE has received the BMI's response to our 
questions. The answers clarify that Dataport 
plays an important role in the development of openDesk, especially in 
the architectural design and operational development of the product, 
and receives public funding from the BMI for this. For 2023 alone, the 
BMI has earmarked 21.6 million euros for openDesk. However, it remains 
unclear what proportion of this funding is passed on to Dataport. There 
is also a lack of transparency about how much of the funding will 
actually go to the companies driving the development and integration of 
the modules used in openDesk.</p> 

<p>According to the BMI, there are overlaps between openDesk and the 
older dPhoenixSuite, which has mainly influenced the architecture of 
openDesk. However, the Ministry emphasises the independence of its 
openDesk suite: "The Sovereign Workspace is building its own 
architecture. [...] The Sovereign Workspace is an independent project. 
[…] To what extent Dataport aligns its dPhoenixSuite with it is up to 
Dataport". The BMI does not disclose to what extent dPhoenix code has 
been incorporated into openDesk. The Ministry states that it did not 
influence Dataport to make the dPhoenixSuite available as Free 
Software.</p> 

<p><a href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/Dataport_BMI_answers.pdf">The full BMI response can be found here</a>.</p>

<h3>Dataport must take a stand</h3> 

<p>So far, when asked about the dPhoenixSuite code, Dataport has referred to the source code of the 
included modules and to the BMI's openDesk project. The BMI's answers 
make it clear once again: Despite some similarities and organisational 
entanglements, dPhoenixSuite and openDesk are two different products. 
Dataport can no longer shift the responsibility for releasing its own 
source code onto the BMI, but must take a stand: if the dPhoenixSuite 
is to be a digitally sovereign workspace for public administrations, 
then Dataport should finally make the complete dPhoenix code available 
under a Free Software licence, ideally compliant with the openDesk 
reference implementation and not as a competing product.</p>

<p>However, BMI's response also contains a reference to possible 
proprietary components of the dPhoenixSuite. If Dataport continues with 
its proprietary strategy, and if the suite does contain proprietary 
code, it should no longer be advertised with the misleading terms 
"digitally sovereign" and "open source". In this case, Dataport should 
also correct the previous misleading communication by stating on its 
website that the suite is not Free Software to avoid any impression of 
open-washing.</p>

<h3>openDesk needs transparency and efficiency</h3> 

<p>Regarding the openDesk workspace, its funding and its links to the dPhoenixSuite, the 
BMI's answers only partially provide the necessary transparency. 
However, the publication of the openDesk code and its open development 
on openCoDE are important steps in the right direction. The 
documentation and announcements about the future of the openDesk 
project also give reason for cautious optimism that a fully-fledged 
Free Software workspace for administrations might soon be 
available.</p> 	

<p>In the future, the BMI and ZenDiS should not only manage the 
development of openDesk transparently, but also make the governance of 
the project transparent and understandable to the public – a 
prerequisite for openDesk to gain trust and acceptance in public 
administrations. Transparency is also the only way to ensure that public funds for 
openDesk are used efficiently and actually contribute to the 
development of Free Software. </p> 

<p>The FSFE has recently <a href="/news/2023/news-20230829-01.html">called on the 
German government to increase funding for Free Software instead of 
cutting it</a>, as is 
currently planned in the 2024 budget. Since openDesk is a major digital 
sovereignty project of this legislative period, there should be more 
budget for it, and that money should be used for actual Free Software 
development, feature implementation, maintenance, and integration of 
the modules. The BMI must finally make the organisational development 
of ZenDiS a priority and thereby secure Free Software projects for 
public administration in the long term.</p> 

<p><strong>The FSFE will continue to monitor developments around openDesk and 
the dPhoenixSuite. If you have any relevant information, you're welcome

<h3>Free Software and "Public Money? Public Code!”</h3> <p>Free 
Software gives everyone the right to use, study, share, and improve 
applications for any purpose. These freedoms ensure that similar 
applications do not have to be programmed from scratch every time and, 
thanks to transparent processes, others do not have to reinvent the 
wheel. In large projects, expertise and costs can be shared and 
applications paid for by the general public are available to all. This 
promotes innovation and saves taxpayers money in the medium to long 
term. Dependencies on vendors are minimised and security issues can be 
fixed more easily. The Free Software Foundation Europe, together with 
over 200 organisations and administrations, is therefore calling for 
“Public Money? Public Code!” - If it is public money, it should be 
public code as well. More information on the initiative is available on 
the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">“Public Money? Public Code!” website</a>.</p>
