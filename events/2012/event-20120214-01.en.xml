       As every year for Valentine's Day, the FSFE is planning an online
       campaign to celebrate this day as an "I love Free Software" - Day. <a
        href="http://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/2012/ilovefs.en.html">Our online
        campaign</a> aims at rising awareness to Free Software and the
       passionate, hard-working people behind it. You can participate in our
       campaign from all over the world. Show them that you appreciate their
       work â€“ it could make all the difference!
