<h1>CRA and NIS2: Protecting Free Software ecosystem in implementation
</h1>

<p>Together with NLnet Labs and the Open Source Security Foundation, 
the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE)  submitted feedback on the 
NIS2 implementation act, pointing to the need of protecting the 
European Free Software ecosystem.</p>

<p>The NIS2 implementation act, with its cyber security regulations and 
implementing decisions, is also addressing Free Software ecosystem in 
Europe. It is therefore crucial that these measures, while contributing 
to cyber security, do not hamper Free Software development, especially 
as Free Software is a strong component in the cyber security area.</p> 

<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
“It is important to recognise the special nature of 
Free Software development and the Free Software ecosystem and its role 
in the software supply chain. Implementation needs to be proportionate 
and effective”, states Alexander Sander, FSFE.
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>In this sense, the FSFE, together with <a 
href="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/">NLnet Labs</a> and the <a 
href="https://openssf.org/">Open 
Source Security Foundation</a>, <a 
href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14241-Cybersecurity-risk-management-reporting-obligations-for-digital-infrastructure-providers-and-ICT-service-managers/F3471997_en">jointly 
provided feedback</a> to the consultation on the European Commission’s 
draft NIS2 
Implementing Act concerning "Cybersecurity risk management &amp; reporting 
obligations for digital infrastructure, providers and ICT service 
managers" (launched on 27 June). </p> 

<p>We raised our concerns about the focus on business to business (B2B) 
relationships. Complex software products, which are at the core of 
services of the digital infrastructure sector of NIS2, are often 
published by independent individuals, not-for-profit actors or academic 
organisations. In this case, beyond the freedoms granted by Free 
Software licences, no relationship exists between developer ('direct 
supplier') and an entity in scope for NIS2.</p>

<p>The FSFE actively participates in regulation processes such as 
consultations, <a href="/news/2023/news-20230323-01.html">attends hearings</a> 
and is in close dialogue with decision-makers in the EU to make sure cyber security 
regulation does not hamper Free Software development. If you are 
negatively affected by the implementation of CRA and NIS2, please 
<a href="mailto: contact@fsfe.org"> contact us</a>.</p>
