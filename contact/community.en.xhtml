  <h1>Community</h1>

  <h2>Public Discussion</h2>

  <p>The FSFE provides infrastructure to foster public discussion on 
  Free Software topics. Everybody is encouraged to freely state their 
  opinions on these platforms, but please keep the <a 
  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1855.txt">netiquette guidelines</a> 
  in mind.  In particular be aware that discussions inside the FSFE's technical infrastructure are covered by our <a href="/about/codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</a> that kindly asks all participants to be excellent to each other.</p>
  <p>Opinions voiced in the public discussion are not official 
  positions of the FSFE.  For official statements see our <a 
  href="/contact/press.html">press release lists</a> or <a 
  href="/contact/contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="mailinglist">Mailing Lists</h3>

  <p>
   We have a number of mailing lists for local groups as well as thematic
   teams. You can find a complete list of the public lists on our
   <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/">mailing list server</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="discourse">Discourse - Forum</h3>
  
  <p>We are experiencing with <a href="https://community.fsfe.org">Discourse</a>, a forum-like discussion platform, as a volunteer-run service provided by the FSFE but still in a beta phase. It serves as a test case for specific topics and will be evaluated over time whether it fits in the FSFEâ€™s communication setup and mission. You are welcome to become part of this new service and help us improving it.</p>

  <h3 id="irc">Internet Relay Chat and XMPP Rooms</h3>

  <p>We have an XMPP-Chat-Room where we can meet:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Server: conference.jabber.fsfe.org</li>
    <li>Channel: community</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Other channels can be found with the room search of your XMPP client.</p>
