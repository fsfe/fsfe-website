   <title>Protecting your innovations, CeBIT, Hanover, Germany</title>
   <body>
     <p>
  Some people argue that you have to protect innovations. FSFE's Vice
  President Matthias Kirschner attends a panel discussion organised by
  the European Patent Office which discusses several ways how to
  approach this aim. The topics range between copyright methods,
  software patents, and their implications for Free Software. The event
  takes place in hall 8 from 16:30 until 17:15 and is in English.
