		<h1>Request Business Cards</h1>

		<div class="field-annotation right">
			"Business cards must answer
			<br />the following questions:
			<br />Who is this?
			<br />Who is represented?
			<br />What is he/she doing there?
			<br />How can I reach him/her?"
			<br />(Matthias Kirschner)
		</div>

		<p>
		The purpose of this form is to avoid unnecessary,
		duplicate work. In the past, the process "production
		of business cards" has often triggered a minimum of 10 emails
		(but often enough far more) per person per set of
		cards. The main problem was usually the lack of correct, complete data.</p>

		<h2>Generally</h2>

		<p>
		In general, everyone on team@ is eligible for FSFE business cards.
		If you are not on team@, or are unsure whether it makes sense for
		you to order business cards, please contact
		<a href="mailto:contact@fsfe.org">contact@fsfe.org</a>.
		</p>

		<h3>Language</h3>

		<p>
		English is default. If you need cards in another language
		for good reasons, we have to produce two sets of cards.
		Please use the form below twice in this case.
		</p>

		<h2>Contents of the card</h2>

		<form action="/cgi-bin/businesscards.pl" method="post">
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>

						<h3>1. First name and surname</h3>

						We use the international form with all parts in lower cases with a
						leading upper case for each word.  If there are very good reasons
						to use another form, i.e. printing the surname in upper cases, as
						it is common in France, this should be done in the localised
						version of the cards, not in the international version.
						Data might include middle initials, but no nicknames (e.g. as
						used in IRC).

					</td>
					<td>
						<input type="text" size="50" name="name" placeholder="name" required="required" />
						<div class="field-annotation">
						Joe Average
						<br />Joe M. L. Average
						<br />Joe Martin Average
						<br />Dr. Joe Average
						<br /><del>Joe "Coolface" Average</del>
						<br /><del>Joseph AVERAGE</del>
						<br /><del>Average, Joseph</del>
						</div>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>

						<h3>2. Your title (or function)</h3>

						A title/function should be mentioned. It might be generic, somehow, i.e. "German Team".
						<br />If you are an intern, please use "Assistant to the President" as your title.
						You can leave the field empty as well.
						</td>
						<td>
						<input type="text" size="50" name="function" placeholder="title" required="required" />
						<div class="field-annotation">
							Coordinator of $group
							<br />Intern

					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					<h3>3. The line "Free Software Foundation Europe"</h3>

					</td>
					<td>
					Free Software Foundation Europe
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>

					<h3>4. Address</h3>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>

					<h3>5. Tel. (optional)</h3>

					When working at an FSFE office, the number of that office
					should be mentioned. If not, it might be your own number
					or left empty. If in doubt, ask the others.  The number
					should be grouped by two or three digits, seperated by
					spaces.

					<td>

					<h3>6. Mobile (optional)</h3>

					The mobile phone number you would like to appear on your card., e.g.

					<br />You should be reachable by phone. So as a minimum 5. <em style="font-weight:bold; font-style:normal;">or</em> 6. should be filled in.

				<tr>
					<td>

					<h3>7. Fax (optional)</h3>

					communications protocol. If you absolutely want to include a fax
					number, please use the same format as the phone number.
					</td>
					<td>
					<label>fax +</label>
					<input pattern="[0-9 ]*" size="25" name="fax" />

					<h3>8. Email</h3>

					<td>
					<h3>9. Jabber (optional)</h3>

					Your FSFE jabber address. (You don't know that you have a jabber

					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>

						<h3>10. Fingerprint</h3>

						The fingerprint of your GnuPG key. No, not the key ID, not
						the kind of your key.
						<br />(You do not have a GnuPG key? Something went
						terribly wrong.) You can generate this fingerprint with the following command in a terminal:
						<br />
						<code>$ gpg --fingerprint [yourKeyID]</code>

					</td>

							<small>2F77 A3E7 70E5 C802 2295 87D6 B8B7 8D13 B4BA 019E</small>
							<br />(This is a theoretical example. It won't work!)
						</div>

					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>

					<h3>11. URL</h3>

					There is no need to mention an URL. "www.fsfe.org"
					will be printed on the reverse side automatically.

					</td>
					<td>
					www.fsfe.org
					</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>
					<h3>12. Amount of cards</h3>

					</select>
					</td>
				</tr>


				<tr>
					<td colspan="2">

					<h2>What happens now?</h2>

					<h3>13. Preview</h3>

            You will receive a proof sheet to your fsfe.org email address, so
            you can check whether all the information on it is correct. Please
            check it directly and tell us if there is something wrong.
          
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>

					<h3>14. Delivery address</h3>

					We will send the cards to the address
					which is printed on the cards, by default.
					<br />If you want us to send them elsewhere, tell us the
					other address, please.
					</td>
					<td>
					<textarea cols="40" rows="5" name="delivery_address" />
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2">
					If <em>all</em> required data is <em>available and correct</em>,
					and you are quick to approve it, you will receive your cards
					within 5 to 10 days, depending on the snail mail systems. Our
					all-time record is 24 hours. If problems occur (incomplete or
					incorrect data etc.), the delay might turn out to be hellish.  Our
					all-time record is 6 months.
