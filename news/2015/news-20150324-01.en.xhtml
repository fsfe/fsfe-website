	<h1>Worldwide more than 50 events about Open Standards</h1>
            
	<p newsteaser="yes">On March 25 is this year's Document Freedom Day and,
 depending on your time zone, it has already started. Document Freedom 
Day is the global campaign for document liberation by local groups 
throughout the world. So far more than 50 groups registered their events
 in over 25 countries ranging from Asia, Europe, Africa, to South and 
North America.</p>
	
    
	<p>Open Standards are crucial to ensure that different computer systems
 can work together, and that users can access documents regardless of 
the computing platform or device they use. They are the foundation of 
the Internet and the World Wide Web as well as all kinds of technical 
communication.</p>
	
	
	<p>Every year, on the last Wednesday of March and the days around, 
people highlight these important aspects of our digital sovereignty by 
celebrating Document Freedom Day. In 2015, Document Freedom Day is 
happening around the world beginning on Tuesday 24, 12 UTC until 
Thursday, 12UTC. Following the path of the sun, the first events are 
happening in Japan, Taiwan and India, followed by more than 20 events in
 Europe, 1 in Africa, and more than 20 in North- and South America. 
Taken together, all these events make DFD the biggest campaign to 
promote Open Standards on a local level.</p>
	
	<p>And Document Freedom Day is growing even beyond: In the past years, 
Document Freedom Day achieved to establish a view on technological 
boundaries and freedoms under social aspects. More and more, Document 
Freedom Day is becoming a day to raise political attention also on a 
national or global level. In 2015, different organisations will use 
Document Freedom Day to publish and spread political statements. If you 
are not close to any event or you miss the time to pass by, watch out 
#DFD2015 in the news, blogs and media, participate, and help to get the 
world interconnected in freedom.</p>
	
	<p>You can still participate: use this day to invite your friends or 
work mates for a drink or a coffee break and tell them about the 
international day of Open Standards and why Open Standards are important
 to you - and for everyone.</p>
