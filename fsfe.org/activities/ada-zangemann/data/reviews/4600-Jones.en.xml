      "A wonderful book that explores the worlds of two very different characters. While their backgrounds and lifestyles couldn't be more different, there is something they both have in common... their love for technology. Ada &amp; Zangemann highlights themes of access, collaboration, and community - and shows how the combination of all three can literally change the world around you."
