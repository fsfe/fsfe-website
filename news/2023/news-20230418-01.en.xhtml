	<h1>Lithuania: Students stop university from using only proprietary authentication</h1>

	<p>Vilnius Tech officials attempted to enforce the use of proprietary 
	two factor identification (2FA) methods. Some students were concerned 
	the methods would compromise privacy and could not be  run in their 
	devices, and proposed an alternative way to get the authentication. 
	Finally, the university reversed its decision.</p>

	<p>Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU), a public university 
	in Lithuania, recently attempted to make 2FA methods mandatory for 
	access to its platforms. The problem came when some students noticed 
	that the available methods would make the platforms inaccessible to 
	those who did not wish to use proprietary tools. Students using phones 
	run by Free Software would lose access to their university tools, such 
	as email. So they demanded open standards and Free Software. After 
	weeks of student complaints, and with no official explanation, the 
	measure was reversed. In a symbolic act, one student even hacked the 
	university’s GitLab instance and reported it to the IT department. 
	</p>

	<h3>University attempted to lock out students who use Free Software phones</h3>

	<p>On 14th February an email was sent out to all students and staff, 
	instructing them to configure 2FA within two weeks, or they would not 
	be able to access university services. What raised concerns was that 
	the system set up by VGTU only allowed two options for 2FA, Microsoft 
	Authenticator (app notifications) and SMS.</p> 

	<p>While there is nothing wrong with enforcing 2FA, the methods mandated by VGTU are proprietary and 
	privacy-compromising. Microsoft Authenticator is proprietary software, 
	meaning that users are not allowed to study, share, and improve the 
	code without restriction. In addition, the app was only available on 
	two platforms: Android with Google Play services or iOS, meaning that 
	people using alternative Free Software App stores were locked out. The 
	alternative SMS option required users to share their phone number and 
	personal information with Microsoft, which also made students 
	uncomfortable. 
	</p>

	<h3>No way to evade it</h3> 
	<p>Several students demanded that VGTU also allow open standards and Free 
	Software. The “app passwords” option, which is normally built into 
	Microsoft Authenticator, was not available. This would have allowed 
	students to access their university email from other clients without 
	2FA. The “Configure app without notifications” option, which would have 
	allowed the use of other password managers/authenticators, was also 
	unavailable. Since the university disabled alternatives, the only 
	option for the university community was reliance upon Microsoft.</p>

	<p>Some students contacted the IT Helpdesk requesting that the TOTP (time-based 
	one-time password) option be enabled. However, the IT department 
	claimed that their systems were not designed to support such 
	authentication. The department stated that two-factor authentication 
	options were currently available, SMS and the Microsoft app, and that 
	the use of TOTP could be considered in the future. In short, the IT 
	department did not listen to these students’ demands. 
	</p>

	<blockquote>
	  <p><em>"This university has a bad habit of enforcing proprietary software and doing 
	  little research on the free alternatives. Free software has always been 
	  better and easier to use. It's hard to study when you can't agree with 
	  invasive EULAs," states Zehra Irem Kuyucu, one of the affected students.</em>
	  </p>
	</blockquote>


	<h3>Raising the anti-discrimination argument to the university 
	community</h3> 
	<p>The students then went on to raise their concerns to 
	other members of the university community, including the Deputy 
	Manager, the Students Office, and the Department of Information 
	Technologies. They pointed out that the study agreement did not require 
	them to have a working phone running Google Play services or iOS. 
	According to Lithuanian law, educational institutions  cannot 
	discriminate against students on the basis of their social status or 
	beliefs, and the University's 2FA restrictions could discriminate 
	against students who refuse or are unable to install a proprietary 
	application on their personal devices. 
	</p>

	<h3>Silent victory: access to services, student GitLab hack</h3> 
	<p>After students who could not configure 2FA had been blocked for 
	about a week, the university community was able to access their email 
	again on 27 March. No one was notified of the change. The university 
	didn’t offer a one-time password option for 2FA.

	<p>
	A few days later, one of the students, Zehra Irem Kuyucu, even went one step 
	further. She resorted to drastic measures by <a 
	href="https://gitlab.digilol.net/Siren/vgtu-article/-/blob/master/vgtu.md">hacking 
	the university's GitLab instance</a>. She explained that she wanted to “teach what 
	their infrastructure is worth, as another bad habit they have is poor 
	security, despite authoring articles about it”. Then she sent an email to the IT department with security advice. She has, on other occasions, also reported problems regarding 
	other parts of their infrastructure, such as HTTP plain-text 
	authentication or poor wireless network security. 
	</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>The use of two factor identification methods 
	helps to secure devices and data but it should be implemented in a way 
	that is not locking anyone out. VGTU's mandate for 2FA only gave the 
	option of using proprietary software, raising concerns to some students 
	who did not want to compromise their privacy. The university's decision 
	to disable options that would have allowed students to access their 
	university email using other clients without 2FA was unfair, as it left 
	students with no options but to use Microsoft Authenticator or to share 
	their phone number and personal information with Microsoft. The IT 
	department's refusal to enable TOTP as an option was also not 
	satisfactory, as it meant that students who did not have devices 
	compatible with Microsoft Authenticator were discriminated against. 
	While the university claimed that TOTP use would be considered in the 
	future, there was no timeline for when this would happen.
	</p>

	<p>After students who could not configure 2FA had been blocked for about a week, 
	the university silently retreated. The university community was able to 
	access their email again on 27 March.
