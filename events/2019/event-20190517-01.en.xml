    <body>
      <p> IT-tinkering is only possible with Free Software, that's why the FSFE is going to be present with an information and merchandise booth at the Maker Fair Berlin from 17.05.2019 until 19.05.2018. On Friday 17 May, the Maker Fair is open for school classes and their teachers, free of charge. The Maker Fair is a get-together of makers and visitors interested in various DIY-ideas. At the FSFE’s booth, visitors can inform themselves about Raspberry Pi as a computer for standard applications especially suitable for education, about how to ‘free’ Android-Smartphones and about email-encryption. </p>
