    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
        FSFE is a charity dedicated to empowering users to control technology.
        Together with our community we form a movement to build freedom in
        digital society. There will never be enough space to shed light on all
        the creative minds and motivated people who helped us grow and share
        our mission. Still, we like to highlight at least some of our priceless
        community members who in one way or another shaped the FSFE's profile
        to help us become what we are now.
