<h1>FSFE Newsletter - July 2011</h1>

<h2>Attack on Free Software and the GNU GPL</h2>

<p>Imagine you bought a computer with pre-installed Free Software. After
a while you decide to install some additional software made by someone
else. The company that sold you your computer does not like this
however, and decides to sue the people who made the additional software
that you installed. Sounds like maybe buying your computer from that
company was not such a good idea!</p>

<p>At the moment something very similar is happening in <a
  href="http://fsfe.org/news/2011/news-20110620-01.en.html">an important
  GNU GPL violation case in Germany</a>, in which FSFE and <a
  href="http://www.gpl-violations.org">gpl-violations.org</a> are
participating. AVM maintains in court that others should not be allowed
to modify software on computers bought from them,
including the Linux kernel. Although the Linux kernel is distributed
under the GNU GPL which guarantees exactly this freedom to users.</p>

<p>AVM is attacking the very foundations of Free Software: They
want to take away freedom from others. It will directly <a
  href="http://laforge.gnumonks.org/weblog/2011/06/24/#20110624-avm_cybits_gpl_fud">
  contravene the legal rights of the original authors</a> of the
programs who decided that software freedom and cooperation is more
important to them than directly receiving license fees. If AVM is
successful in court it will be disastrous for Free Software on embedded
devices, including mobile phones, network hardware, and other Free
Software based products.</p>

<p>The court made no decision during the last hearing on June 21st. The
participants may yet file further written pleas.  On 27th September the
court will either make a ruling on the case directly, or choose to begin
hearing evidence.  FSFE and gpl-violations.org have published a <a
  href="/projects/ftf/avm-gpl-violation.en.html">detailed report about
  the case</a>, and will continue to monitor it and defend the freedom
of software users.</p>


<h2>FSFE Internal: An era ends - others start</h2>

<p>Usually you do not hear about the people who work behind the scenes for
FSFE. This is because most of them are volunteers, and the press and publicity
work is handled by people like our president <a
  href="/about/gerloff/gerloff.html">Karsten Gerloff</a>, or your editor. But
those volunteers give up their spare time to promote software freedom, and
without them FSFE would not be what it is today.</p>

<p>At FSFE's General Assembly which took place in Ljubljana, Slovenia,
on June 11, <a href="/about/members.html">FSFE's members</a> elected <a
  href="http://sandklef.com/hesa">Henrik Sandklef</a> as Vice President.
A computer scientist and GNU Hacker from Gothenburg, Sweden, Henrik has
been active with FSFE since 2005. He takes over from Fernanda Weiden,
who held the volunteer position for the past two years. The General
Assembly also confirmed Karsten Gerloff as FSFE's President, and
Reinhard Müller as Financial Officer.</p>

<p>During that weekend an era ended, as Bernhard Reiter, co-founder of
FSFE, completed ten years as German coordinator and Deputy. He was the
first FSFE representative to continuously hold positions for so long
within the organisation, and also the only person to participate in all
of FSFE's annual General Assemblies.  Bernhard will remain active within
FSFE, but has now handed the official post of Deputy German Coordinator
to <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/torsten.grote/">Torsten Grote</a>.</p>


<h2>The European Commission’s locked-in syndrome</h2>

<p>It is official: The European Commission will migrate to Microsoft
Windows 7 without considering alternative solutions. In a reply to
questions asked by MEP Bart Staes (Greens/EFA), the European Commission
confirmed that it has awarded contracts for the 'upgrade' to Microsoft
and reseller Fujitsu-Siemens on behalf of 55 other European institutions
and the Commission itself. As Karsten explains in his <a
  href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/gerloff/2011/06/06/the-european-commissions-locked-in-syndrome/">
  blog article</a>, this move will drive the EC into even greater
dependence on Microsoft.</p>

<h2>Get active: Become an FSFE booth volunteer in Strasbourg</h2>

<p>We will take part at the RMLL, one of the biggest Free Software events in
France, from July 9th to 14th. FSFE will have a booth there, and also give
presentations. Karsten will give a talk on Centralised Internet Services and
Problems of Power (13.07., 15:20), France Coordinator <a
  href="/about/roy/roy.html">Hugo Roy</a> will talk about the battle fought by
Free Software for HTML5 online videos, and we have also invited several other
speakers to talk about topics around the decentralisation of the Internet.</p>
  
<p>Like for every other booth, contact us and help us to inform the
audience about Free Software, and our work.</p>

<p>Regards,<br/>
