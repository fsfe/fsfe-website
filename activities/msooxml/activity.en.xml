    <title>MS-OOXML</title>
    <description>
      Since the beginning of the standardisation process for Microsoft's Office 
      Open XML - OOXML (hereafter MS-OOXML), the FSFE has raised serious doubts 
      about whether MS-OOXML can be considered open. FSFE was the first to raise 
      the issue in the community, led the movement against the standardisation 
      of MS-OOXML, and has been closely following developments over the years.
