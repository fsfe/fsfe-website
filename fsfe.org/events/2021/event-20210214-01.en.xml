        <title>Wikipedia Weekly Network - LIVE Wikidata editing #31 #ilovefs (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>Wikidata users Ainali and Abbe98 are doing some live editing on Wikidata (in English), and discuss their thought process of what they are doing and why they do it. In this episode, since it is I Love Free Software Dayâ€‹, they will both look at Free Software already described in Wikidata and also how you can add more to Wikidata. You need no prior knowledge of Wikidata to follow along in this episode. Sunday, February 14, 19.00 UTC.<br />
