      Below is a side-by-side comparison of discussion draft 1 and
      discussion draft 2 of GNU GPL version 3.  Text that was in the first
      draft but which is not in the second draft is
      in <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">bold red</span> in the
      left column, and text which is new in the second draft is
      in <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">bold blue</span> in
      the right column.  The section numbers used in version 2 of the GNU
      GPL are shown in square brackets.

          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
          agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
          License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
          License.  If you cannot convey the Program, or other covered work,
          so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
          License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
          you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you

          <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">agree to terms that
          obligate you to collect a royalty for
            further conveying from those to whom you convey the

          both <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">those
            terms</span> and this License would be to refrain entirely from
          conveying the Program.
