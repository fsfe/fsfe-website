<p>
  Today we are celebrating Women’s Day. Thank you to everyone who is 
  making the tech sector more inclusive! Let’s continue working 
  together to achieve gender parity and embrace equity. There  might be 
  problems coming our way, but we also have each other. Join us and 
  meet the FSFE Women team.

  Many women (as well as other under-represented groups) still have to 
  ask for security and equal opportunities in the workplace and in 
  other areas of their lives. Women and diversity bring different 
  skills, viewpoints, and experiences to the workforce. To thrive we 
  need women in technology and in Free Software, both as developers and 
  as part of our movement. In 2018, women made up <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2018.pdf">only 22% of AI 
  professionals worldwide</a>, and in 2021 they made up only <a href="https://www.zippia.com/computer-systems-manager-jobs/demographics/">16% 
  of computer systems managers in the US</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Women should be involved in shaping our digital infrastructure, 
  bringing their own ideas to solve collective problems. It is 
  paramount to harness women’s talent while building technology that 
  addresses their needs. They should also have a voice in key 
  decisions. We invite everyone to join us in making technology an 
  inclusive space that improves our society.

<h3 id="join-fsfe-s-women-group">Join FSFE’s Women group</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Women/">FSFE Women group</a> 
  was created to help women -and everyone who identifies as female-  to 
  make connections and go deeper into technological issues. FSFE Women 
  meets online every month to discuss different topics  related to Free 
  Software. The group is women-focused and open to inter, trans and 
  non-binary people as well. You can join the group:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>through its <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#women:fsfe.org">Matrix chat room</a>, </li>
  <li>join the FSFE Women <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/fsfe-women">mailing list</a>,</li>
  <li>drop by the FSFE Women’s next team meeting Monday the 20th of March 2023 <a href="https://conf.fsfe.org/b/women">starting at 8 pm CET</a>, or</li>
  <li>contact the FSFE <a href="/about/people/partsafyllidou/">community coordinator</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  One of the activities of this group has been compiling a <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Women/Groups">list of Women groups 
  in Free Software</a> to increase networking and lead those who want 
  to code to existing Free Software programs.

  Moreover, the Women group has contributed to the FSFE wiki page with

    &quot;If we want technology to serve society rather than enslave 
    it, we have to build systems accessible to all people -be they male 
    or female, young, old, disabled, computer wizards or 
    technophobes.&quot;

<p>
  Access to technology is a crucial aspect of achieving gender equality 
  and creating a more democratic society. Technology must be at the 
  service of everyone. And Free Software can respond directly to 
  people&#39;s needs. Because it allows users to adapt it to their 
  needs, it is a powerful tool to develop and bring technology to 
  populations that lack coding skills.
</p>

<p>
  Free Software can help close the gender gap. The use and development 
  of Free Software, by providing accessible digital tools, supports the 
  process of digital transformation and provides women and other 
  under-represented groups with digital skills and the opportunity to 
  develop their own software according to their needs.
</p>

<p>
  For all the amazing potential of technology to be useful <a href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index#gatekeeper-control-monopoly-devices">it 
  must be unrestricted</a>. We need <a href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index.html#device-neutrality-free-software">Device 
  Neutrality</a>, for example, so that users can install and uninstall 
  any software they want.

<p>
  We need software that does not restrict the users. With Free Software 
  we can use a program fully without restrictions or trials, and we can 
  understand, adapt, and share its code. We need software freedom.

<p>
  The FSFE has implemented a <a href="/about/codeofconduct">code of conduct</a> 
  clarifying that in our communication channels people are expected to 
  behave excellently towards each other. We formed a <a href="/about/codeofconduct">Care Team</a> so that if 
  you have experienced or become aware of behaviour contrary to the 
  principles enshrined in this Code of Conduct, you can report it 
  there. We have also taken <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/KnowHow/FSFELife/DiversityMeasures">measures 
  to improve diversity</a> within the FSFE.

<p>
  In the Free Software movement we try to combine our work for software 
  freedom with fun times. Stay strong and restless, but do not hesitate 
  to chat with our community if you are just interested to meet 
  like-minded people.
