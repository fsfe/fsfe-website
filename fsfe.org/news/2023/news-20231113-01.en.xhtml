<h1>Interoperable Europe Act: an ambition that turned out to be watered-down</h1>

<p>Decision makers are meeting to agree on the final text of the 
Interoperable Europe Act (IEA). There is a concerning wording related to 
giving priority to Free Software when implementing interoperable 
solutions and confusing criteria to do so. Overall, what could have 
been a very ambitious initiative turned out to be another regulation 
with ambiguous and problematic wording.</p>

<p>The FSFE has received exclusive access to the the <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/documents/version-trilogue131123-1.pdf"> 
final agreement of the IEA </a> which will be agreed on tonight, on 13 
November. We welcome that there is a clear definition of Free Software 
licenses, as well as the intention to monitor the development of Free 
Software interoperable solutions in the public sector.</p>

<p>There is, nonetheless, an especially concerning wording in the text 
when it comes to the sharing and reusing of interoperability solutions 
(Art4(5a)). The draft text suggests that public administrations should 
prioritise Free Software when deciding on the implementation of 
interoperability solutions. However, the way the final text looks is 
problematic for two reasons:</p>

<p>The wording <em>"solutions that do not carry restrictive licensing 
terms, such as open source solutions"</em> implies that there are other 
solutions that do not carry restrictive licensing terms apart from open 
source licenses. If so, which ones would those be? This is indeed not 
clear in the text and this leads to legal uncertainty.</p>

<p>Since this specific wording can become extremely misleading, it is 
particularly important to highlight this problematic loophole. To 
serve as an example, we have the well-known fact that FRAND licensing 
terms - that in theory stand for "fair, reasonable, and 
non-discriminatory" terms - in practice are <a 
href="/freesoftware/standards/why-frand-is-bad-for-free-software.html">incompatible 
with most of Free Software</a>. In the past, we have already criticised 
the stance of the Commission on such licensing and we have also pointed 
out that in fact FRAND licences cannot be considered fair, reasonable 
nor non-discriminatory.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the European Commission has watered down the already 
ambiguous wording of this article by limiting the situations in which 
public administrations shall prioritise Free Software interoperable 
solutions by adding the following criteria: <em>"when equivalent in 
functionalities, total cost, user-centricity, cybersecurity or other 
relevant objective criteria".</em></p>

<p>This wording undermines a regulation that aims to make the sharing and 
reuse of solutions a more common practice among public administrations. 
By adding this criteria to allow public administrations to actually 
refuse to use Free Software solutions, the Commission is going in the 
opposite direction of the <a href= "/news/2023/news-20230323-02.html" > 
"Free Software first" approach </a> that this legislation needs. </p>

<p>Wording as <em>"other relevant objective criteria"</em> brings back, 
once again, the constant problematic tendency of the Commission to 
limit Free Software and its adoption by adding ambiguous and unclear 
wording. It also shows a lack of ambition which could have led it to 
become a real game changer.</p>

<p>By adopting this position, the European Commission is also falling 
short of its own ambitions, already defined in documents such as the 
<a 
href="/news/2020/news-20201023-01.html"> Open Source Strategy </a>
and the ’Decision on the open source licensing and reuse of Commission 
software’. Therefore, it is deeply concerning that the European 
Commission is now pushing back by turning on the opposite direction. 
</p>

<p>Last but not least, unfortunately, the chance for other stakeholders 
to be part of the governance structure, specifically on the Board, has 
been removed from the final text, being currently only up to the Chair 
to decide if an expert can join the Board as an observer. </p>

<p>That is why the role of the Free Software community is crucial to 
monitor the implementation of the IEA, while highlighting the 
importance of Free Software for achieving interoperability in the 
European digital public services.</p>
