    <h1>Radio stations granted awards for using Open Standards</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">Berlin/Vienna March 24. The Free Software Foundation Europe
awarded Deutschlandradio and Radio Orange with the Document Freedom Day 2010 Prize
for using Open Standards and promoting them in society. FSFE's German
team together with the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure 
(FFII) will present the DFD cake displaying "rOGG on!" in Berlin
and Cologne to Deutschlandradio.  The Austrian DFD cake goes to the
Vienna-based station Radio Orange 94.0.</p>

<p>Deutschlandradio and Radio Orange provide live streams of their programmes in
OGG Vorbis format. Open Standards like OGG Vorbis enable data transfers between
software of different vendors.  By allowing
data to be transmitted independent of any particular software vendor, they leave
users free to use different types of hardware or software.</p>

<p>The Xiph.org foundation designed the OGG Vorbis format as a patent-free alternative to
MP3 for compressing audio files. In contrast to proprietary formats, Open
Standards can be easily used with Free Software. This makes Open Standards
indispensable to the media, administration, companies, organisations, and
PC users.</p>

<p>FSFE is pleased that both radio stations set standards for the freedom of
their listeners by using Open Standards.</p>
