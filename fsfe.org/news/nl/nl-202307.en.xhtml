<h3 id="Cyber-Resilience-Act-First-committee-backs-FSFE-demand-to-protect-Free-Software">Cyber Resilience Act: First committee backs FSFE demand to protect Free Software</h3>

<p>The Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee (IMCO)
launched a landmark decision to protect Free Software developers in the 
Cyber Resilience Act (CRA).</p>

<h3 id="IEA-EU-Parliament-advances-in-strengthening-the-role-of-Free-Software-yet-needs-more-to-improve">IEA: EU Parliament advances in strengthening the role of Free Software, yet needs to improve...</h3>
 
<p> The two EP Committees for opinion, IMCO and LIBE, <a href="/news/2023/news-20230629-02.html">have adopted 
their texts on the Interoperable Europe Act</a>. While both recognise the 
importance of Free Software for this regulation, the inclusion of the 
Free Software community in the Board remains uncertain. The wording on 
proper monitoring and evaluation goes in the right direction.</p>

 
<h3 id="And-Council-to-exclude-relevant-stakeholders-from-contributing-to-an-Interoperable-Europe">...and Council to exclude relevant stakeholders from contributing to an Interoperable Europe</h3> 

<p> The current draft from the Council on the Interoperable Europe Act 
is limiting the Interoperable Europe Board, and with this excluding 
relevant stakeholders from contributing to a 
more interoperable and innovative Europe. There is also a lack of 
improved wording in the area of monitoring and budgeting.

<h3 id="Artificial-Intelligence-EU-Majority-for-AI-Act-and-safeguards-for-Free-Software">Artificial Intelligence: EU: Majority for AI Act – and safeguards for Free Software</h3> 

<p>The European Parliament voted in favour of the AI Act with 499 votes 
in favour, 28 against, and 93 abstentions. Free Software is given 
safeguards; these rules must now be defended in the inter-institutional 
negotiations (also known as trialogue in which representatives of the 
Parliament, the Council and the Commission agree on an final text) and 
transferred to the Cyber Resilience Act and the Product Liability 
Directive.</p>

<h3 id="Germany-questions-about-status-of-dPhoenix">Germany: questions 
about status of dPhoenix</h3>
<p>A Free Software office and collaboration suite for the public sector is one of the projects with 
which the German government aims to fulfil the goals of the coalition 
agreement in relation to Free Software. But a closer look at the 
project <a href="/news/2023/news-20230606-01.html">raises the question 
whether our long-term demands for 'Public Money? 
Public Code!' are actually met</a>.

<h3 id="Youth-Hacking-4-Freedom-second-edition-ended">'Youth Hacking 4 
Freedom' second edition ended</h3>

Hacking 4 Freedom contest has just ended. Almost 70 teenagers from all 
over Europe registered for this second edition that will have its award 
ceremony in October.</p>
