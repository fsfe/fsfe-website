<h1>"YH4F encourages young students to be brave and resilient"</h1>

<p>Youth Hacking 4 Freedom would not be possible without the amazing 
teenagers who join this contest, our incredible sponsors and donors, 
whose support is vital, and our expert jury, who evaluate the projects. 
One of these jury members is Brielen Madureira, who talked with us  
before the  participants have to submit their projects.</p>

<p>16 professionals with a different focus on Free 
Software come together as the <a href="/activities/yh4f/jury">Youth 
Hacking 4 Freedom (YH4F) jury</a>. They cover a wide range of technical 
aspects – 
from a focus on large language models, to leading major Free Software 
projects and kicking of innovations in their field of expertise. This 
diversity ensures that, regardless of the type of project submitted, 
there is always an expert available to review it and offer valuable 
feedback to the participants.</p>

<p>We have talked with one of our jury 
members, Brielen Madureira, a Doctor in Computational Linguistics from 
the University of Potsdam, and interested in evaluation and ethical 
considerations of language technologies… and birds!</p>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: Thanks Brie for talking with us. What inspired you to become a
jury member for this competition? </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Brie</strong>: The fact that it is an amazing educational
initiative. It encourages young students to be brave and resilient,
gives them an opportunity to use and improve their knowledge while
building useful software and, in the end, rewards them (and us) with a
trip and tasty food : )</p>
</div>


<div>
<blockquote>
Based on the jury’s scores, the six winning projects receive a cash
prize ranging from €1,024 to €4,096. The winners are invited (with all
expenses covered) to the award ceremony held over a weekend in October
in Brussels.	
</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE: What do you enjoy most about being involved in this
kind of event? </strong></p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Brie</strong>: Witnessing how bright young programmers are,
how much they learn during the process (even on their own!) and the
amazing, well-articulated projects that they can develop. </p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: If you had to choose only one, what would be your favourite
thing about this competition?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Brie</strong>: It gives visibility and networking
opportunities to the participants.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: What skills do you think are most important for participants to
take part in this competition? </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Brie:</strong> Knowing how and when to look for help and
resources in order to overcome problems in coding, being able to change
gear and reshape the project when needed, having the ability to think
beyond the code itself and be aware of its benefits and limitations in
relation to future users.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE: Have you seen any common mistakes or challenges among
the participants?</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Brie</strong>: Lacking documentation. It is very
disappointing to open a repository that may contain an awesome and
well-developed idea which is not well communicated or explained. It gets
harder to judge its quality and usefulness without knowing how it works,
what it can be used for, how to install it and so on.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE: What impresses you the most in a project? </strong></p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Brie</strong>: Seeing it has an outstanding documentation and
that it provides a solution to a problem that can potentially benefit a
whole community. Even better when the views of that community directly
influenced the development of the solution.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE: Why do you think this programming competitions is
important for teenagers?</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Brie</strong>: In school, we learn how to read and write in
our own language and possibly in other natural languages, but not
everyone has the chance to learn a programming language from early on.
This competition is an incentive for young students to seek that
knowledge and see that it can create great things. Besides, it is
important to incentivise the principles of Free Software among young
programmers.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE: What advice would you give to young programmers who
want to improve their skills?</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Brie</strong>: Refactor your own code, review other people’s
code and contribute to Free Software repositories. Learn the best
practices and the native style of your preferred programming language.
Stay up to date with the latest developments in the community. Talk to
and get feedback from the users of your tools. And always document your
code well.</p>
