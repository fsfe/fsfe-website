  <h3>Decide yourself what you code</h3>

  <p>
    There is no set challenge or topic for the software you should develop.
    Embrace your imagination and create what is the most interesting to you. It
    can address an everyday problem you have, or it can be just fun. It can be a
    standalone program that you write from scratch, or you can modify and
    combine existing programs. <a href="/activities/yh4f/faq.html#what-type-of-software-should-i-make-">The
    possibilities are endless</a>. A vital condition for the competition is that
    the program should be <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free
    Software</a>, so that others can use, study, share, and improve the code in
    the future. <strong>Do not worry, if you do not have an idea yet!</strong> We will be there and help you to come up with an idea. Or you have the chance to meet other participants and to join their team.
  </p>

 <h3>Take the time you need</h3>

  <p>
    During the <a href="/activities/yh4f/faq.html#2-coding-phase">programming
    period</a> you have the chance to develop your project idea and work on the code or hardware. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to meet other participants from across Europe in our monthly calls. You can <a href="/activities/yh4f/register">register</a> from 1st of July till 30th of June, for the upcoming YH4F programming competition. For YH4F 2025 you can now <a href="/activities/yh4f/register">register</a> and we will reach out to you before the competition starts on the 1st of January 2025. If you are not yet sure whether you want to take part, or if you have any questions about registration, you are welcome to contact us at <a href="mailto:yh4f@fsfe.org">yh4f@fsfe.org</a>.</p>

  <h3>Present your program to top experts</h3>

  <p>
    Your software project will be in good hands, as it will be evaluated by Free
    Software experts. <em><a href="/activities/yh4f/jury.html">Our jury
    members</a></em> excel in software development and are deeply involved in
    the Free Software movement. At the same time, they are excellent people to
    work with. After you submit your program, you will have the chance to
    present it to them, as part of your evaluation. This is a nice opportunity
    for you to discuss your idea and your achievement with experienced people in
    the field.
