    <title>FSFE not fooling around: Join the Fellowship and win a Free Software notebook!</title>
    <body>
FSFE's way to say thank you for the support: Like last year's PDA,
donated by xtops.de the Free Software Foundation Europe will be
raffling off two HP notebooks to all active Fellows on 1 April this
year. For two lucky Fellows, April Fool's Day will be anything but
foolish.
