00:00.000 --> 00:17.960
Welcome to the fifth episode of the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:17.960 --> 00:21.320
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.120
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.120
I'm Matthias Kirschner.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.680
I'm the President of the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:28.720 --> 00:31.200
I'm doing this podcast today with Katarina Nokun.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.040
Hello.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.880
We are very happy to welcome today Lauren Slasik.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.200
He's the inventor of creative comments

00:37.200 --> 00:41.080
and a former board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

00:41.080 --> 00:44.080
He was also on the board of our sister organization

00:44.080 --> 00:46.200
with the Free Software Foundation.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.680
And he just recently published a new book.

00:48.680 --> 00:52.040
They don't represent us, we're claiming our democracy.

00:52.040 --> 00:56.520
And he's the author of the book Code and Adder Laws of Cyberspace from 1999,

00:56.520 --> 00:59.080
which was for myself the most influential book

00:59.080 --> 01:01.200
for my thinking about software freedom.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.120
Nice to have you in our podcast.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.920
We are very happy to have friends to get a slot with you.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.480
And we are huge fans.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.960
We read your books.

01:08.960 --> 01:13.680
And when we prepare for the podcast or when we prepare for the question,

01:13.680 --> 01:16.880
I ask myself all those specific moments in your life

01:16.880 --> 01:22.880
when you realize that software freedom is important to you.

01:22.880 --> 01:28.360
Well, I don't pretend that I had this insight

01:28.360 --> 01:31.920
before hearing Richard Stallman talk.

01:31.920 --> 01:36.520
And so Richard Stallman, when I don't remember exactly whether it was

01:36.520 --> 01:38.120
I had read something and then saw him speak

01:38.120 --> 01:39.760
or it saw him speak and then read something.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.640
But the point is that was the experience

01:42.640 --> 01:47.240
that forced me to begin to think about the character

01:47.240 --> 01:50.560
of the infrastructure of this social world

01:50.560 --> 01:54.280
that was being constructed by technology.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.080
And so that was the cause, that was the trigger.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.640
And that then led me to think about a lot of things

02:00.640 --> 02:04.800
which produced that book and then a bunch of stuff afterwards.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.640
In this book which is Code and Adder Laws of Cyberspace,

02:08.640 --> 02:12.720
you explain how individuals are regulated by different mechanisms.

02:12.720 --> 02:18.320
Though you separate between the market, social norms, law and architecture,

02:18.320 --> 02:21.760
can you briefly explain how these kinds of regulation

02:21.760 --> 02:25.240
differ from one another and how they affect us in our daily life?

02:25.240 --> 02:27.680
Right, so the law is the one that's most intuitive.

02:27.680 --> 02:32.120
If you have a sense that it says if you speed, you will be penalized

02:32.120 --> 02:35.840
or if you commit murder, you will be sent to jail.

02:35.840 --> 02:40.920
So this is an ex-post punishment, punishment after the fact,

02:40.920 --> 02:43.200
imposed by the state.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.720
But you can distinguish that from norms.

02:45.760 --> 02:51.200
So if you're in a society that's governed by significant norms,

02:51.200 --> 02:54.520
the norms also are subject to punishment.

02:54.520 --> 02:58.040
If you violate the norms, but their punishment comes from the community,

02:58.040 --> 02:59.160
it doesn't come from the state.

02:59.160 --> 03:02.600
So it's decentralized enforcement of that rule.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.320
So both of them are rules, but ones can force by the state,

03:05.320 --> 03:07.400
ones in force by our community.

03:07.400 --> 03:11.320
The market, of course, which itself is constructed by law and norms,

03:11.320 --> 03:13.640
I don't mean to say that they're not intermixed,

03:13.640 --> 03:18.200
but the market sets the conditions on you having access to certain things.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.960
So if I sing, you'll pay me a certain amount.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.120
If I sing less, you'll pay me more, right?

03:23.120 --> 03:25.280
Because if I sing, it's just like that.

03:25.280 --> 03:29.200
But the point is there's a conditionality, which is the price,

03:29.200 --> 03:31.360
and that's the way the market regulates.

03:31.360 --> 03:35.760
And then the one that's most important in thinking about the internet

03:35.760 --> 03:39.440
is the way that architecture can regulate.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.320
So in real space, we understand that whenever you go over a speed bump,

03:43.320 --> 03:45.560
speed bump is trying to force you to slow down.

03:45.560 --> 03:50.880
It's using the physics of automobiles and roads to do that.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.240
Lecture halls don't typically have beautiful windows

03:54.240 --> 03:56.440
that you can look at and see what's going on the outside,

03:56.440 --> 04:00.280
because professor wants you to be focused on the professor.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.120
Those are uses of architecture in real space,

04:03.120 --> 04:06.840
but when you think about that and you see the way the net is,

04:06.840 --> 04:11.800
you can begin to recognize that the net is architected, too.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.520
It's architected to enable certain things,

04:14.520 --> 04:15.880
and to disable certain things.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.840
And when the internet was first architected,

04:18.840 --> 04:21.160
it was architected to enable innovation.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.920
It was architected to enable privacy.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.720
It was architected to enable free speech.

04:25.720 --> 04:29.400
And the creativity that would create.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.760
And the point of my book code was to say,

04:31.760 --> 04:36.080
all of those characteristics were contingent.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.600
We can imagine the internet being architected

04:38.600 --> 04:41.400
to take away the opportunity to innovate,

04:41.400 --> 04:44.600
to take away privacy, to take away the capacity

04:44.600 --> 04:47.120
to engage in free speech, take away the opportunity

04:47.120 --> 04:49.680
for creativity on top.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.040
When I wrote that, people said, oh, no, no, no.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.200
You're misunderstanding it's the nature of the net.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.280
It has to protect these things.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.360
And my point was there's no nature here.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.360
It's just built.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.720
It could be built differently.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.800
And the governments in business have an incentive

05:02.800 --> 05:04.400
to build it differently.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.960
Governments in business want a world

05:06.960 --> 05:11.120
where innovation can be controlled in favor of the incumbents.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.040
Where privacy is gone, because we

05:13.040 --> 05:15.840
surveil you in no exactly what you think and care about.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.160
So we can sell things to you or punish you.

05:19.160 --> 05:22.240
Where speech is conditional, like your freedom to speak,

05:22.240 --> 05:24.520
can be punished based on what you say.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.600
And where creativity is regulated

05:26.600 --> 05:30.320
to control by the creator, maybe the copyright holders

05:30.320 --> 05:31.440
and the like.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.040
So that was the point of the recognition

05:34.040 --> 05:35.440
of the way architecture regulates.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.880
But the general point, which we continue

05:37.880 --> 05:40.040
to use outside of the study of cyber law,

05:40.040 --> 05:42.480
the general point about how they interact

05:42.480 --> 05:43.600
is the important point here.

05:43.600 --> 05:47.840
So you want to regulate smoking, which I want to regulate,

05:47.840 --> 05:49.760
because I think it's a terrible, terrible thing.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.240
You know, the law could forbid people

05:52.240 --> 05:53.960
under the age of 18 from smoking

05:53.960 --> 05:57.240
and in most many places in the states it does.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.440
The law could try to stigmatize smokers.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.880
California had an extraordinary campaign

06:01.880 --> 06:04.280
where they tried to make smokers seem like weak people,

06:04.280 --> 06:05.520
like pathetic people.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.680
So it was like rallying norms against smokers.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.520
You can use the market to regulate smoking.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.040
You can tax cigarettes.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.320
Of course, we tax cigarettes and we subsidize tobacco

06:14.320 --> 06:15.160
in the United States.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.720
It's a little confused, but the point is,

06:16.720 --> 06:19.600
you can make it so the price makes it harder to smoke.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.720
And you can regulate the architecture of cigarettes.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.240
The FDA for a while was considering

06:24.240 --> 06:27.400
deeming cigarettes nicotine delivery devices

06:27.400 --> 06:29.680
so that they would be drugs so that they could regulate

06:29.680 --> 06:31.600
the quantity of nicotine that was in a cigarette.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.320
And if you could lower the nicotine,

06:33.320 --> 06:35.480
you would lower the addictiveness of the cigarettes.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.520
The point is, regulators kind of think of those things

06:37.520 --> 06:38.560
together.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.640
And always get it to say, what's the right mix?

06:40.640 --> 06:42.440
Like, should I use architecture?

06:42.440 --> 06:43.440
Should I use law?

06:43.440 --> 06:44.720
Should I use norms?

06:44.720 --> 06:47.360
Or how do I bring them all together?

06:47.360 --> 06:49.800
Do you have other examples of how government

06:49.800 --> 06:52.040
are regulating with architecture?

06:52.040 --> 06:55.520
I mean, if software or other architecture as well?

06:55.520 --> 06:57.280
Well, sure.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.080
In real space, there are great regulations

07:00.080 --> 07:01.640
the government makes about architecture.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.240
For example, the physically disabled

07:04.240 --> 07:07.200
have enormous freedom now relative to what they had

07:07.200 --> 07:09.720
50 years ago, because governments have regulated

07:09.720 --> 07:11.480
literally architecture of buildings to say,

07:11.480 --> 07:13.440
you can't build a building unless you have ramps

07:13.440 --> 07:16.920
or you have access for people who are in wheelchairs.

07:16.920 --> 07:21.240
Or you build it so that ATM so that blind people can use the ATM.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.640
So those are specific regulations directed at that.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.520
And the internet context, we're seeing all sorts of eagerness

07:28.520 --> 07:31.520
to regulate in the context of the emergence of blockchain

07:31.520 --> 07:33.760
technology, because there's a fear of governments

07:33.760 --> 07:37.400
that's the opportunity of a generalized

07:37.400 --> 07:40.320
like Ethereum-like blockchain technology

07:40.320 --> 07:43.120
could begin to displace a lot of a sovereignty

07:43.120 --> 07:45.520
or sovereign power of governments.

07:45.520 --> 07:50.000
And in the context of the war on, quote, war on terror,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.280
there's significant evidence that the government explicitly

07:53.280 --> 07:57.240
required technology companies to build technical backdoors

07:57.240 --> 08:01.640
into their security technologies

08:01.640 --> 08:04.400
to enable the government to get in, in case there were

08:04.400 --> 08:05.960
some reason the government had to be in.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.240
Now, of course, what that did was render

08:08.240 --> 08:11.200
most of these technologies vulnerable to Chinese hackers.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.840
So businesses in the United States who believe

08:13.840 --> 08:15.960
they bought, quote, security software

08:15.960 --> 08:18.080
have found that they've bought insecurity software

08:18.080 --> 08:20.920
because it's been architected to be insecure.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.360
But those are imperfect examples.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.920
The methodology, though, I think is certainly what we think

08:25.920 --> 08:28.960
is the future of regulation.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.440
As a user, I often don't know what a certain software

08:32.440 --> 08:35.280
exactly does on my computer because the code itself

08:35.280 --> 08:37.520
is regarded as a business secret.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.560
Do you think that a such a generous structure

08:40.560 --> 08:43.760
of how software is built in our society

08:43.760 --> 08:47.400
and how it is protected by copyright and patents

08:47.400 --> 08:50.400
also affects the general distribution of power

08:50.400 --> 08:52.320
in a digitalized society?

08:52.320 --> 08:53.920
Absolutely.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.680
So the most obvious troubling example of this

08:56.680 --> 09:01.320
is, for example, California is contracting out

09:01.320 --> 09:05.440
with technology companies for AI technologies

09:05.440 --> 09:07.840
to help decide whether somebody should stay in prison

09:07.840 --> 09:09.480
or somebody should get parole.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.280
These algorithms look at a billion different things

09:12.280 --> 09:15.400
and then you decide you should get out and you should not.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.840
When civil rights, civil liberties advocates

09:18.840 --> 09:21.160
have said, what's the algorithm?

09:21.160 --> 09:22.920
How's the algorithm making that decision?

09:22.920 --> 09:24.280
Like, what are the factors?

09:24.280 --> 09:25.960
The companies have said, we're not going to tell you.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.320
It's a trade secret.

09:28.320 --> 09:32.920
And astonishingly, so far there's no strong position

09:32.920 --> 09:35.680
from the government or from the courts to say, you can't do that.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.480
You can't regulate with secret rules.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.680
Yet that's effectively what they're doing.

09:40.680 --> 09:44.400
So I'm not sure I would go so far as saying

09:44.400 --> 09:48.080
that you should not permit proprietary software.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.680
I certainly support free software,

09:49.680 --> 09:52.320
but I'm not sure we should ban proprietary software.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.720
But I would say that if there is software

09:55.760 --> 09:58.720
that is effectively regulating, especially

09:58.720 --> 10:01.200
through the government, we need to have a way

10:01.200 --> 10:03.280
to understand how it's regulating.

10:03.280 --> 10:08.360
And so whether that's building sophisticated auditing

10:08.360 --> 10:10.920
structures like we have financial auditing,

10:10.920 --> 10:14.600
you can imagine technology audits that have a capacity

10:14.600 --> 10:18.280
for evaluating what's going on or requiring source code

10:18.280 --> 10:19.240
to be revealed to somebody.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.240
I don't know exactly how to do it, but I do know the principle.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.680
There can't be regulation of people in a free society

10:25.680 --> 10:28.360
that can't justify itself.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.680
And proprietary software that is being used to determine

10:31.680 --> 10:34.560
whether you get out of jail or not is regulating us

10:34.560 --> 10:36.960
without justifying itself, and that can't be allowed.

10:36.960 --> 10:41.200
I mean, this example of our judges in some US states

10:41.200 --> 10:43.400
make decisions as Emmy for us Europeans

10:43.400 --> 10:45.880
is very clear that you should forbid such a thing

10:45.880 --> 10:49.120
or even you should not allow to do such things.

10:49.120 --> 10:53.160
But do you think it makes also a general difference of code

10:53.160 --> 10:55.360
that is used by government institutions

10:55.360 --> 10:59.520
is proprietary or free software in other contexts?

10:59.520 --> 11:03.640
So I think it's stupid for governments

11:03.640 --> 11:07.440
to deploy proprietary code in most important governmental

11:07.440 --> 11:08.400
function contexts.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.560
And the reason for that is most of the functions

11:11.560 --> 11:13.200
that governments perform around the world

11:13.200 --> 11:15.400
are pretty redundant.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.160
I mean, you've got welfare systems in every major country.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.760
They all figure out who's entitled to a welfare who's not.

11:20.760 --> 11:21.560
How do you distribute it?

11:21.560 --> 11:23.320
You have social security systems.

11:23.320 --> 11:27.080
You have systems for checking imports, whatever.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.680
It would be much better to be in a world

11:29.680 --> 11:34.080
where you opted into the free software of those systems

11:34.080 --> 11:37.720
and could build and add to the free software of those systems.

11:37.720 --> 11:42.720
So that the advantages that are embedded in any place

11:43.240 --> 11:45.840
that this is being deployed get shared everywhere.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.280
That would be an ecology that would be

11:48.280 --> 11:51.240
in the long run better, more robust and cheaper.

11:51.240 --> 11:55.720
The problem is that too many government policy makers

11:55.720 --> 11:59.240
don't have any clue about the underlying technologies.

11:59.240 --> 12:03.840
And it always is the, we used to say, 30 years ago,

12:03.840 --> 12:07.480
the simplest decision was to choose IBM.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.200
The simplest decision today is to choose Microsoft.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.840
Like who could disagree with choosing Microsoft?

12:12.840 --> 12:16.000
But obviously, there are so many advantages

12:16.000 --> 12:18.040
to beginning to move in a direction

12:18.040 --> 12:21.240
that is enabling more competition

12:21.240 --> 12:24.920
and free software is obviously one of those dimensions.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.680
When I argue for software freedom,

12:26.680 --> 12:29.640
some people sometimes say, we don't need more regulation

12:29.640 --> 12:32.320
because I think it's, I'm talking about regulating

12:32.320 --> 12:33.160
in this aspect.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.840
And I think it's a strange aspect

12:34.840 --> 12:37.400
because there are already lots of regulation

12:37.400 --> 12:39.160
in favor of proprietary software

12:39.160 --> 12:42.240
like governments often support keeping the workings

12:42.240 --> 12:45.120
of software secret by forbidding to analyze

12:45.120 --> 12:47.440
how it works in publishing results.

12:47.440 --> 12:51.440
They grant monopolies on long copyright terms on software

12:51.440 --> 12:53.760
and they allow software to be patented.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.200
Do you think that we have too much

12:56.200 --> 12:58.320
or just a wrong kind of regulation in place

12:58.320 --> 13:00.200
when it comes to software?

13:00.200 --> 13:03.160
Well, I certainly think that in the context of copyright,

13:03.160 --> 13:05.800
which is what I know in this field

13:05.800 --> 13:07.480
of so-called intellectual property,

13:07.480 --> 13:09.640
obviously Richard Solomon would be very upset

13:09.640 --> 13:11.920
with that word, but in that field,

13:11.920 --> 13:13.320
I know a lot about copyright.

13:13.320 --> 13:17.240
It's certainly the case that copyright is a regulation

13:17.240 --> 13:21.000
that is wildly more punitive and expansive

13:21.000 --> 13:24.840
than it needs to be to achieve its own objectives.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.320
The copyright term now is life of the author

13:27.320 --> 13:29.600
plus 70 years in the United States

13:29.600 --> 13:32.480
for 95 years for corporate works.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.760
There is no corporation that decides whether or not

13:35.760 --> 13:39.280
to invest in a project based on getting a return

13:39.280 --> 13:40.880
for 95 years.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.000
Nobody does that.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.480
And even worse is where you have countries

13:44.520 --> 13:47.440
which basically Europe just went through this craziness,

13:47.440 --> 13:50.760
extending the term for existing copyrights.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.440
If the purpose of a copyright is to create an incentive

13:53.440 --> 13:57.960
to produce something, not even the EU parliament

13:57.960 --> 14:01.120
can create the incentive to do something in the past.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.600
So no matter what, George Gershwin

14:03.600 --> 14:05.080
is not going to produce anything more.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.840
So there's no reason to extend the copyrights

14:06.840 --> 14:08.720
from the 1920s and 1930s.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.880
Yet this seems like an automatic thing to policy makers

14:11.880 --> 14:14.560
because again, they have this image that property is good

14:14.560 --> 14:16.600
and more property is better.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.520
That is wrong in a thousand ways

14:18.520 --> 14:21.760
when we talk about the regulation of called copyright.

14:21.760 --> 14:27.000
And I think a good dose of libertarian anti-government instinct

14:27.000 --> 14:28.840
would do a lot of good here, right?

14:28.840 --> 14:30.480
So if you want to be anti, you know,

14:30.480 --> 14:33.320
this is where, you know, I'm not a libertarian,

14:33.320 --> 14:36.240
but I find a lot of allies who are libertarians

14:36.240 --> 14:39.440
anti-government types about copyright regulation

14:39.440 --> 14:40.600
because they can see.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.400
It's just basically crony capitalists

14:43.400 --> 14:46.120
capturing a corrupted political process

14:46.120 --> 14:48.320
to leverage their power into protecting

14:48.320 --> 14:51.520
their own against future competitors.

14:51.520 --> 14:55.320
And even beyond competition,

14:55.320 --> 14:57.480
they're protecting against criticism

14:57.480 --> 15:01.400
or use of their work in ways that they don't like the speech

15:01.400 --> 15:03.080
component as it relates to them.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.800
And I just, you know, can't begin to see

15:05.800 --> 15:07.560
what the justification for that is yet

15:07.560 --> 15:10.360
we still have governments that do it again and again.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.560
In your recent work,

15:12.560 --> 15:16.760
you often address the problem of lobbying and corruption.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.440
And would you say that without the lobbying efforts

15:19.440 --> 15:22.880
of companies such as Disney, me, today might have

15:22.880 --> 15:26.440
a totally different copyright regime as we have now?

15:26.440 --> 15:27.440
Of course we would.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.120
And the evidence for that is that, you know,

15:30.120 --> 15:31.920
until there was the heavy lobbying

15:31.920 --> 15:34.040
in the United States around copyright extension

15:34.320 --> 15:37.640
in the mid-1970s, the general view,

15:37.640 --> 15:39.680
the general length of copyright and the general view

15:39.680 --> 15:41.560
about copyright was very balanced.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.960
It was not, there was no extremists like you have today.

15:44.960 --> 15:49.040
And the extremism was built by this incredibly powerful

15:49.040 --> 15:52.520
industry which spent an enormous amount of money

15:52.520 --> 15:55.200
basically buying off members of Congress,

15:55.200 --> 15:58.720
not in a crude corrupt way, nobody bribes anybody.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.400
But just by creating this atmosphere

16:00.400 --> 16:03.600
where it just seems obvious that you would support

16:03.680 --> 16:06.560
massive protections called copyright.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.120
And I think that, you know, what we have to do

16:09.120 --> 16:12.240
is to build obviousness in the other way

16:12.240 --> 16:16.720
and force them to justify their regulations on my speech.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.280
You begin to see this back and forth

16:19.280 --> 16:21.960
developing in a productive way around YouTube.

16:21.960 --> 16:25.800
So for example, you know, YouTube develops

16:25.800 --> 16:29.840
and the copyright extremists are angry at YouTube

16:29.840 --> 16:31.760
because there's so many copyright violations

16:31.760 --> 16:33.600
they say going on on YouTube.

16:33.600 --> 16:37.000
So YouTube and Google developed this technology content ID

16:37.000 --> 16:40.320
that is basically able to take fingerprints of

16:40.320 --> 16:44.520
copyrighted music and then compare it to any content

16:44.520 --> 16:45.800
that's uploaded on YouTube.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.400
And then give a notice to the person who uploads

16:48.400 --> 16:50.640
the copyrighted content that, you know,

16:50.640 --> 16:52.320
we're gonna take your stuff down

16:52.320 --> 16:53.760
or we're gonna monetize your stuff

16:53.760 --> 16:55.360
because you violate the copyrights.

16:55.360 --> 16:59.600
Okay, so, you know, I've had many fights

16:59.600 --> 17:01.680
where I will upload a lecture,

17:01.680 --> 17:04.320
where in the middle of a lecture I will do a demonstration

17:04.320 --> 17:06.520
of like some point I'm making about copyright

17:06.520 --> 17:08.160
and I will use a snippet of a song

17:08.160 --> 17:11.320
and that snippet will be caught by content ID

17:11.320 --> 17:13.120
and they'll say we're gonna take your lecture down.

17:13.120 --> 17:15.120
It happens in Germany all the time.

17:15.120 --> 17:19.120
Germany is the most extreme, outrageous black box copyright.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.520
I can't use the word fascist in Germany

17:22.520 --> 17:24.360
but, you know, the point is that's what we would call it

17:24.360 --> 17:25.880
in the United States.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.240
But it happens in Germany all the time

17:27.240 --> 17:30.200
and it seems natural to them, that's the way it should be.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.920
Now, for me, you know, it doesn't matter

17:31.920 --> 17:35.040
because my livelihood does not depend on YouTube.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.240
I don't get money for my stuff being put up there

17:37.240 --> 17:39.640
and run ads against my stuff, so that's fine.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.480
But there are these creators who are building YouTube channels.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.440
There was a really great one recently

17:44.440 --> 17:47.280
where this guy who basically teaches guitar lessons

17:47.280 --> 17:50.560
on using YouTube and he'll do these demonstrations

17:50.560 --> 17:53.560
of techniques and, you know, he's very careful

17:53.560 --> 17:57.240
not to copy songs, but he'll do like four or five bars

17:57.240 --> 17:58.520
to show a certain technique.

17:58.520 --> 18:01.680
And those four or five bars will then be attributed

18:01.680 --> 18:04.120
to some copyright owner and then he's informed

18:04.120 --> 18:06.960
that all of the advertising rammative from his videos

18:06.960 --> 18:10.000
will be given to the collective who then just,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.760
and of course, that means as he can't produce,

18:12.760 --> 18:16.160
he can't be a creator and what good is coming from this?

18:16.160 --> 18:17.520
I mean, it's not even copying.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.240
He's not even saying, here's the Beatles.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.640
Let me tell you how the Beatles play.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.880
It's, here's an opening of blah, blah, blah that, you know,

18:23.880 --> 18:26.960
every single artist in history of guitar has used,

18:26.960 --> 18:30.200
but just because it now is in the content ID database,

18:30.200 --> 18:33.080
he can't do it or do it and make any money from it.

18:33.080 --> 18:37.000
This is stifling new creators to benefit

18:37.000 --> 18:39.240
these collecting rights societies or to benefit

18:39.240 --> 18:42.240
these old monopolists and there's no justification for it.

18:42.240 --> 18:47.440
When we transform this debate to the whole free software debate,

18:47.440 --> 18:50.240
some people argue that we need software patents

18:50.240 --> 18:52.560
in order to protect products from being copied

18:52.560 --> 18:56.080
and that the current system encourages investments

18:56.080 --> 18:57.480
in innovation.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.920
What do you think about this argument?

18:59.920 --> 19:03.240
Well, it's a theoretically good argument

19:03.240 --> 19:05.120
in the sense that it fits the form

19:05.120 --> 19:06.960
of why we would want patents.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.680
You know, we want patents where it's creating

19:09.680 --> 19:12.520
an incentive to invest that otherwise wouldn't be there.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.360
So this fits the form.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.360
It turns out not to be true though, right?

19:16.360 --> 19:18.800
You don't need patents in the context of software

19:18.800 --> 19:21.040
to create the incentive to make the software.

19:21.040 --> 19:25.320
And we don't have an absence of software innovation

19:25.320 --> 19:27.480
where we have an absence of software patents.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.360
In fact, it's to the contrary,

19:29.360 --> 19:32.360
where you've got a field of software patents.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.320
What that does is concentrate software innovation

19:35.320 --> 19:37.960
in companies that can afford the lawyers necessary

19:37.960 --> 19:40.200
to defend against the patent claims.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.000
And we've seen this not just in software,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.480
we've seen this in agribusiness, for example.

19:44.520 --> 19:49.440
As you've created patents on agricultural innovations,

19:49.440 --> 19:52.480
the only companies that can afford to be in the business

19:52.480 --> 19:57.040
are companies that can aggregate all these patent portfolios

19:57.040 --> 19:58.160
so that when they're in a fight,

19:58.160 --> 20:01.520
they have like 10,000 patents to launch against

20:01.520 --> 20:04.200
your 2,000 patents and you'll have to give into them.

20:04.200 --> 20:08.920
It's all a game of consolidation and support

20:08.920 --> 20:12.200
for these big businesses that want to stifle the opportunity

20:12.200 --> 20:13.280
for new innovators.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.280
So we imagine the internet was going to be the space

20:15.280 --> 20:17.720
where anybody anywhere could become a coder.

20:17.720 --> 20:21.040
Well, until you code something, that's worth something,

20:21.040 --> 20:22.800
and then you've got to confront the patents

20:22.800 --> 20:24.080
that are running on this code.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.560
And it's not that you've copied anything from anybody

20:27.560 --> 20:29.640
because patent law doesn't require you copy,

20:29.640 --> 20:32.680
a copy readily, you have to affirmatively copy something.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.320
But patent law, if you just are practicing

20:34.320 --> 20:36.720
the same invention that somebody else has patented,

20:36.720 --> 20:38.120
even if you came up with it yourself,

20:38.120 --> 20:39.760
you still are violating the patent.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.920
So you come up with a great new technology,

20:41.920 --> 20:42.840
you want to deploy it,

20:42.840 --> 20:45.080
you then have to hire a patent firm

20:45.080 --> 20:46.520
to be able to clear the patents.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.920
If there are other patents reading on your invention,

20:48.920 --> 20:50.840
then you've got to negotiate for the right to do that.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.000
Well, if you're just a software developer,

20:53.000 --> 20:54.400
you can't negotiate.

20:54.400 --> 20:55.760
You don't have any leverage.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.560
So you have to sell it to a company

20:57.560 --> 21:00.880
who then can leverage because they have their own patents.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.080
Who is this benefiting?

21:03.080 --> 21:04.520
It's not benefiting innovation.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.320
It's just benefiting the opportunity

21:06.320 --> 21:08.760
to consolidate these large companies

21:08.760 --> 21:12.800
as the Uber innovators.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.160
And obviously, I think that stifles

21:15.160 --> 21:17.160
the opportunity for innovation.

21:17.160 --> 21:20.080
Then one last question from my side.

21:20.080 --> 21:21.600
How would a society look like

21:21.600 --> 21:23.760
when we don't have those software patents

21:23.760 --> 21:26.240
and all the code out there regulating people

21:26.240 --> 21:28.040
would be free software?

21:28.040 --> 21:30.800
Well, I think if you didn't have a software patents,

21:30.800 --> 21:33.560
you'd have an opportunity for a wider range of innovators.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.200
I just think intuitively more innovation

21:36.200 --> 21:38.080
is better in this space.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.680
If it were free software that were regulating people,

21:40.680 --> 21:45.160
the opportunity to surface the improper regulations

21:45.160 --> 21:46.120
would be greater.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.800
The opportunity to challenge regulations

21:48.800 --> 21:50.360
that were improper would be greater.

21:50.360 --> 21:54.760
And you would feed an industry of kind of lawyer types

21:54.760 --> 21:58.720
who could begin to test whether this type of software regulation

21:58.720 --> 22:01.800
is consistent with the values of a society.

22:01.800 --> 22:05.000
Now, fortunately now we have many more lawyers

22:05.000 --> 22:08.680
who are actually technologists, too, actually coders as well.

22:08.680 --> 22:13.200
If we had a platform open for them to investigate

22:13.200 --> 22:14.520
the way they can go investigate

22:14.520 --> 22:17.160
whether a bureaucracy is following the law,

22:17.160 --> 22:20.600
I think we could begin to force the infrastructure

22:20.600 --> 22:24.640
of regulation called code to conform more fundamentally

22:24.640 --> 22:27.000
to the values that we say are fundamental

22:27.000 --> 22:29.640
values of a society.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.320
So now my last question.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.480
Imagine you could travel back in time

22:33.480 --> 22:36.720
and change history, in which time would you travel

22:36.720 --> 22:38.840
and what would you like to change?

22:41.920 --> 22:46.640
Well, you know that since 2007, since Anne Aaron Swartz

22:46.640 --> 22:49.280
sort of forced me to give up my work on copyright

22:49.280 --> 22:52.600
and the internet and take up this corruption work

22:52.600 --> 22:54.280
at a corruption of our democracy.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.120
That's been my obsession.

22:56.120 --> 22:59.480
So it's about a dozen years now that this is what I've been

22:59.480 --> 23:00.920
thinking about every day I wake up.

23:00.960 --> 23:04.640
I'm publishing my sixth book about this year.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.080
So I want to solve that problem

23:06.080 --> 23:08.200
because I'm tired of fighting it.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.800
So what would I do to solve it?

23:09.800 --> 23:13.360
Well, you know, we could go back in any number of places

23:13.360 --> 23:17.800
and talk about inserting into our constitution

23:17.800 --> 23:19.800
something I think the framers of our constitution

23:19.800 --> 23:24.080
took for granted, which is that everyone is an equal citizen

23:24.080 --> 23:26.560
with equal political rights.

23:26.560 --> 23:29.080
Because every problem with the American democracy right now

23:29.080 --> 23:31.160
is a problem of equality.

23:31.160 --> 23:36.400
So the way we fund campaigns with a tiny fraction

23:36.400 --> 23:40.520
of the 1% funding the campaigns that candidates gather

23:40.520 --> 23:45.320
to get to office is in inequality of political power.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.040
The way that systems are gerrymandered

23:47.040 --> 23:49.720
is in equality of political inequality of political power.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.640
The way votes get suppressed if you happen to be black

23:52.640 --> 23:54.760
or if you happen to be a Democrat and a Republican state

23:54.760 --> 23:57.120
is in inequality in political power.

23:57.160 --> 24:00.280
These are all ways that we've allowed a core promise

24:00.280 --> 24:04.480
of a representative democracy that it is equal to be corrupted.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.440
So I would at any number of points,

24:06.440 --> 24:10.360
we could say I have a 1787 or 1936

24:10.360 --> 24:12.440
or when the 14th Amendment was passed,

24:12.440 --> 24:16.080
I would just add three or four words into those texts

24:16.080 --> 24:19.840
that would have made this fundamental point enforceable

24:19.840 --> 24:22.680
so that we wouldn't live in this deeply corrupted

24:22.680 --> 24:24.640
so-called democracy that still pretends

24:24.640 --> 24:26.360
like it's the greatest democracy in the world

24:26.360 --> 24:31.360
yet is corrupted the core commitment of a democracy.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.000
Larry, thank you very much.

24:34.000 --> 24:34.720
Thank you for your time.

24:34.720 --> 24:35.720
Thank you for your work.

24:35.720 --> 24:39.520
I am such an admirer of the work of the Free Software Foundation

24:39.520 --> 24:42.120
especially the work in Europe of what you've been doing,

24:42.120 --> 24:45.160
building here and I've admired the fight against software

24:45.160 --> 24:46.520
patents when you were winning it

24:46.520 --> 24:48.360
and I've been sad at the moments

24:48.360 --> 24:51.520
where it seems like the other side has mustard more power

24:51.520 --> 24:52.360
than you.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.360
Thank you, Derry.

Here's another voice from our large community.

25:45.160 --> 25:46.440
Hi, I'm Bjorn Schiesler.

25:46.440 --> 25:49.760
I came to the FSFE 13 years ago as a volunteer

25:49.760 --> 25:51.440
where I started translating the web page

25:51.440 --> 25:53.680
and stayed as a volunteer since then.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.600
I think FSFE is really important

25:55.600 --> 25:57.960
to have an independent voice in Europe

25:57.960 --> 25:59.440
to talk about free software costs.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.760
It becomes more and more important in a digital society.
