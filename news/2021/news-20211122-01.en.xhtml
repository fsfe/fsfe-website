<h1>Digital Markets Act - the FSFE calls for Device Neutrality</h1>

<p>
  On the imminent voting of the Digital Markets Act - the latest EU proposal on
  internet platform regulation - the FSFE demands device neutrality as a
  fundamental element for safeguarding consumer protection in open, fair and
  contestable digital markets.
</p>

<p>
  While digital devices are a ubiquitous reality in all aspects of people's
  life, control over the hardware and software running on it is increasingly
  being limited by internet platforms, digital services providers, hardware
  manufacturers, and vendors. The European Commission's <a
  href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">Digital
  Markets Act (DMA)</a> is a regulatory instrument for targeting large internet
  companies that act as gatekeepers in digital markets. Such gatekeepers may be
  internet platforms, service providers, manufacturers, and vendors falling into
  criteria defined by law. This regulatory initiative in an attempt to
  create fairer and more competitive markets for online platforms in the EU. On
  November 22, European Parliament's leading IMCO committee will vote on its
  position.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE urges the Members of the European Parliament in the upcoming vote to
  safeguard device neutrality principles based on <a
  href="/freesoftware/standards/">Open Standards</a> and interoperability,
  securing the interest of consumers for a contestable, open, and competitive
  digital market in the EU.

<h2>Free Software and Device Neutrality</h2>

<p>
  <a
  href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html#id-device-neutrality">Device
  neutrality</a> translates as non-discrimination of services and apps by
  providers, manufacturers, and vendors. The objective of device neutrality
  is to enable consumers to bypass gatekeepers and enable a fair and
  non-discriminatory use of Free Software in the application and operating system
  layers of devices. The FSFE claims that the inclusion of the following
  principles must be included in the DMA legislation:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Strict end-user consent for pre-installed apps</b>. DMA must impose to
    gatekeepers the obligation to allow their customers to uninstall any
    pre-installed software applications they provide on their services or with
    their hardware. This means more restrictive rules for pre-installed apps,
    providing users the same access privileges for both pre-installed and
    alternative apps, and the possibility to uninstall pre-loaded apps;
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>No vendor lock-in</b>. The DMA should enable side-loading of apps in
    dominant operating systems, so consumers can install any compatible software
    on their device. DMA shall require gatekeepers to permit third-party app
    stores and code repositories that compete with their own. The law must
    prohibit gatekeepers to limit the ability of end-users to switch between and
    subscribe to different software applications and services. This prevents
    gatekeepers from locking users into specific service providers;
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Interoperability of services based on <a
  href="/freesoftware/standards/">Open Standards</a></b>. It is urgent
    for DMA to require gatekeepers to provide free of charge access to and
    interoperability with the same hardware and software features accessed or
    controlled via an operating system. This includes communication apps and
    social media platforms. Interoperability should be defined by Open
    Standards;
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Real-time data portability</b>. DMA should require gatekeepers to provide
    real-time data portability for devices, so that consumers can switch from
    one device to another - including operating systems - as smoothly as
    possible.
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>
  After the committee voting on Monday, 22 November, the proposal will incorporate the
  approved amendments. Next up is the plenary voting to achieve the
  final position of the European Parliament, planned for December. The FSFE will
  continue to monitor the whole process closely and demand device neutrality at full extent in
  the legislation text, so users are empowered to control technology.

<blockquote>
  "The digital markets will be benefitted by the regulatory proposal of the DMA.
  Device neutrality is fundamental for a fair, competitive, and contestable
  market. We demand stricter consent rules for pre-installed apps, no vendor
  lock-in, full interoperability, and real-time data portability. Free Software
  and Open Standards are key to achieve these goals", says Lucas Lasota, the FSFE's
  Deputy Legal Coordinator.
