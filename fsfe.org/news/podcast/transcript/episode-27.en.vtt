00:07.740 --> 00:12.760
Working for software freedom and producing podcasts costs money.

00:12.760 --> 00:18.200
Please consider supporting us with our nation under fsfe.org/donate and in the

00:18.200 --> 00:19.200

00:30.000 --> 00:36.840
Welcome to the software freedom podcast.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.560
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:40.560 --> 00:47.040
We are a charity that empowers users to take control of technology.

00:47.040 --> 00:51.080
I'm Bonnie Mehring and our guest for this episode is Alexander Sandar.

00:51.080 --> 00:57.480
Alex is the senior policy consultant for the FSFE and in his work for the FSFE, he monitors

00:57.480 --> 01:03.840
the current happenings in the European Union and pushes for the recognition of free software.

01:03.840 --> 01:08.680
Today we will talk about the Open Source hearing in the digital committee of the German

01:08.680 --> 01:10.640
Bundestag.

01:10.640 --> 01:17.520
The hearing took place in the beginning of December on the 4th of December to be precise and

01:17.520 --> 01:22.800
Alex was invited there as an expert for the FSFE foundation Europe.

01:22.800 --> 01:26.600
So what they discussed, we will now talk more about with Alex.

01:26.720 --> 01:32.760
Hi Alex, nice to have you here again for our free software policy update.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.680
Yeah, thanks a lot.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.400
Thanks for the invitation and yeah, happy to be back.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.840
Yeah, thank you for making the time.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.920
It's always nice to hear here.

01:40.920 --> 01:49.640
So you were invited as an expert for the Open Source hearing in the digital

01:49.640 --> 01:51.880
committee of the German Bundestag.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.480
Can you tell me a bit more about this?

01:54.480 --> 01:56.040
Can you tell us the background?

01:56.040 --> 01:57.040
How this happened?

01:57.040 --> 01:59.000
Was there some previous contact?

01:59.000 --> 02:05.200
And also can you tell me who actually organized the meeting and what was on the agenda?

02:05.200 --> 02:06.880
Yeah, absolutely.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.960
A lot of questions.

02:08.960 --> 02:15.960
I'll start with the coalition treaty of the Ampelregierung, which was the government

02:15.960 --> 02:19.000
of Germany in the last years.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.720
And they agreed in their coalition treaty to basically follow the principle of public

02:23.720 --> 02:29.160
money public code, so our initiative where we asked governments, public bodies, public

02:29.160 --> 02:36.160
institutions to release free software whenever they invest in software.

02:36.160 --> 02:41.840
And this demand was more or less put into the coalition treaty and then the government

02:41.840 --> 02:43.840
should have worked on this.

02:43.840 --> 02:51.760
And part of this work is that then also the Bundestag, which is the parliament in Germany,

02:51.760 --> 02:57.320
discusses these topics and comes up with proposals, ideas, and what they want to do in

02:57.320 --> 02:58.320
this.

02:58.320 --> 03:03.120
So, and therefore it's pretty common, then whatever, there is a law-making process or

03:03.120 --> 03:07.920
there's a topic where a government wants to work on or parliament works, wants to work

03:07.920 --> 03:13.720
on that they before they start the work, that they come up with a hearing in order to

03:13.720 --> 03:17.120
get some input from experts.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.720
So, and this is what happened here.

03:18.720 --> 03:25.360
So we gave them input as experts, but unfortunately, as you said, the hearing took place just a

03:25.360 --> 03:32.760
few days ago or in this regard, maybe so already weeks ago, and there is no government anymore.

03:32.760 --> 03:39.720
So here we see that there was already something which was not that normal, not that common

03:39.720 --> 03:42.200
when you normally talk about hearings.

03:42.200 --> 03:48.680
So the thing is, the last government and they didn't really work that much on Open Source.

03:48.680 --> 03:54.480
So they did some things, for example, they followed up with the Center for Digital Democracy,

03:54.480 --> 04:01.160
which is hosting, for example, open code to a code sharing platform for software tools for

04:01.160 --> 04:09.040
the public administrations, but also the standards, so the Center for Digital Soranity creates

04:09.040 --> 04:15.000
the so-called open desk, so office solution for public institutions.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.800
However, not that much happened in between, but the parliamentarians still wanted to have

04:21.800 --> 04:24.640
this hearing since they wanted to debate this.

04:24.640 --> 04:30.320
And here we have to say that the pressure from the committee itself to host this hearing,

04:30.320 --> 04:35.320
no matter if there's a government or not, was the moment that they decided to look we

04:35.320 --> 04:41.040
want to still discuss this, even if we won't act in this term anymore.

04:41.040 --> 04:45.840
So basically the hearing then happened because of a fight of the parliamentarians, and this

04:45.840 --> 04:53.200
is also how the process then works, the parliamentarians who sit in this committee, which is basically,

04:53.200 --> 04:57.960
if you like, a plenary for a specific topic, this is a committee in the parliament, so you

04:57.960 --> 05:02.080
have the plenary in the parliament, and then you have many committees.

05:02.080 --> 05:08.400
One on digital, for example, one on economics, the other one on security, and so on, and

05:08.400 --> 05:09.800
so forth.

05:09.800 --> 05:14.320
And in this digital committee there, they wanted to discuss the topic of Open Source, and then

05:14.320 --> 05:18.800
they agreed on, so even if we didn't have the time to work on this during our term, as

05:18.800 --> 05:24.160
we agreed in the coalition treaty, we still want to run this hearing in order to maybe also

05:24.160 --> 05:29.200
prepare the next government, so that the knowledge, at least, is already out there.

05:29.200 --> 05:35.160
So basically the idea of the hearing is to invite experts to gather ideas, and then out

05:35.160 --> 05:41.160
of this input from the experts, and then also other stakeholders that come externally, law-making

05:41.160 --> 05:42.800
process starts.

05:42.800 --> 05:50.680
So and this happened in the hearing, and they invited basically nine experts from economics,

05:50.680 --> 05:56.360
from civil society, that was our ticket, so to say, from research, but also from public

05:56.360 --> 05:58.640
administrations themselves.

05:58.640 --> 06:05.040
And these nine experts presented their positions towards the hearing, how they think, how

06:05.040 --> 06:09.720
the government, how the next government should work on the topic of Open Source.

06:09.720 --> 06:14.160
This was what happened there in the hearing, and that's why it happened that way and at

06:14.160 --> 06:15.160
this time.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.680
All right.

06:16.680 --> 06:26.200
So even so it now does not really have an effect for the current amperage, which is not,

06:26.200 --> 06:32.960
or which by the time we were released as podcasts, will not be the government of Germany anymore

06:32.960 --> 06:38.680
because it will be after the 16th of December when the German Bundeskanzler will ask the

06:38.680 --> 06:39.680
Vertrauensfrage.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.800
I'm not sure how to say this in English, how do you say it in English?

06:43.800 --> 06:47.960
I think this is a pretty German word, so you can go with this, I guess, so, but it's basically

06:47.960 --> 06:54.560
the attitude to shut down the government, officially, into open and pass away for new elections.

06:54.560 --> 07:02.160
So there is definitely no room for this government to work on this topic, but the members of

07:02.160 --> 07:08.200
the parliament and the institution, the parliament itself, will keep record of this hearing and

07:08.200 --> 07:13.720
the next government will definitely learn about this hearing if they don't learn by themselves.

07:13.720 --> 07:17.640
We will tell them that it happened and that they should listen to what was said because

07:17.640 --> 07:23.520
the hearing itself was very interesting and also from the topics that have been.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.840
Yeah, we will come to this in a second.

07:25.840 --> 07:26.840
Yeah, okay, sure.

07:27.320 --> 07:33.560
Okay, okay, I just want to lay down the foundation so that we are, because not all of our listeners

07:33.560 --> 07:37.920
are from Germany and this is a very German process, I can't imagine.

07:37.920 --> 07:44.680
I guess it is also similar in other countries, but for now, we just lay some of the foundation.

07:44.680 --> 07:50.640
In this committee, there were only coalition members, so there were also other parliamentarians.

07:51.480 --> 07:55.680
No, it's, it's pretty much like, it's, it's organized like a tiny plenary.

07:55.680 --> 08:01.200
So basically in the committee, you have less people than in a plenary, but every group is reflected

08:01.200 --> 08:07.920
in the same amount of people or in the same percentage, like if it would have been a plenary meeting.

08:07.920 --> 08:15.080
So if you have 300 people in a plenary, you have 30 people in the committee and then you just,

08:15.080 --> 08:19.760
like, delete everywhere zero and that's the amount of them members that are then in this

08:19.760 --> 08:21.680
committee to break it down.

08:21.680 --> 08:27.680
So it's something like a small plenary session, but on a very specific topic in this case

08:27.680 --> 08:28.680
digital.

08:28.680 --> 08:34.000
So other members of other parties who are not currently part of the German government

08:34.000 --> 08:40.200
are also in this hearing, they also learn about exactly.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.400
So these are members of the parliament.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.600
So these are, this is not the government, right?

08:44.600 --> 08:51.720
So the parliament is disconnected from the parliament, so you find coalition groups.

08:51.720 --> 08:58.120
So you find the groups that elected basically the government, but they are not the government.

08:58.120 --> 09:04.800
So even if you talk to, in this regard, or in this, in this case, to social democrats,

09:04.800 --> 09:09.800
liberals, or Greens, then you talk to the members of the parliament and not to the members

09:09.800 --> 09:13.200
of the government.

09:13.200 --> 09:18.560
However, the majorities in the parliament are then at these three groups in this example,

09:18.560 --> 09:23.200
and it's likely that they will vote in the direction of the government, but even if the

09:23.200 --> 09:28.800
government proposes a law and brings it to the parliament, members of the parliament

09:28.800 --> 09:30.000
modified this.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.080
So even if a law is proposed by the government, this is normally modified during the parliamentarian

09:36.080 --> 09:40.680
process, but with the majorities of these coalition parties.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.880
So this is the normal workflow.

09:42.880 --> 09:47.640
In this case, so if the government would still have been there, this would have meant that

09:47.640 --> 09:54.320
then based on our input, for us, it would have been important that these coalition parties

09:54.320 --> 09:56.800
follow up based on what we have said.

09:56.800 --> 10:02.120
Because there are none, basically we reached out to one could say everyone who is there.

10:02.120 --> 10:08.440
So basically the next government, so the next parties that formed the government, this

10:08.440 --> 10:13.280
was basically the people we tried to address in this hearing, and this is basically pretty

10:13.280 --> 10:18.280
much more or less everyone that was there in the parliament.

10:18.280 --> 10:19.280
All right.

10:19.280 --> 10:22.560
Thank you very much for the foundation and the background.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.240
And what was actually just Gus in this hearing?

10:25.240 --> 10:29.640
So what was the position that the FSFE brought in and what was the position Althas brought

10:29.640 --> 10:32.320
in there?

10:32.320 --> 10:40.440
So basically every expert had the chance to submit a written statement beforehand.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.360
So before the hearing started, and this is what we did.

10:43.360 --> 10:48.600
So we wrote down, I think it was something like 12 to 15 pages, where we explained our

10:48.600 --> 10:55.760
general views on the topic of Open Source in particular related to governmental actions.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.000
So what the government should do or what the parliament should do in this regard.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.760
So in terms of lawmaking, of implementation, of practical regulation and stuff like this.

11:05.760 --> 11:13.720
And in the hearing itself, we had the chance to present the position in five minute statements.

11:13.720 --> 11:19.120
So we had the chance to say for five minutes, whatever we want to do or whatever we want

11:19.120 --> 11:20.120
to say.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.720
And this was true for every expert.

11:21.720 --> 11:28.200
And then after this first initial round of presenting positions, the members of the committee

11:28.200 --> 11:32.760
had the chance to ask the experts questions that come up for them.

11:32.760 --> 11:40.960
So basically it was this is why it's called hearing a possibility for members to ask experts

11:40.960 --> 11:44.080
on specific things that they want to learn.

11:44.080 --> 11:48.800
So and yeah, obviously we were not aware of potential questions.

11:48.800 --> 11:53.320
So that's why we are experts, we can answer everything.

11:53.320 --> 12:00.240
And so basically this is this is then true for all the nine people that have been invited.

12:00.240 --> 12:06.400
And positions were basically pretty pro Open Source.

12:06.400 --> 12:15.200
So even the representatives of their proprietary vendors agreed on the need for Open Source and

12:15.200 --> 12:22.640
the values of Open Source, however, they also fought for making a point for proprietary

12:22.640 --> 12:23.640
software.

12:23.640 --> 12:28.760
But there was basically only one expert who got in this direction and was a representative

12:28.760 --> 12:33.200
of small and medium enterprises here in Germany.

12:33.200 --> 12:40.880
And but other experts were clearly going in our direction, this basically one could say

12:40.880 --> 12:45.760
following our public money public code demand, asking for investments in Open Source, asking

12:45.760 --> 12:51.400
for migration into Open Source, asking to get rid of the vendor log in and to pass the

12:51.400 --> 12:54.000
way to more digital sovereignty.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.720
And for us, it was important in our position to make clear that digital sovereignty for

12:58.720 --> 13:02.800
example is only possible if you also use free software.

13:02.800 --> 13:07.720
So there won't be digital sovereignty without free software.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.040
So this is a connection we wanted to make.

13:10.040 --> 13:16.040
Also we wanted to underline that only interoperability is possible with free software that contributes

13:16.040 --> 13:21.400
to the goal that administration can work together that they can collaborate.

13:21.400 --> 13:26.280
And by this on the medium and long run can also share costs and expertise.

13:26.280 --> 13:30.600
So the arguments you pretty much know from our public money public code campaign.

13:30.600 --> 13:38.400
And another point we made and there it was basically one could say kind of like a unique

13:38.400 --> 13:43.920
point we brought in or a point that we're not that much discussed by others is the topic

13:43.920 --> 13:50.840
of open washing and this is something we have already seen during the Corona crisis very

13:50.840 --> 13:51.840
prominently.

13:51.840 --> 13:54.600
We also wrote blog posts back in the days on this.

13:54.600 --> 14:01.040
So that there are companies out there pretending to be free software pretending to be Open Source.

14:01.040 --> 14:07.480
But basically they are not so we all know free software Open Source software also has always

14:07.480 --> 14:12.000
have to for freedoms to use study share and improve.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.400
And whenever one of these freedoms or more of these freedoms is cut, then we can't talk

14:17.400 --> 14:19.680
about Open Source of free software.

14:19.680 --> 14:27.200
So we often see this for example that you have for example a limitation in the use case.

14:27.200 --> 14:32.720
So you are only allowed to use this software for 10 persons for example, right?

14:32.720 --> 14:38.080
And this would be a case where we say look this is open washing here is somebody who pretends

14:38.080 --> 14:41.960
to be Open Source, but he's limiting one of the freedoms.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.520
And by thus comparable to green washing.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.000
So this is where we got the term from.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.520
And something similar happens at the moment in the software or in specifically in the open

14:51.520 --> 14:57.240
source world that there are proprietary vendors who see that there's a market that in particular

14:57.240 --> 15:01.960
governments want to have more Open Source and to be still on this market.

15:01.960 --> 15:05.000
They pretend to be Open Source, but they are not.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.040
And this is something we wanted to make yeah, basically parliamentarians, but also in general

15:11.040 --> 15:16.920
the public aware of and that it is important that if you start procurement procedures that

15:16.920 --> 15:22.600
you really get Open Source, when you want Open Source and nothing which only pretends

15:22.600 --> 15:25.000
to be Open Source.

15:25.000 --> 15:32.080
How are the reactions to the discussion about open washing because like this is a very

15:32.080 --> 15:33.600
new discussion.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.800
So it's not something that a lot of people are already aware of.

15:37.800 --> 15:44.360
And it's something that's also a bit complicated because it's not always quite simple to see

15:44.360 --> 15:49.280
if a product is actually really Open Source or free software.

15:49.280 --> 15:53.920
So how are the reactions to this from the parliamentarians?

15:53.920 --> 15:56.200
I mean, you are right.

15:56.200 --> 16:04.040
So this is a pretty new topic and so the reaction I would say was not that they specifically

16:04.040 --> 16:10.040
picked up the determine only discuss this, but it was clear that they understood the point

16:10.040 --> 16:18.040
that was for example, yeah, a conversation about how do we release the code towards whom

16:18.040 --> 16:22.600
and who should have access to the code because this is definitely something which we also

16:22.600 --> 16:29.080
see from the German government so that they hide their project, that they hide their code.

16:29.080 --> 16:35.840
And there is definitely a question if this is because of a license or if this is because

16:35.840 --> 16:40.320
of a non Open Source license that they hide their code.

16:40.320 --> 16:45.680
And here we made a point that we need to investigate and also that we need to make sure

16:45.680 --> 16:48.040
that the code is released.

16:48.040 --> 16:55.440
And we have also seen in the past in particular around the German procurement procedures that

16:55.440 --> 17:01.640
there are already open versions around this is what we addressed and yeah, it was picked

17:01.640 --> 17:07.440
up by another question, but it's also not the case in such hearings that you have a lot

17:07.440 --> 17:13.440
of time to explain or to discuss in details because for the questions back and forth

17:13.440 --> 17:17.280
themselves, you have another line one or two minutes.

17:17.280 --> 17:24.400
So basically you can just put out statements again, but it was clear that the topic was

17:24.400 --> 17:32.200
basically understood and it was also seen in the media afterwards that this was picked

17:32.200 --> 17:35.960
up and that people understood that there might be an issue and that we need to address

17:35.960 --> 17:40.240
this issue and that's I'd say a success for such a hearing.

17:40.240 --> 17:45.960
So but it's very uncommon that you start a really like a in-depth debate then on this

17:45.960 --> 17:51.240
very specific topic also hidden in mind that there have been eight other experts next

17:51.240 --> 17:59.520
to me also with other topics and what I liked a lot is that I had the feeling that parliamentarians

17:59.520 --> 18:05.560
really understood the values of Open Source that they understood the core idea of Open Source

18:05.560 --> 18:12.080
or they understood the four freedoms and they understood that the four freedoms are important

18:12.080 --> 18:21.360
also on the question of how does it benefit not only the procurement process itself, but

18:21.360 --> 18:29.680
also we talked about spillover effects just to mention, for example, the education sector.

18:29.680 --> 18:34.760
So that was something we also discussed so that's also very important to have free software

18:34.760 --> 18:40.840
in education so that you are not educated to have a PowerPoint but that you are educated

18:40.840 --> 18:47.400
to run a presentation so that you are not teach the product but rather on how to control

18:47.400 --> 18:54.200
technology and these were more practical discussion points we had on the radar.

18:54.200 --> 18:59.800
But for all of this, open washing definitely plays a role and there was one side question

18:59.800 --> 19:07.800
on this and a couple of remarks in this regard so we can see that this topic is at least

19:07.800 --> 19:12.920
on the radar of these people and that's already success.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.400
So it's picked up.

19:15.400 --> 19:25.960
So you already mentioned that you are all feeling or the overall atmosphere was that they are

19:25.960 --> 19:32.760
pro Open Source and free software or that the parliamentarians who attended this were very

19:32.760 --> 19:37.640
much in favor. Do you have the feeling that this actually changed over the years because you are

19:38.440 --> 19:46.040
in the policy game for quite a long time now? I'm not talking about age again but just

19:46.040 --> 19:55.240
your experience there. Do you have the feeling that it's actually that the understanding of free

19:55.240 --> 20:01.000
software and the understanding of the four freedoms increased over the past years?

20:01.480 --> 20:09.880
Definitely. So there is definitely so we can see a lot of progress and I mean this debate

20:10.440 --> 20:15.880
like it has happened there 10 years ago would have been impossible even five years ago.

20:15.880 --> 20:21.320
It would have not been this in that conversation with members of the parliament and that would

20:21.320 --> 20:28.360
have been way more missed out there than we hear today. So and also you can see it in the law

20:28.440 --> 20:35.560
making process or in the regulation process itself. So you can see more and more documents

20:35.560 --> 20:41.720
that value the use of Open Source that we want to go more in this direction that we want to have

20:41.720 --> 20:48.360
more and more and more. The only thing that we see is that we are basically at the point that

20:48.360 --> 20:53.400
we have enough papers one could say it's start to implement this it's start to act on this

20:53.400 --> 20:59.240
and this is I think where we lack and this is where we need to create some pressure so that we

20:59.240 --> 21:05.160
not only talk about the advantages but that we also do something in this regard and this means

21:06.600 --> 21:12.200
that we not just create these papers but that we also give for example resources

21:13.240 --> 21:18.040
to these projects and that's also something where I said we need to

21:18.680 --> 21:24.520
rethink our current approach I mean with our public money public court campaign we talk about

21:24.520 --> 21:30.280
procurement and I think procurement is the most important part when it comes to to Open Source

21:30.280 --> 21:36.920
in public administration. So that's the easiest and most efficient way to get and to support

21:36.920 --> 21:43.160
free and Open Source software but there's also other things I mean there's a market out there and

21:43.240 --> 21:49.160
I do believe that these people on the market in particular those who only benefit from free software

21:49.160 --> 21:56.440
should also contribute back to the free software ecosystem and here I do believe that we also need

21:56.440 --> 22:03.480
rules and this is something we're also asked the parliamentarians to work on so to come up as

22:03.480 --> 22:09.400
funding for free software not only from the government but also from the market themselves

22:10.120 --> 22:16.440
and here this is something where we need to work on and where we need to create pressure

22:16.440 --> 22:21.880
that there's implementation last time we met we discussed how the European Commission

22:21.880 --> 22:28.120
removed funds needed funds for core infrastructure projects for free software this is the wrong

22:28.120 --> 22:33.160
direction you cannot say on the one hand we want to invest in Open Source and we want to go in

22:33.160 --> 22:38.680
this direction and then we move these funds on the other hand this is the wrong way and this is

22:38.680 --> 22:44.360
also something where we need to have an eye on it's not only about good words it's also about

22:44.360 --> 22:50.680
resources it's about acting it's about doing at a long term perspective especially

22:51.800 --> 22:57.560
absolutely I mean we made it that they understood our point now we need to make them doing

22:59.640 --> 23:04.680
we have to feeling that something is happening in this direction as well because I would absolutely

23:04.680 --> 23:10.760
agree there's a lot of paper on Open Source or free software in public procurement and there's a

23:10.760 --> 23:21.000
lot of talk about using free software in the public administration but so far very little is happening

23:23.560 --> 23:29.880
can you like tell me a bit more about your idea or your feeling in this direction and if there's

23:30.600 --> 23:38.120
if there will be more happening in the next period what's your feeling I know it's a guest question

23:38.120 --> 23:45.640
I know we can't say for sure but yeah and particularly in this time since we even do not know

23:45.640 --> 23:53.320
election results it's pretty difficult it depends and this is very clear on the way of the parties

23:53.320 --> 23:59.400
and that will form the next government yeah and here we will again try that we get our sayings in

23:59.400 --> 24:07.160
the coalition treaty and a very concrete point we will have is that we for example have this

24:07.160 --> 24:12.760
agenda for digital sovereignty which I just mentioned earlier that have these tools that they

24:12.760 --> 24:20.600
already work on and that they want to have a yeah office solution which is free software for

24:20.600 --> 24:27.640
the German and maybe even European administrations out there but this needs funding so this needs

24:27.640 --> 24:34.040
resources and here we will definitely ask for resources and make sure that these resources also

24:34.040 --> 24:41.160
only go into free software that's a that's a very concrete and practical thing to do and this is

24:41.160 --> 24:49.560
something which I do believe will be followed up by the next government in some way the question is

24:49.560 --> 24:55.080
how much resources do they give them and how much do they value what they do so there will be

24:55.080 --> 25:02.200
there will be some follow-up so to say and this tenders won't die with the next government

25:02.200 --> 25:09.480
but the question is will it be a real center for digital sovereignty or will it only be

25:10.440 --> 25:18.040
something that has the name to be a center all right so we need to see what's happening in the next

25:18.040 --> 25:22.520
few months yeah we have to fight for this and this is what we will do so basically at the moment

25:22.520 --> 25:29.960
we are already reaching out also based on this hearing and trying to identify those who most

25:29.960 --> 25:37.000
likely will negotiate the next coalition treaties and try to present them our positions make them

25:37.000 --> 25:42.920
aware that we can be asked as experts so if they want to write text or if they want to come up with

25:42.920 --> 25:50.200
new ideas or rules that they can reach out to us and that we help them yeah to find a good

25:50.200 --> 25:55.720
position on this and by thus influence the coalition treaty but then also based on this

25:56.760 --> 26:02.920
what happened in the past and what is needed for the future so that we face them basically

26:02.920 --> 26:08.680
with the real world problems that are out there when it comes to the use of software and then

26:08.680 --> 26:12.920
it's clear we have to go in the direction of resoftware and we continue this path and as you said

26:12.920 --> 26:18.360
it's a long term game so nothing is one nothing is lost but we continue

26:20.600 --> 26:26.840
right so we should definitely keep an eye on this and I think we will talk about this more in the

26:26.840 --> 26:36.120
future yeah maybe one quick remark on this so there's also recording of the whole hearing on our

26:36.120 --> 26:42.600
media.fsc.e.org channel but there's also a version which is only cut to the statements which

26:42.600 --> 26:49.800
I presented for the FSC which is 12 minutes so if you are happened to be a German speaker or

26:49.800 --> 26:56.360
if you know somebody who can translate this to you for free to watch this to get an impression

26:56.360 --> 27:05.880
of the whole hearing but also our takes and can also find the written statement this is also

27:05.880 --> 27:14.440
public yeah if in the moment it's only available in German but we think about translating it into

27:14.440 --> 27:22.520
English since this is yeah also true for pretty much every government and I want to distribute it

27:22.520 --> 27:30.600
over there so we will also use this hearing in order to reach out to other countries other governments

27:30.600 --> 27:38.360
and telling them about our expert position and so the name of the Bundestag definitely gives this

27:38.360 --> 27:44.120
gives the topic some sort of relevance and by thus we can go to others tell them about

27:44.760 --> 27:51.080
this hearing in a best practice story and create momentum maybe even in other countries so it's

27:51.080 --> 27:59.480
not limited on German what we are doing Mr. Singh but we try to create yeah or use this resource

27:59.480 --> 28:05.400
also for other countries so that we can have impact not only in Germany but European right all right

28:07.720 --> 28:13.480
out of the resources are also linked in the show notes and now we have talked quite a lot about

28:14.200 --> 28:19.640
what we need to do in the future what's happening right now what's happened what happened in

28:19.640 --> 28:26.360
this hearing and how this hearing helped us I would like to come to my final question and ask you

28:26.360 --> 28:33.400
what was the most positive thing that you saw about the invite and the hearing itself so

28:34.200 --> 28:40.200
what was that that stood out for you I think there was a moment in the hearing when

28:41.160 --> 28:49.400
the representative of this SME group who is pretty much a favor of proper derives of there

28:49.480 --> 28:54.120
when he got the question by basically a liberal member of the parliament and

28:55.480 --> 29:02.040
basically when he tried to explain why his solutions are also digital serenity

29:02.760 --> 29:10.360
digital serenity got stopped by the MP the liberal MP who asked the question and he just said look

29:10.360 --> 29:16.760
I'm also coming from the SME world and in particular SMEs are pretty innovative and the market

29:16.760 --> 29:22.920
changed and you should go with the market and the market is now Open Source so and this is I think

29:23.480 --> 29:31.880
something which shows how the market also changed and how also liberals already look at this market

29:31.880 --> 29:39.960
and see that yeah it's a market for Open Source and that you as a company should rather adapt

29:39.960 --> 29:44.840
if you want to be around in the software market in the future and I think that's something

29:45.400 --> 29:51.240
that many companies should think of when a liberal MP tells them that the market changed

29:53.480 --> 29:58.200
yeah that's quite outstanding I'm really happy now that I asked this question

30:00.120 --> 30:09.000
you know you know what I found so fascinating about this is that the FSFE has been doing

30:09.080 --> 30:16.760
and is still doing incredible work for free software and you would have imagined 10 years ago

30:17.320 --> 30:24.440
that you would sit in a committee like this and be invited as an expert I think this is amazing how

30:24.440 --> 30:30.920
far we have gotten and this is only possible because of the support we receive from all the people

30:30.920 --> 30:38.840
that are out there and that are donating to the FSFE that are being volunteers of ours

30:38.840 --> 30:45.400
this is also something really incredible how far we have gotten over the past years

30:46.600 --> 30:52.600
yeah and in particular I mean it could have happened that we have been invited to a hearing

30:52.600 --> 30:57.240
but it would have only been us with this position and now we have a hearing that the

30:57.240 --> 31:02.440
proprietary person is the only one with this position and all the others are Open Source and I

31:02.440 --> 31:07.480
think that's the thing that changed and that they listen to us they might have even invited us

31:07.480 --> 31:13.640
in the past but we would have been the one person and this changed into eight persons

31:14.280 --> 31:21.320
and the one not talking about Open Source is singled out and even told by the MP that he might have

31:21.320 --> 31:29.240
to sing about his position absolutely and he's right so I have to say this liberal MP was right

31:29.640 --> 31:41.880
all right thank you very much Alex for sharing all the background the story and for giving us
