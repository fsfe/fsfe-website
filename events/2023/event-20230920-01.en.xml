      <p>This is a group for women who are interested in Free Software. We get together online once a month to chat, give talks about topics we care about and discuss recent developments.<br />
The group is women-centric and open to all women, inter, trans and non-binary people.</p>
      <p>We'll have a talk by Bernhard E. Reiter about email, GPG, S/MIME and related topics.</p>
