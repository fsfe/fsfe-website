	signatures</li>
	<li>Send follow up letters to institutions that have been contacted in the past

<h2>Note on scripts</h2>

<p>A PHP script is available in the web SVN which generates .odt files directly from the XML
bug reports which are generated by the web form on the PDF Readers campaign page. See readme
file located with the script for additional instructions. This script is designed to be easy
to set up and use (send feedback to web@lists.fsfe.org mailing list).</p>
