<h1>Brave GNU World</h1>
</center>

<p>Started in January 1999, the Brave GNU World is a monthly column
which has since then been released in nine languages[<a
href="#languages">*</a>] on the web and printed in the German
"Linux-Magazin," the "Linux Magazine" U.K., "Microsoftware" (a large
computer magazine in Korea) and the "Linux-Magazine" in France. That
might just make it the monthly column with the widest distribution
wordwide.</p>

<p>The column is written by Georg Greve, President of the FSF Europe,
also for people with limited technical background or limited knowledge
about Free Software and the GNU Project backgrounds and tries to give
insights into different projects or developments from the GNU point of
view.</p>

<p>The home page of Georg's Brave GNU World can be found at
