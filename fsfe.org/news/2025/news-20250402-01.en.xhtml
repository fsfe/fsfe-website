<p>As part of the “<a
href="https://www.dialog-cybersicherheit.de/workstreams/">Dialog für
Cybersicherheit</a>” (Dialogue on Cybersecurity) project, the FSFE and
the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) are working together
with representatives from civil society, academia, industry and public
authorities in a project on the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and its
implication for Free Software. To ensure clarity, information is needed
on who will take on which role and which tasks and processes are to be
carried out. In particular, <a
href="http://news/2024/news-20240312-01.html">the role of Open Source
Stewards and Free Software beyond commercial interest</a> are of
particular importance to the project. </p>


<p>As part of the project, experts are invited to give talks and share
their expertise to shed light on those questions. On Thursday a
presentation by Maarten Aertsen (NLnet Labs) will take place, focusing
on how Free Source Software is addressed by the Cyber Resilience Act and
in particular on how that is different from other New Legislative
Framework (NLF) style regulations in different segments. Afterwards
there will be time for a discussion.</p>
