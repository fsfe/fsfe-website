        Device Neutrality is the policy concept to regulate monopoly over
        devices and re-establish end-user control over their digital equipment.
        The Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulates the economic activity of large
        digital platforms and introduces Device Neutrality into EU
        legislation, fostering access to Free Software in devices.

    <h2 id="dma-monopolisation-end-user-rights">Market monopolisation and end-users' rights</h2>

    <p>
      The monopolistic power of large tech corporations causes distortions in
      digital markets. This negatively affects end-users’ rights and control over
      devices. Users' freedoms relating to Free Software depend on a political
      and economic environment in which they can exercise their free choice
      when using their devices without being stuck in closed environments under
      control of gatekeepers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="/activities/deviceneutrality/#device-neutrality-free-software">Device Neutrality</a> is
      a policy concept aimed to deal with unbalanced power over digital devices.
      Free Software has a central role to re-establish fair competition
      and market dynamics that are more favourable to end-users. In this page we
      will learn how digital markets can benefit from strict rules for
      regulating the economic activity of companies with such power. The Digital Markets
      Act (DMA) is an example of such regulation. With proper enforcement, the law has
      the potential to facilitate access to Free Software in devices.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      Device Neutrality translates in the  DMA as stricter consent rules for
      pre-installed apps, safeguards against vendor lock-in, and data interoperability.
      Such regulatory elements represent powerful mechanisms to safeguard better
      access and usage of Free Sofware in devices by end-users. Nevertheless, the enforcement
      of these rules holds challenges for the practical implementation of Device Neutrality principles, and
      ultimate attainment of Device Neutrality.

   <h2 id="dma-overview">Digital Markets Act: an overview</h2>

    <p>
      The <a
      href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/1925">Digital
      Markets Act (DMA)</a> - Regulation (EU) 2022/1925 - regulates the
      economic activity of large digital platforms that act as "gatekeepers" in
      an attempt to create a fairer and more competitive market for online
      platforms in the EU. The DMA is an important advance, setting up
      several anti-monopoly obligations that impact software freedom,
      interoperability, and control over personal data. The three principal
      elements of the DMA are the designation of gatekeepers, the list of
      dos and don'ts, and the enforcement mechanisms.
    </p>



   <h3 id="dma-gatekeepers">Who are the gatekeepers</h3>

    <p>
      The scope of the DMA does not cover all digital services in the markets,
      but only those qualifying as "core platform services" (CPSs) listed in
      Art. 2(2). These include online intermediation services, search engines,
      social networks, video sharing platforms, messaging apps, operating
      systems, web browsers, virtual assistants, cloud computing services, and
      online advertising.
    </p>

      <figcaption>
        Gatekeepers can be device manufacturers, vendors or internet platforms
        that meet the criteria defined by the DMA.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The DMA constitutes asymmetric regulation. Its obligations do not apply to
      all tech companies, but only to those providers which have been designated
      as <i>gatekeepers</i>. Such designation is done by the European
      Commission based on a cumulative "three criteria test" listed in Art.3(1):
      Gatekeepers are those companies with "significant impact on the EU
      internal market", which "control an important gateway for business users
      to reach end-users", and enjoy an "entrenched and durable position in the
      market". The DMA presumes the criteria are met when the company is extremely
      large with an average market capitalisation of ≥ EUR 75 billion and more than
      45 million monthly active end-users.
    </p>

   <h3 id="dma-device-neutrality-rules">Device Neutrality rules in the DMA</h3>

    <p>
      DMA is an economic regulatory tool, not consumer protection legislation.
      But many of its rules directly and indirectly affect end-users. The DMA
      seeks to balance the power of gatekeepers in digital markets by protecting
      end-users from monopolistic practices and promoting fair competition
      among market players. For Device Neutrality, this means that
      end-users should be able to bypass gatekeepers and have the right to access
      alternative routes to the markets, so they can enjoy products and services
      not dominated by gatekeepers (e.g. installing Free Software on their devices).
      In other words, gatekeepers should not restrict business and individual end-users from
      accessing rival routes to market for content, software, and other
      digital services.
     </p>

        End-users should be able to bypass gatekeepers in order to access rival content,
        software and other digital services on the markets.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>
      The DMA presents a list of "hard" and "soft" obligations for each of
      the gatekeeper’s core platform services that are designated by the
      Commission in Arts. 5-7, coupled with corrective mechanisms
      in Arts. 8-13. These include <a
      href="https://download.fsfe.org/device-neutrality/art-dma-dn.pdf">
      several provisions related to Device Neutrality</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In relation to <strong>software freedom</strong>, gatekeepers
      are required to allow end-users to uninstall any pre-installed
      software in devices (Art. 6(3)), as well as to enable the installation
      and use of third-party apps or apps stores on devices (Art. 6 (4)).
    </p>

     <p>
      The DMA includes several provisions to enhance the <strong>protection
      against vendor lock-in</strong>. Gatekeepers cannot prohibit app developers
      to set different prices and conditions for their apps in alternative stores
      (e.g. F-Droid) (Art. 5(3)). Gatekeepers cannot make software developers
      and end-users register or sign in for a service or app as a condition for access to
      their or another gatekeeper's service or app (Art. 5(7)). Besides,
      they should allow end-users to access and use third-party apps, content,
      subscriptions, features, or other functionalities (Art. 5(5)). Finally,
      Gatekeepers cannot restrict the ability of end-users to switch between and
      subscribe to different apps and services that are accessed via the operating system
      or apps store (Art. 6(6)).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Interoperability and control over data</strong> is also contemplated
      as an important factor against lock-in. Gatekeepers should provide the same
      hardware and software features accessed or controlled via the operating system
      to third-party developers (Art. 6(7). This includes data interoperability
      (also called real-time data portability (Art. 6(9) and
      interoperability among messaging apps (Art. 7).
    </p>

    <h3 id="dma-enforcement-mechanisms">Enforcement mechanisms</h3>

    <p>
      The DMA represents a new attitude towards platform regulation. It is a
      hybrid form of competition and telecommunications law, whereby a
      designated authority identifies who will fall under the scope of
      the regulation. However, unlike telecom law, which requires action by national
      regulatory authorities, enforcement is centralized in the European
      Commission. The Commission can investigate (Art. 16) whether a company
      should be designated as a gatekeeper and its compliance, as well as update
      the list of obligations. The Commission can also impose fines up to 10% of
      the gatekeeper's yearly turnover or periodic penalty payments up to 5% of
      the average daily worldwide turnover (Arts. 30-31).
    </p>

    <p>
      End-users, competitors and other organisations can collaborate in the enforcement
      of the DMA by informing national regulatory authorities about illegal practices
      by gatekeepers. The regulators can communicate to the Commission to start proceedings.

   <h2 id="dma-concerns-fs">DMA's implementation and Free Software</h2>

    <p>
      Users' freedoms relating to Free Software depend on a political
      and economic environment in which they can exercise their free choice
      when using their devices without being stuck in closed environments under
      control of gatekeepers. Digital markets can benefit with the DMA regulating
      the commercial practices of large platforms, forcing them to facilitate
      access to Free Software in devices. Nevertheless, the DMA still falls short
      in some aspects involving Open Standards, the pressure gatekeepers can exercise
      over decision makers, and complex digital enviroments.
    </p>

    <figure class="no-border">

        alt="Illustration of smartphoe, tablet and interface." />
      <figcaption>
        Although DMA represents a step forward in terms of gatekeeper regulation,
        there are be challenges for effective implementation.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

  <h3 id="dma-open-standards-missing">Open Standards are missing</h3>

    <p>
      In the legislative process, the FSFE urged the inclusion of clear
      language mandating the adoption of Open Standards for the interoperability
      obligations, which was not done in the final version of the law.
      Instead, the DMA mentions "free and effective interoperability"
      (Art. 6(7)) regarding hardware and software features that can be
      accessed/controlled via an operating system by third parties, as well as
      "fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access conditions" to apps
      stores, search engines, and operating systems. The solution adopted may
      allow gatekeepers to implement proprietary standards and restrictive
      access to APIs that are incompatible with Free Software. This was a lost
      chance to leverage competition with accessible and non-discriminatory
      technical specifications. Open Standards remain an important element for
      innovation by allowing market actors to innovate on top of technical
      standards.
    </p>

  <h3 id="dma-security-vs-commercial">Security concerns vs commercial interests</h3>

    <p>
      Another source of concern relates to how the law allows gatekeepers to
      limit interoperability for the sake of integrity and security of the
      gatekeepers' services or devices (Art. 6 (3) and (7)). Our experience
      demonstrates that companies have been claiming security concerns to limit
      users' rights and software freedom even in the absence of empirical
      evidence of such risks for the integrity of the devices. Instead,
      commercial interests are the main drive to pursue such restrictive
      practices. This provision in the DMA has the potential to hinder
      compliance or even, in a worse case, strength or consolidate the
      gatekeepers' entrenched position in the market.
    </p>

   <h3 id="dma-complex-enforcement">Complex enforcement</h3>

    <p>
      The procedural enforcement efforts also raise questions regarding
      achieving real and effective Device Neutrality. The DMA encompasses the
      regulation of several complex layers of devices, as operating systems,
      browsers, and apps stores, as well as interoperability and data portability.
      Similarly to telecommunications law, such measures would require further
      specification and further regulatory efforts for practical
      implementation. As our experience has shown with Router Freedom in the EU,
      although the related telecom rules were much simpler to implement, even so
      they have been taking years to be properly applied by national regulators.
      Therefore, not only the lobbying power of such platforms, the
      allowances the law makes towards "security and integrity", and the absence of
      clear language mandating Open Standards, but also market pressure can
      relativize the enforcement priorities of the Commission and other
      policymaking bodies.
