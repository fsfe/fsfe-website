    <h1>Hundreds of love declarations in about 24 hours</h1>

    <p newsteaser="yes">
February 14, 01:38:27 UTC, the first identi.ca message related to FSFE’s “<a href="/campaigns/valentine/2011/valentine-2011.html">I ♥ Free Software</a>” campaign airs on identi.ca. This was only the start of a tremendous love declaration to Free Software developpers and applications that went out until late at night, around 3:00 a.m.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Valentine's Day 2011, FSFE <a href="/news/2011/news-20110214-01.html">had called</a> Free Software users to show that they appreciate Free Software, sending love messages to developers, to communities or to simply put them online on their blogs. The FSFE website had itself turned pink and red to show its love for Free Software.
    </p>

   <p>On the day after the campaign, we invite you to <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/maelle/?p=228">read the summary of the highlights of the day</a>. You can also have a look at all the messages people have posted on identi.ca: <a href="http://identi.ca/ilovefs">http://identi.ca/ilovefs</a>.
</p>

    <p>
Thank you all for your participation! It's been a pleasure to see so much activity on this Valentine's day 2011, and of course there will be even more next year! :-)
