  Huawei case demonstrates importance of Free Software for security
</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">The discussion of the Huawei security concerns 
showcases a general trust issue when it comes to critical 
infrastructure. A first step to solve this problem is to publish the 
code under a Free and Open Source Software licence and take measures to 
facilitate its independently-verifiable distribution.</p>

<p>The ongoing debate about banning Huawei hardware for the rollout of 
5G networks, following earlier state espionage allegations, falls too 
short. It is not just about the Chinese company but about a general 
lack of transparency within this sector. As past incidents proved, the 
problem of backdoors inside blackboxed hard- and software is widely 
spread, independently from the manufacturers' origins.</p>

<p>However, it is unprecedented that the demand to inspect the source 
code of a manufacturer's equipment has been discussed so broadly and 
intensely. The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) welcomes that the 
importance of source code is recognised, but is afraid that the 
proposed solution falls too short. Allowing inspection of the secret 
code by selected authorities and telephone companies might help in this 
specific case, but will not solve the general problem.</p>

<p>To establish trust in critical infrastructure like 5G, it is a 
crucial precondition that all software code powering those devices is 
published under a Free and Open Source Software licence. Free and Open 
Source Software guarantees the four freedoms to use, study, share, and 
improve an application. On this basis, everyone can inspect the code, 
not only for backdoors, but for all security risks. Only these freedoms 
allow for independent and continuous security audits which will lead 
citizens, the economy, and the public sector to trust their 
communication and data exchange.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in order to verify code integrity – so that the 
provided source code corresponds to the executable code running on the 
equipment – it is either necessary that there are reproducible builds 
in case of binary distribution, or that providers are brought into the 
position to compile and deploy the code on their own.</p>

<blockquote><p>"We should not only debate the Huawei case but extend 
the discussion to all critical infrastructure." says Max Mehl, FSFE 
Programme Manager. "Only with Free and Open Source Software, 
transparency and accountability can be guaranteed. This is a long-known 
crucial precondition for security and trust. We expect from state 
actors to immediately implement this solution not only for the Huawei 
case but for all comparable IT security issues."</p></blockquote>
