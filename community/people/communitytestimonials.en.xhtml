    <h1 id="id-interviews">"We are the FSFE": Our community</h1>

    <div id="introduction">
		<p>FSFE is a charity dedicated to empowering users to control technology. Together with our community we form a movement to build freedom in digital society. There will never be enough space to shed light on all the creative minds and motivated people who helped us grow and share our mission. Still, we like to highlight at least some of our priceless community members who in one way or another shaped the FSFE's profile to become what we are now. </p>

		<p>On this page you find diverse people from the FSFE community, who are willing to let the world know what Free Software means to them. All of them left a testimonial, some answered an interview or even made a video. Enjoy getting to know our community!</p>
