<h2>How to ask your candidates</h2>

<h3>What questions to ask</h3>

<p>Before you start asking questions you should think about what you want to
ask. We encourage you to dive into our <a href="/projects/work.html">different
  areas of activies</a>, <a href="/news/news.html">our news items</a>, and take
a look at <strong><a
    href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/AskYourCandidates">already asked
    questions</a></strong> as an inspiration for your own questions.</p>

<h3>How to contact political candidates</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Identify candidates working in an area where an election is taking place, and ideally who have knowledge or experience relating to Free Software and/or Open Standards. Such a person is more likely understand and respond to your question.</li>
	<li>Send the candidate your questions by email, post, or both.</li>
	<li>Publish your message (eg. on blogs.fsfe.org) in order to increase the incentive for the candidate to reply. </li>
	<li><a href="/contact/contact.html">Let us know</a> that you've sent it so that we can raise awareness of your actions and help to follow them up.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to contact political parties</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Create a survey, optionally using <a href="/projects/askyourcandidates/survey.html">our examples[FIXME]</a>, and send a printed copy to the party's postal address..</li>
	<li>For each response that you receive read through the answers to your questions and summarise them on the dedicated survey answers <a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/AskYourCandidates/ELECTIONNAME-DATE">wiki page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Increasing the impact of your actions</h3>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/contact/contact.html">Inform us</a> of your plan to contribute to the campaign so that we can notify you of previous attempts and provide assistance.</li>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/AskYourCandidates/ELECTIONNAME-DATE">Create a wiki page</a> with the questions that you asked and the answers that you received (examples: <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Bundestagswahl2009">German parliamentary elections 2009</a>, <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/groups/vienna/Wahl2010">Vienese communal election 2010</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://planet.fsfe.org">Blog</a> and microblog regularly about your activities in order to give others the opportunity to follow what you're doing. Some ideas for what to blog about include what prompted you to begin contacting candidates in the first place, your experiences composing and sending the questions or survey, any interesting enquiries you receive as a result of sending them, and what responses you expect to recieve.</li>

  <!-- Why not keep it in the wiki? We would have to translate all the quesitons and answers if we move it to the static pages... -->
 	<li>Once you've gathered responses from enough candidates or parties we will create a page on fsfe.org summarising them, possibly with a coinciding press release (example: <a href="/projects/btw09/btw09.html">German Federal election 2009</a>). 
 	
 	<!-- we can't expect them to do this themselves - hardly anyone has web svn access outside the web team so they won't even be able to copy an existing page and edit it. We can't expect people to learn our build system simply in order to contact a candidate
 	Save the page under /projects/askyourcandidates/NAME_OF_ELECTION-YEAR. <a href="mailto:fellowship@fsfeurope.org">Submit it to FSFE</a> for publishing.-->
 	</li>
  
</ul>
