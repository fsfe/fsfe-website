<h1 class="n">I ♥  Free Software</h1>

<p id="introduction"> Valentines Day is a celebration of love and affection
between intimate companions. You've never declared your love and gratitude to
the people behind every <a href="/about/basics/freesoftware.html">Free
  Software</a> initiative and organisation? Why not make this February 14th a
very special day and show them that you appreciate their work?</p>

<h2>Some instant love declarations</h2>

<p> Behind every Free Software initiative and organisation are real,
hard-working people. Show them that you appreciate their work – it could make
all the difference! Some Free Software advocates have already shared statements
with us <a
  href="/campaigns/valentine/2011/testimonials">why they love Free
  Software</a>. Follow their example!</p>

<!-- picture of jonas + link to http://www.ffkp.se/ Society for Free Culture and Software (Föreningen fri kultur och programvara) -->

<blockquote><p>"On Valentines Day, the Society for Free Culture and Software, extends their
love to projects such as Audacity, GIMP, Inkscape and other audiovisual tools.
These tools form the backbone of the infrastructure needed to support free
culture and while free culture could technically exist independently of Free
Software, the two movements share a common philosophy of freedom which make the
two inseparable.  Without Free Software, our activities would be so much more
difficult to carry out, and no free culture project would be able to enjoy the
full freedoms without the infrastructure created by Free Software projects such
as those outlined before. To everyone engaged in supporting this
infrastructure: thank you! We love you!"</p></blockquote>


<h2>Time to go public</h2>
