<p>With every day, computers become a bigger part of our lives. Our phone
is a computer that we carry in our pocket. Cars, as Cory Doctorow
says, are just computers that we sit inside. Computers in
every shape and form have become central building blocks of our
civilisation.
Who controls these computers? If they are
black boxes that keep their internal workings secret from us, if their
makers have artificially restricted them to limit what we can do with
them, then although we may pay for these computers -- we can never own
them.  </p></div>

<p>In order to be in charge of our own lives, we need to be able to
control the computers we use. We can only do this if they run Free
Software that we can use, study, share and improve. We can only do
this if our computers aren't neutered to restrict their functionality,
or loaded with spyware. We also need neutral networks to connect them
to, so we can freely choose what to say, and to whom.</p>

<p>With this in mind, 2012 was both a good and a bad year for our
freedom. Android is an example of how ambiguous things
can get. More than 500 million smartphones and tablets with the Free
Software operating system have been sold so far, putting Free Software
in the hands of more people than ever before. But this is also an
operating system that sometimes limits what users can do with their phones; 
manufacturers add non-removable proprietary software, lock the bootloader, and companies 
try to bind you to their services that makes it hard for users to find out whether the apps 
they install are Free Software;  and that hoovers up lots of private data. This is why we 
launched the <a href=" https://fsfe.org/campaigns/android/android.en.html">Free Your
Android campaign</a> to help
empower citizens to take full control of their mobile devices.</p>

<p>These new challenges are the latest in a series of long-standing problems that we have
been working on for years. Governments and the public sector should be
a natural customer base for Free Software companies and
developers. Yet, public bodies across Europe remain stuck in the
stranglehold of proprietary software vendors. We have continued
to work on fixing government procurement and wider Free Software
policies, whether in Brussels, London, Berlin or Helsinki. 
We are proud to give the Free Software movement a voice in politics,
and policy makers increasingly turn to FSFE for expertise and
input. We helped the UK government shape its new 
<a href=" https://fsfe.org/activities/os/os.en.html">Open Standards</a> policy, 
and advised the German parliament on Free Software issues.</p>
<p>We worked hard to get the Free Software message out. During 2012, FSFE
staff and volunteers gave more than 50 talks at events across
Europe. At many of these events, we also set up a booth where people
could easily find us to talk about Free Software, ask for help, and
learn about our work. Besides, FSFE Fellows organised more than [FIXME:
waiting for Ana's input] events across [FIXME] countries. The lawyers
and engineers in the Legal Network that we facilitate brought the
latest in Free Software thinking to their companies and clients.
Thanks to all this work, and that of the many groups and individuals with 
whom we join forces, the world is slowly changing. Every day, more people
wake up to the power of coopeation and sharing. Every day, more people 
expect freedom by default.</p>
<p>Please join us, and help us create a world that lives up to these
expectations. With your <a href="https://fsfe.org/support/index.en.html">support</a>, we can do
it.</p>
