<h1>Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA)</h1>

<localmenu/>

<h3>What is the FLA?</h3>

<p>The Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA) is a copyright assignment that allows
one entity to safeguard all of the code created for a project by consolidating
copyright (or exclusive exploitation rights) to counteract copyright
fragmentation.</p>

<p>This enables projects to protect their legal maintainability by preserving
the ability to relicense code and ensuring sufficient rights to enforce
licences in court. The person assigning does not lose their rights to the
code either, as the FLA gives back unlimited usage/single exploitation rights
to the author. The FLA also applies a set of principles for the fiduciary.
If they breach these principles, all grants and licenses made to them
automatically expire.</p>

<p>The FLA is used for FSFE's <a href="fiduciary.html">Fiduciary Programme</a>.
It can also be adapted to assign the rights to any other third party.</p>

<p>The FLA was written by Dr. Axel Metzger (<a href="http://www.ifross.de">ifross</a>) and <a href="/about/greve/">Georg Greve</a> (<a href="http://fsfeurope.org">FSFE</a>) in consultation with renowned international legal and technical experts.   Parties ivolved in the evolution of the FLA included RA Dr. Till Jaeger, Carsten Schulz, Prof. Eben Moglen, RA Thorsten Feldmann, LL.M., Werner Koch, Alessandro Rubini, Reinhard Muller and others.  The latest revision was compiled by Georg Greve and FSFE's <a href="/projects/ftf/">FTF</a> coordinator <a href="/about/coughlan/">Shane M Coughlan</a> based on feedback provided by Dr. Lucie Guibault of the Institute for Information Law in the Netherlands.</p>
