    <title>Standards and patents at WIPO, Geneva, Switzerland</title>
    <body>
	For Free Software, a lot depends on the way in which
        standardisation organisations deal with patented
        technologies. The WIPO Standing Committee on the Law of
        Patents is the highest level forum dealing with this
        question. For FSFE, Karsten Gerloff and Hugo Roy will
        participate in the meeting to advance the interests of
        Free Software.
