    <p>Our work can be divided in four oftenly intertwined categories,
    represented on the timeline below. "Internal" presents the work accomplished
    to have a solid structure, carrying efficently the rest of FSFE's actions.
    "Policy" brings together successes brought by a continuous involvement in
    local, national and European law making processes. "Legal" presents the
    achievements of the Legal team, and "Public" lists the largest steps of our
    general advocacy work and campaigns.</p>
