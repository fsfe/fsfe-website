    <title>FSFE supports new antitrust investigation against Microsoft</title>
    <body>
      "Microsoft should be required openly, fully and faithfully to
      implement free and open industry standards," is the message of a
      letter by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) to European
      Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. To help achieve this goal, FSFE
      offered its support for a possible antitrust investigation based on
      the complaint of Opera Software against Microsoft. The complaint was
      based on anti-competitive behaviour in the web browser market.
