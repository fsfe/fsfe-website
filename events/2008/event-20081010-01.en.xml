	  <title>Zurich Fellowship meeting</title>
    <body>
	    There will be a Fellowship meeting at the FSFE Zurich office from 19:00 until 20:30 on Friday the 10th of October.  Some free (as in beer) beer will be provided and all Fellows nearby are invited to attend.  It will be a good chance to get to know each other in person, to discuss ways of spreading the word about Free Software in Switzerland, and to generally have a good time.  This meeting will be hosted by Benjamin Morant, FSFE's intern at the Zurich Office. If you are coming to the meeting please let Benjamin know by sending an email to morant@fsfeurope.org.
