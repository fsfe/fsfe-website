    <title>Office warming party, Berlin, Germany</title>
    <body>
		Since September KDE and FSFE have a joint office in Berlin. On December
		12th we will celebrate that at Linienstr. 141, 10115 Berlin with a nice
		year-end party starting at 6pm. If you plan to come please sent a note
		before December 7th to <a
			href="/about/people/kirschner/kirschner.html">Matthias</a> so that there
		is enough to drink. You can help us by bringing some Christmas cookies,
		too.
