    <h1>REUSE of Free Software</h1>

    <p><i>By lowering the barrier to reuse Free Software, we can entrench
       the position of Free Software as the foundation and default for all
       new software.</i></p>

    <p>FSFE is elaborating and promoting best practices for Free Software
    developers to encourage reuse of their software. Based on
    existing sources and the experience of our community, we want to show
    and encourage the practices we know make the process of reuse easier.
    </p>
    <p>
    The project is actively collecting sources of best practices from various
    writings, groups and organisations, from which we'll extract relevant
    practices and collate them into a shortlist of the most important ones.
    </p>
