 <h1>FSFE welcomes Germany's Federal Government's White Paper on "Secure Boot"</h1>
 
<p newsteaser="yes" id="introduction">Yesterday the German Ministry of the
Interior published a whitepaper about "Trusted Computing" and "Secure Boot".
The whitepapier says that "device owners must be in complete control of (able
to manage and monitor) all the trusted computing security systems of their
devices." This has been one of FSFE's key demands from the beginning. It
continues that "delegating this control to third parties requires conscious and
informed consent by the device owner".</p>
  
<p>FSFE's other demand, that before purchasing a device, buyers must be informed
concisely about the technical measures implemented in this device, as well as
the specific usage restrictions and their consequences for the owner, is also
addressed: "Trusted computing security systems must be deactivated (opt-in
principle)" when devices are delivered. "Based on the necessary transparency
with regard to technical features and content of trusted computing solutions,
device owners must be able to make responsible decisions when it comes to
product selection, start-up, configuration, operation and shut-down." And
"Deactivation must also be possible later (opt- out function) and must not have
any negative impact on the functioning of hard- and software that does not use
trusted computing functions."</p>
  
<blockquote><p>"It is an important step, that now government also take a firm
  stand on "Secure Boot" and "Trusted Computing". We as society have to make
  sure, that we are in control of our computers, so we can install arbitrary
  software and lastly to retain exclusive control over ones own data. Full,
  sole and permanent control over security subsystems is necessary for this.",
  says Matthias Kirschner, German Coordinator FSFE.</p></blockquote>
