<h1>I Love Free Software +++ Public authorities in Fediverse</h1>

<p>
  In this issue we invite public institutions to join free, 
  decentralised social networks. Watch our info-session on German 
  municipalities using Free Software. An FSFE volunteer doubts the 
  reliability of AI-generated text. I Love Free Software Day is just 
  around the corner. Celebrate with us!

<p>
  <a href="/news/2023/news-20230109-01.html">If public 
  bodies are on social networks they should also talk with Fediverse 
  users</a>. FediGov, the campaign of the FSFEâ€™s Swiss country team and 
  GNU/Linux.ch, asks public bodies to use Mastodon, Pixelfeld and 
  Peertube. Join the campaign and demand that your public institutions 
  use ethical communication channels. The <a href="https://social.network.europa.eu/@EU_Commission">European 
  Commission</a> and several <a href="https://social.network.europa.eu/directory">EU public 
  institutions</a> are already on Mastodon.

  Watermarks  that can verify whether a text was produced using AI, the 
  provision of sources that led to the output of the text, or the 
  count of back-references to a page can increase trust in AI- 
  generated texts, <a href="https://vl8r.eu/posts/2023/01/29/artificial-intelligence-is-not-willing-to-be-correct/">according

  <li>We have held several Upcycling Android workshops and now it is your turn! Do you want to organise a workshop and teach others how to flash phones? Check out our <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/uZZYCA31SzTT5bMpNaDzz3">train the trainers workshop</a>. Marvin, one of the speakers, said in a recent interview that despite the imperfections so far, <a href="https://www.c-radar.de/2022/12/c-radar-dezember-2022-android-alternativen-hacking-in-parallel/">GNU/Linux systems on phones have the highest potential to extend the life of devices</a> without running into security problems.</li>

<h3 id="groups">Groups</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Germany</strong>: The <a 
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/Bonn">FSFE local group in 
  Bonn</a> met online on 9 January. The group discussed how to make 
  large amounts of data (JSONs) searchable in a browser and how to 
  integrate Free Software Text-To-Speech into a blog. The question of 
  coding without a &#39;real&#39; computer led to a brief  look at 
  Android IDEs for mobile app development. Kilux and Chemnitzer Linux 
  Tage might be good opportunities to meet besides FrOScon. The group 
  is also interested in free musical instruments, this time featuring 
  an opentheremin. Meanwhile, the FSFE <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/Berlin">local group in 
  Berlin</a> was discussing with the youth Free Software in schools and 
  the benefits of the <a href="https://aleksis.org/">AlekSIS</a> 
  system.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Greece</strong>: In January the group discussed practices 
  about <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/Greece/2023-01-meeting">translating 
  Free Software into Greek</a>. The group shared collaborative 
  translation platforms and glossaries.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Netherlands</strong>: The government released the code of 
  DigiD, the identity verification app. This great news comes after 
  some months of advocacy by  the team.  <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/Netherlands/2023-01-18">This 
  victory was therefore the main topic of the last monthly meeting, in 
  January</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Switzerland</strong>: After a successful launch of the 
  FediGov campaign, the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/Zurich/2023-01-19">Zurich group 
  discussed next steps</a>. Creating a Mastodon instance for public 
  institutions in Switzerland or contacting data protection officers 
  are ongoing ideas.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Women</strong>: In January the FSFE Women group discussed the 
  Python tools <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Women/Notes">Conda, 
  Poetry, and mypy</a>.
</p>
