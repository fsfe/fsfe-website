      Free Software is about empowerment. When I was a student with little
      money, Linux enabled me to do interesting things with my cheap and old
      computer where the pre-installed software failed. Since then, my whole
      education and many achievements would have been impossible had I not been
      able to experiment, learn, disassemble, reassemble, modify, tweak, and
      use software the way I wanted. This kind of empowerment needs a strong
      lobby - the FSFE.
