    <title>Software Patents in Europe</title>
    <description>
      We are working towards a world where software does what software
      users want it to do. For this, software users must be able to
      participate in the development and distribution of the software.
      Software patents block this goal by adding legal and financial
      risks to software development and distribution and by giving the
      patent holders legal power to completely prohibit software
      developers from using the patented ideas.
