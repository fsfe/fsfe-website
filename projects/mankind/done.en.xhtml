  (question and answer were in French)</a></p>
  
  <p>In France, a work group was set to ask the UNESCO to schedule free
  software as world human heritage.</p>
  <p>RMS: What that means exactly?</p>
  <p>It would be a official recognition from UNESCO who is an
  international organization that free software is a world human heritage and
  should be protected as art work, like say, statues.</p>
  <p>RMS: Protected from software patents ?</p>
  <p>Protected from everything, from appropriation in general. What do you
  think of this initiative?</p>
  <p>RMS: As a general idea, it seems OK to me. It is really a human
  heritage. As a legal decision, I'd see the exact implications before giving
  an opinion. Because on details there could be problems. It is a question of
  details. That's why I asked what that means exactly. Because if it is a
  general idea, no problem, if it is a legal decision with specific
  consequences, one should see what will happen.</p></li>
