Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:17.160 --&gt; 00:21.240
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:21.240 --&gt; 00:24.760
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:24.760 --&gt; 00:30.640
I'm Bonnie Mering, and our guest for today's podcast is Amandine Jambert, also known as

00:30.640 --&gt; 00:31.640
Crypti.

00:31.640 --&gt; 00:37.880
Crypti has been using Free Software for nearly 20 years now, and she has been a volunteer

00:37.880 --&gt; 00:42.640
for the FSFE for exactly 10 years.

00:42.640 --&gt; 00:49.240
Crypti used to be a cryptographer, I think that's where the name came from, and now she is

00:49.240 --&gt; 00:50.840
a privacy specialist.

00:50.840 --&gt; 00:54.520
Welcome, Crypti, to the podcast, I'm very glad to have you here.

00:54.520 --&gt; 00:56.520
Thank you very much.

00:56.520 --&gt; 01:00.960
First of all, I do have an open or free question.

01:00.960 --&gt; 01:06.440
What are your first thoughts when you're here to term Free Software?

01:06.440 --&gt; 01:12.440
I didn't know what to do it, so I was like, I think the classical, what do you mean by

01:12.440 --&gt; 01:13.440
free?

01:13.440 --&gt; 01:20.400
Like, free, free, or free, free, so I think it was my first, you know, thing.

01:20.400 --&gt; 01:25.280
But hopefully I knew it in French, and so someone just said to me, it's a logistical

01:25.280 --&gt; 01:33.040
leap, and so it's like, okay, I know what it is, so it's okay, it's good, and in French

01:33.040 --&gt; 01:40.400
we use logistical leap, and so you already have the freedom in it, so then you just have

01:40.400 --&gt; 01:43.720
to understand which freedom you have, and that's nice.

01:43.720 --&gt; 01:47.920
Okay, thank you very much.

01:47.920 --&gt; 01:52.880
And before we dive into the topic of the podcast, which will be all about cryptography and

01:52.880 --&gt; 01:58.480
IT security, I would like to know how you got involved with the FSFE, because it's quite

01:58.480 --&gt; 02:00.920
a long time now.

02:00.920 --&gt; 02:09.000
In fact, I ended up on the FSCV website, and I was reading different stuff, and there

02:09.000 --&gt; 02:16.560
was this I love free software campaign, so it's just the best campaign on earth, and what

02:16.560 --&gt; 02:22.720
it isn't translated into French, and like a lot of the website was in French, but not

02:22.720 --&gt; 02:26.280
this campaign, and it was like, no, that's just not possible.

02:26.280 --&gt; 02:31.360
And there was this link on the bottom of the website saying, hey, if you want to translate

02:31.360 --&gt; 02:37.560
it, you have to do it, see this way, and so on, and so I sent it on email, and I said,

02:37.560 --&gt; 02:43.360
hey, I would like to translate, so I love free software campaign, and some nice people

02:43.360 --&gt; 02:48.360
on Twitter, since it was GitHub, and yeah, never left.

02:48.360 --&gt; 02:53.280
Okay, so, and how did you end up on the FSFE's website?

02:53.280 --&gt; 02:54.280
Undesley?

02:54.280 --&gt; 02:55.280
No idea.

02:55.280 --&gt; 02:56.280
No idea.

02:56.280 --&gt; 02:57.280
No idea.

02:57.280 --&gt; 03:03.360
I was already a like a denominator for the FSFE at that time, so I don't know if I was looking

03:03.360 --&gt; 03:09.960
for something, you know, looking for the FSFE website and ended up on the FSFE one, or

03:09.960 --&gt; 03:14.800
if I was looking for an answer to a question, I don't know, and I just discovered that

03:14.800 --&gt; 03:21.520
a, we have an European version of the FSFE, like, you know, I didn't know yet, you know,

03:21.520 --&gt; 03:26.200
how connected or not connected there, how separated there, and so on and so on, but it

03:26.200 --&gt; 03:29.040
was like, you know, a good start, and yeah.

03:29.040 --&gt; 03:30.040
Very nice.

03:30.040 --&gt; 03:36.040
I'm glad you ended up on the website, and I'm very glad you joined the translator's team.

03:36.040 --&gt; 03:37.040
Okay.

03:37.040 --&gt; 03:41.360
So let's go over to the topic, if that's all right with you.

03:41.360 --&gt; 03:44.800
My first question is, what does a cryptographer have to do?

03:44.800 --&gt; 03:45.800
Okay.

03:45.800 --&gt; 03:54.960
So, I initially was a kind of cryptographer who designed algorithm, and so my specialty was

03:54.960 --&gt; 03:57.600
designing protocol for privacy.

03:57.600 --&gt; 04:05.960
So for example, one of the kind of stuff I designed was what we call a sensible signature.

04:05.960 --&gt; 04:13.520
So it's, it's like, I will sign something, and you will, I will be able to say maybe

04:13.520 --&gt; 04:18.960
like, bunny, you will be able to change some parts of what I signed, and the signature

04:18.960 --&gt; 04:25.920
will be still a correct signature of me, and everything, thing will be fine, but if there

04:25.920 --&gt; 04:29.960
is a problem, we'll be able to say, no, since that wasn't the original money, it was

04:29.960 --&gt; 04:34.680
a correction from bunny, and so that's one of the kind of thing I did, so that's kind

04:34.680 --&gt; 04:41.840
of signature, but you can use this kind of thing in a more like global privacy way.

04:41.840 --&gt; 04:47.080
So you have a lot of very nice cryptography tools that exist, and you can, for example,

04:47.080 --&gt; 04:54.240
in choose, I don't know, I'm able to prove you that I am a certain age without giving

04:54.240 --&gt; 05:03.540
you my nine-post date, or I can prove you that I know, I'm a woman, I'm French, I'm

05:03.540 --&gt; 05:08.980
any attribute, or any information about these attributes, and with a minimum information,

05:08.980 --&gt; 05:10.820
and also a scan of things, you know.

05:10.820 --&gt; 05:18.940
So like private information, or any information that is signed, then it can be like traceback

05:18.940 --&gt; 05:19.940
to you.

05:19.940 --&gt; 05:26.860
No, it's, it's even nice on the dots, it's, it's won't be, it's more that I can mathematically

05:26.860 --&gt; 05:32.340
prove something to someone, and it will just, you know, I will be able to prove them

05:32.340 --&gt; 05:39.220
just the answer to a question without giving them any additional information.

05:39.220 --&gt; 05:41.420
That's the cryptographic idea.

05:41.420 --&gt; 05:44.180
You can apply it to anything, but that's the idea.

05:44.180 --&gt; 05:54.140
For example, okay, so we are in a nice place here in a university, and so we have a room

05:54.140 --&gt; 05:55.500
for this podcast.

05:55.500 --&gt; 06:02.300
So imagine I want to prove you that I have the key for the drawer here, which is not

06:02.300 --&gt; 06:04.900
the case, but imagine it's the case, okay?

06:04.900 --&gt; 06:05.900
Yeah, yeah.

06:05.900 --&gt; 06:10.940
Then I can show you the key, okay, that won't be zero knowledge stuff.

06:10.940 --&gt; 06:11.940
Okay.

06:11.940 --&gt; 06:13.940
But how do I know this is the key for the room?

06:13.940 --&gt; 06:15.460
Yeah, so that won't work.

06:15.460 --&gt; 06:20.180
I don't want you to show me the key, because I don't want you to be able to copy it,

06:20.220 --&gt; 06:25.660
I don't know, maybe you're, you know, I don't know, still my computer, but I don't know.

06:25.660 --&gt; 06:31.020
But I can prove you that I have the key just telling you, okay, close your eyes, and I close

06:31.020 --&gt; 06:35.940
the door, okay, I come back at the table, and then you can check and see that the door

06:35.940 --&gt; 06:38.100
is closed, okay?

06:38.100 --&gt; 06:44.100
So I never give you any more information than to fact that I am able to close the door.

06:44.100 --&gt; 06:45.100
Yeah.

06:45.100 --&gt; 06:46.500
And so that's the zero knowledge.

06:46.700 --&gt; 06:53.860
It suffices that I am able to prove you something without giving the information away.

06:53.860 --&gt; 06:54.860
Yes.

06:54.860 --&gt; 07:01.260
Okay, okay, I do think I understood it, we've worked on this, because this will be the

07:01.260 --&gt; 07:04.100
base of our podcast for today.

07:04.100 --&gt; 07:11.180
And now we have covered what cryptography is, and what is a privacy specialist?

07:11.180 --&gt; 07:20.980
So cryptography is, you know, it's the art of mathematics to ensure that you can, you

07:20.980 --&gt; 07:25.860
know, ensure confidentiality or ensures that you can identify something and so on and so on.

07:25.860 --&gt; 07:32.020
But it doesn't mean to apply it to something in particular, so you can, you know, use it

07:32.020 --&gt; 07:43.820
for cybersecurity in general, but you can also use it to protect as a privacy of individual.

07:43.820 --&gt; 07:51.820
So that was initially what I did during my PhD, so I was playing to privacy, and now I widened

07:51.820 --&gt; 07:52.820
the part of privacy.

07:52.820 --&gt; 08:01.580
I steal, I'm looking at a little bit of crypto stuff, but I also, I'm doing like IT

08:01.580 --&gt; 08:11.060
security stuff or looking at how, you know, how you can apply also a privacy law we have

08:11.060 --&gt; 08:20.300
in the EU to different technology, so maybe like in any technology, you can name it, and

08:20.300 --&gt; 08:26.140
then the question is how do you, how do you ensure that all the privacy law are correctly

08:26.140 --&gt; 08:32.820
applied using this technology, because the law is supposed to be neutral, and so it's

08:32.820 --&gt; 08:39.980
about protecting the data from people and making sure that the law is correctly enforced.

08:39.980 --&gt; 08:40.980
Yeah, yeah.

08:40.980 --&gt; 08:46.220
So it's also something with law in it and not only with cryptography anymore.

08:46.220 --&gt; 08:47.220
Yeah, exactly.

08:47.220 --&gt; 08:51.660
Now I want to like, in between both words.

08:51.660 --&gt; 08:53.660
And how do you find it to be in between?

08:54.220 --&gt; 08:55.220
That's nice.

08:55.220 --&gt; 08:56.220
Yes, yeah.

08:56.220 --&gt; 09:00.780
I mean, cryptographer are already like, if you ask a computer scientist, he will tell you

09:00.780 --&gt; 09:02.180
that we are mathematician.

09:02.180 --&gt; 09:05.460
If you ask mathematician, we say, oh, no way, there are computer scientists.

09:05.460 --&gt; 09:10.500
So now it's just like, no, it's another in between innovation.

09:10.500 --&gt; 09:15.100
And in fact, when you are thinking free software, it's also something that is in between

09:15.100 --&gt; 09:21.020
like your, you know, how do you mean, but all the time it's like we are speaking about

09:21.020 --&gt; 09:26.940
low, and we are speaking about ethic, and we are speaking about computer science.

09:26.940 --&gt; 09:32.780
So we also are, you know, like in between technical and legal software at the time.

09:32.780 --&gt; 09:33.780
Yeah.

09:33.780 --&gt; 09:35.780
Yeah, no, that's the true thought.

09:35.780 --&gt; 09:39.700
I'm talking about a tea and a tea security.

09:39.700 --&gt; 09:41.980
What does a tea security mean for you?

09:41.980 --&gt; 09:48.940
Like if you need to make a definition, how would you define a tea security?

09:48.940 --&gt; 09:57.140
It's very tough thing, but it's, it's all the things that will ensure the security of

09:57.140 --&gt; 10:04.660
information, informatics system, so and also, you know, the different computer and stuff

10:04.660 --&gt; 10:05.660
that we have.

10:05.660 --&gt; 10:11.700
It's very tough to phrase it in a way that every auditorium gets it, but I think it's, it's

10:11.700 --&gt; 10:12.700
the idea.

10:12.700 --&gt; 10:18.500
So securing the systems, the informatics system, I would say.

10:18.500 --&gt; 10:19.500
And our devices.

10:19.500 --&gt; 10:20.500
Yes.

10:20.500 --&gt; 10:22.500
So it's a very broad field.

10:22.500 --&gt; 10:23.500
Yes.

10:23.500 --&gt; 10:27.340
And what's your favorite part about it?

10:27.340 --&gt; 10:28.340
Favorite part.

10:28.340 --&gt; 10:35.260
I think the privacy part, of course, I mean, IT security and privacy security is like,

10:35.260 --&gt; 10:42.700
you know, 80% common and 20% very different, because it depends what you want to protect.

10:42.700 --&gt; 10:49.340
And so the part I like is everything that is, you know, privacy related.

10:49.340 --&gt; 10:57.780
So would you say that it's possible to have a secure system that protects all the privacy

10:57.780 --&gt; 11:02.540
or do you think this is like impossible to achieve?

11:02.540 --&gt; 11:06.380
I know it's a mean question, but there's no 100% security.

11:06.380 --&gt; 11:09.100
Yeah, perfect security doesn't exist.

11:09.100 --&gt; 11:16.220
If you can have enough security considering your situation, maybe depending on your situation,

11:16.220 --&gt; 11:21.540
but you have to, you know, be quite clear about what your situation is.

11:21.540 --&gt; 11:30.020
But yeah, the perfect security is either not possible or just not like lifeable.

11:30.020 --&gt; 11:39.060
I mean, you would need to impose on yourself some very, very tough rules and tough assumption

11:39.340 --&gt; 11:44.500
to ensure that you already, you know, have the highest level of security.

11:44.500 --&gt; 11:48.500
And at the same time, you just want to, you know, live your life.

11:48.500 --&gt; 11:50.820
And it's just no more practical.

11:50.820 --&gt; 11:57.420
So it's perfect that you should not be for must be poignant in most situations,

11:57.420 --&gt; 11:59.740
not something that you are aiming for.

11:59.740 --&gt; 12:04.820
You should aim for something that is okay for you, like, yeah.

12:04.820 --&gt; 12:09.060
That you say, okay, I'm comfortable with this level of security.

12:09.060 --&gt; 12:10.180
And I'm okay.

12:10.180 --&gt; 12:15.020
And I'm very that some data might be leaked and that I'm not able to protect everything.

12:15.020 --&gt; 12:15.900
Yeah, exactly.

12:15.900 --&gt; 12:18.180
It's what we call straight modeling.

12:18.180 --&gt; 12:25.660
So we are every one of us should, you know, decide what is the level of, you know,

12:25.660 --&gt; 12:31.540
privacy, the need and their comfortable ways and try to help for it.

12:31.540 --&gt; 12:32.540
Okay.

12:32.540 --&gt; 12:34.220
I see.

12:34.220 --&gt; 12:39.100
And talking about security, would you say free software is more secure than non free software

12:39.100 --&gt; 12:42.980
because I'm quite sure you have heard this argument before.

12:42.980 --&gt; 12:48.940
As soon as you start talking with some people that are very intimate free software and quite

12:48.940 --&gt; 12:54.500
cool because I'm also into free software, they start arguing that free software is more

12:54.500 --&gt; 12:58.260
secure because of the poor freedoms.

12:58.260 --&gt; 13:03.220
And I was wondering as a privacy specialist and as a person who has a lot of experience

13:03.220 --&gt; 13:08.900
with IT security and cryptography, would you say that this is true or not true?

13:08.900 --&gt; 13:11.180
I think it's more complex than that.

13:11.180 --&gt; 13:12.180
Yes.

13:12.180 --&gt; 13:18.420
I mean, do I believe that the most secure stuff are free software?

13:18.420 --&gt; 13:19.420
Yes.

13:19.420 --&gt; 13:23.820
Do I consider that some free software are really insecure?

13:23.820 --&gt; 13:24.820
Also yes.

13:25.060 --&gt; 13:31.180
To have something that is secure, you need it to be audited and checked.

13:31.180 --&gt; 13:36.500
And you need to have some people who will check on it and will answer to the things that

13:36.500 --&gt; 13:39.140
are being found and so on and so on.

13:39.140 --&gt; 13:47.100
So you need a lot of things and a lot of conditions in order to have something that is, you know,

13:47.100 --&gt; 13:50.020
very secure at the end.

13:50.020 --&gt; 13:58.580
And free software helps because it's a lot more people to do this, those audits.

13:58.580 --&gt; 14:05.420
It's a lot to way more people to read the code and to discover that there is something,

14:05.420 --&gt; 14:11.860
you know, I may stupid or intentionally, you know, bad in it and so on.

14:12.860 --&gt; 14:21.860
And it also, you know, provides a system in a lot of cases where people will, you know,

14:21.860 --&gt; 14:29.340
will be used to answer to critics from outside, like they are used to to receive people saying,

14:29.340 --&gt; 14:33.380
hey, you should change that or there is a bug there and so on.

14:33.380 --&gt; 14:40.820
So they have the tool to hear when someone comes and say, hey, I have found a vulnerability

14:40.820 --&gt; 14:44.580
on your system or on your software.

14:44.580 --&gt; 14:50.700
And so they already have the tools to untware it and to correct it and so on.

14:50.700 --&gt; 14:58.260
So it's more a question that free software have a lot of, you know, things that are very

14:58.260 --&gt; 15:02.740
good to provide highly secure software.

15:02.740 --&gt; 15:11.020
But it doesn't mean that all software are secured because first, a lot of free software

15:11.020 --&gt; 15:14.740
are just and will never be audited.

15:14.740 --&gt; 15:19.860
Like nobody will look at the codes or they will look at some people will look, but that

15:19.860 --&gt; 15:26.540
just some part to maybe add an API or maybe add a new functionality on some, but nobody

15:26.540 --&gt; 15:30.540
will look at whether it's secure or not.

15:30.540 --&gt; 15:39.420
And if nobody will look at it, then probably there are a lot of pollinates, that's one thing.

15:39.420 --&gt; 15:45.300
Another thing is, sadly, a lot of projects are under found.

15:45.300 --&gt; 15:50.980
And so the people are very stressed and they may have a lot of things to do.

15:50.980 --&gt; 15:58.180
And so they might, they might sometimes just say, okay, we don't have, you know, enough

15:58.180 --&gt; 16:05.820
time or enough means in general to to check everything.

16:05.820 --&gt; 16:13.140
And they might, you know, have shortcuts and so not be as secure as they might be.

16:13.140 --&gt; 16:23.300
And so it's, so yeah, so for me, the best software and the most secure one are free software.

16:23.300 --&gt; 16:31.180
And but sadly, all free software are not as secure as we wish it to be.

16:31.180 --&gt; 16:32.180
Yeah, that's true.

16:32.180 --&gt; 16:37.340
No, thank you very much for the explanation and I do quite agree with this kind of complex

16:37.340 --&gt; 16:40.180
approach.

16:40.180 --&gt; 16:46.420
Another thing I often hear is people argue that non-free software is more secure because

16:46.420 --&gt; 16:51.420
people do not know how the code is written and what the code does exactly.

16:51.420 --&gt; 16:54.660
And this is called security by obscurity.

16:54.660 --&gt; 17:04.060
Okay, I'm a cryptographer, cryptography, security by obscurity has been like debunked for

17:04.580 --&gt; 17:08.260
I will be nearly half a century.

17:08.260 --&gt; 17:14.580
At the time, we just, you know, realized that's the best crypto, best algorithm, but since

17:14.580 --&gt; 17:20.380
whether one that's everyone will look at it and will try to either attack it or attack

17:20.380 --&gt; 17:24.740
the proof because in some case, you have some mathematical proof beyond your, your schemes

17:24.740 --&gt; 17:25.740
and so on and so on.

17:25.740 --&gt; 17:32.620
And those are the cryptos that we consider as, you know, like, no, the most secure one.

17:32.620 --&gt; 17:34.860
And it's the same with obscurity.

17:34.860 --&gt; 17:41.860
I don't mean that you should, you know, give your private key to everyone.

17:41.860 --&gt; 17:44.380
It absolutely not the case.

17:44.380 --&gt; 17:49.860
And even though you will use free software, maybe you will like not, you know, show to

17:49.860 --&gt; 17:53.700
everyone what is your configuration, what's the parameter you are using and so on.

17:53.700 --&gt; 17:56.340
So that is a thing, but there is two different things.

17:56.340 --&gt; 18:02.060
It's, do you need free software and the way you apply free software and your system, do

18:02.060 --&gt; 18:09.300
you need it to be like perfectly 100% transparent in the means that you will give every, you know,

18:09.300 --&gt; 18:12.340
implementation data, every parameter you are using and so on.

18:12.340 --&gt; 18:15.380
That's two different things.

18:15.380 --&gt; 18:22.100
You will be, in most cases, the one who, you know, brought the code you are using, you

18:22.100 --&gt; 18:28.020
will, you know, use some software for someone, someone else.

18:28.020 --&gt; 18:34.380
How can you be confident that this free software, this software, by default, in general?

18:34.380 --&gt; 18:40.300
This software is first, doing what you say we say is doing.

18:40.300 --&gt; 18:47.100
And third, that is doing it in a, you know, nice way.

18:47.100 --&gt; 18:55.140
Okay, if you can't look at the code, if nobody can look at the code, if nobody did not,

18:55.140 --&gt; 19:02.660
then you're screwed like you can't know whether it's, you know, if it's really doing what

19:02.660 --&gt; 19:05.260
it's supposed to do or not.

19:05.260 --&gt; 19:13.060
And so, okay, so you will, you know, put all those black box in your system and then you

19:13.060 --&gt; 19:14.500
will say that it's more secure.

19:14.500 --&gt; 19:15.500
I disagree.

19:15.500 --&gt; 19:24.380
I mean, I prefer to have a feeling, yes, I want, you know, be sure at 100% of every, you

19:24.380 --&gt; 19:29.860
know, every box I will put in my system, but I, I will be reasonably sure for most of

19:29.860 --&gt; 19:30.860
that.

19:30.860 --&gt; 19:36.820
And then, yes, I might not give you all my, you know, on the data of the infrastructure

19:36.820 --&gt; 19:41.300
on which, you know, which thing I will be using and so on, but it's, it's more a question

19:41.300 --&gt; 19:47.660
of how I will, you know, put it in my system, so it will stay.

19:47.660 --&gt; 19:51.460
So there is very, you know, two separate things for me.

19:51.540 --&gt; 19:59.420
Yeah, the one is like you do not need to be 100% transparent and you do also need, but

19:59.420 --&gt; 20:04.180
you need to be transparent on some level and that people know how to code works and let

20:04.180 --&gt; 20:10.940
people know how they, how the software is coded and works.

20:11.660 --&gt; 20:17.900
Yeah, because if you don't know how the software works and you don't know what it's, you

20:17.900 --&gt; 20:23.300
know, what is doing with your data, what is doing with your, you know, your system,

20:23.300 --&gt; 20:31.380
like, you know, that's, it's, in fact, you are implementing in your system, something

20:31.380 --&gt; 20:36.540
that might be a threat, like, you know, so, yeah, just free software.

20:39.740 --&gt; 20:44.820
I think after we have played up all the prejudice against free software and IT security,

20:44.980 --&gt; 20:50.500
I was wondering, you already mentioned that a bit, what do you think we need to make software

20:50.500 --&gt; 20:51.500
more secure?

20:52.020 --&gt; 20:56.900
We did do teaching when it people paid for auditing stuff.

20:56.900 --&gt; 21:03.860
And in fact, both from an IT security point of view and from a privacy point of view,

21:03.860 --&gt; 21:09.460
because it's, other was saying earlier, it's 80% comment and 20% very different.

21:09.940 --&gt; 21:18.580
And so we need more and more auditing and it means that we need, yeah, I know it's always the

21:18.580 --&gt; 21:28.580
same, but we need money for that. But there, you know, we start to see some initiative from,

21:28.580 --&gt; 21:36.980
you know, at the open level or in the US, you know, pushing for auditing stuff and like

21:36.980 --&gt; 21:44.740
auditing free software, so providing money for that. And I think if we called in an ideal world,

21:44.740 --&gt; 21:52.100
all the biggest audits, not biggest in line of code, but in biggest in, in fact,

21:52.100 --&gt; 22:01.780
there are the more used, liberate/software should be at least audited at least once every few

22:02.740 --&gt; 22:12.180
years. And that will help everyone. And that is one thing. And the other is, you had some

22:12.180 --&gt; 22:19.860
very interesting academic work on developers. And I look specifically, you know, quite recently,

22:19.860 --&gt; 22:30.820
about how they deal with passwords. And they study, they, you know, ask developer to write some,

22:30.820 --&gt; 22:37.300
some codes to deal with passwords, some authentication codes. And for a part of them, they just had

22:37.300 --&gt; 22:44.100
to do it. And for parts of them, they tell them, you have to, to ensure that it's secure.

22:45.060 --&gt; 22:53.620
Just a few words, like something just general. And both did, the bus group ended up doing something

22:53.620 --&gt; 23:02.420
very different. I mean, the one where, the one who have been said, you know, to take care of

23:02.420 --&gt; 23:09.300
security, did it in more secure way, but like very more secure way. Why the other one did something

23:09.300 --&gt; 23:17.620
that works, but works like being very, very efficient, but not secure. I think in, from a lot of

23:17.620 --&gt; 23:25.700
developer, they are thinking about functionality, about insurance, I think our smooths are, you know,

23:25.700 --&gt; 23:31.940
are working pretty well. And security is not considered as a functionality or not considered as

23:31.940 --&gt; 23:37.380
something, you know, that's, you know, stains on mind. That's something that's, you know, they should

23:37.380 --&gt; 23:44.580
think about. So I think it's also a question of, you know, like in the future, more and more people

23:44.580 --&gt; 23:51.460
will, you know, will have them all those privacy and security questions in the back of their minds.

23:51.460 --&gt; 23:57.860
And then it will move on. So both a question of audits, you know, the two, you know, have all the,

23:57.860 --&gt; 24:05.220
you know, so you change, you also think that the, the mindset of developers has to change a bit

24:05.220 --&gt; 24:13.540
or it's changing. And because I see security has become such a huge topic that they think about

24:13.540 --&gt; 24:24.820
that security by coding. I think, yeah. I hope so. I also think that we, in the EU, we are

24:24.820 --&gt; 24:31.140
lucky enough to have very strong privacy low. And I think that's the fact that we have those low

24:31.140 --&gt; 24:38.180
and we are talking a lot about those low. And we have those big sanctions sometimes and so

24:38.980 --&gt; 24:48.580
are, you know, like, you know, updating the moral software of people doing all those stuff

24:48.580 --&gt; 24:53.860
because it's not just developers, it's groups, it's a community doing all those projects. And the

24:53.860 --&gt; 25:00.980
fact that they are considering this is something important. And so I have a lot of hope.

25:01.780 --&gt; 25:09.860
For the future. Me too. Okay, my last question. You have already mentioned that I love

25:09.860 --&gt; 25:16.820
free software campaign. Yeah. And I know that you have translated it. And so I'm quite sure,

25:16.820 --&gt; 25:23.060
you know, that we have this every year on the 14th of February. And we use this day to say thank

25:23.060 --&gt; 25:28.900
you to some developers or photographers or other people that contribute to free software.

25:29.540 --&gt; 25:36.420
And I was wondering if you would like to give me the honor of saying thank you to a free software

25:36.420 --&gt; 25:45.140
project. Yeah, I will, you know, boss will thanks everyone that is not writing code because you're

25:45.140 --&gt; 25:51.460
often forgotten. So I love people who write codes. It's not what I'm saying. I also, you know,

25:51.540 --&gt; 25:57.700
thank you, all the one who, you know, tons of late stuff who ensures that you have very nice,

25:58.340 --&gt; 26:03.780
you know, design interface and so on and so on. That's just so nice. So thank you very much.

26:03.780 --&gt; 26:09.700
And if I have to pick one project, I will pick keep us. It's not the first time that I did it for

26:09.700 --&gt; 26:18.180
I love free software day. I know. But it's like, you know, I'm using it for like 15 years, I think.

26:18.180 --&gt; 26:25.540
And it's, it's, yeah, it's something I can't, I can't survive without, you know, something to,

26:25.540 --&gt; 26:33.460
yeah. So thank you. Thank you very much for your time, Crypti. You're welcome. And I hope to see you

26:33.460 --&gt; 26:42.340
again in the future, maybe on the podcast. Yeah, up so. Bye. Bye. This was the software freedom
