	  Software is running the world. All aspects of our life are controlled
	  and steered by software which is running on local devices or somewhere
	  remote, in the cloud. If we want to have an open and democratic
	  society then it is key to have full transparency how this software
	  works. This includes the rights to study it, to change it, to
	  distribute it and run it wherever we want. Free Software is the only
	  concept which ensures these rights. I’m a happy supporter of the Free
	  Software Foundation Europe because the FSFE promotes these values
	  which are so important for our future.
