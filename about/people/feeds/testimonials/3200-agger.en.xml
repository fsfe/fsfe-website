      I was a solitary voice for years, explaining the principles behind Free
      Software and its importance for people in my country in numerous articles
      and blog posts. I wanted to belong to an organization with the goal of
      building the digital society on 100% free software, and supporting the
      FSFE and gaining access to its blogging and fellowship infrastructure
      seemed like a logical first step.
