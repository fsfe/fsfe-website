		<h1>How we celebrate "I Love Free Software Day" in Potteries, UK</h1>

<p>Every year "I Love Free Software Day" is celebrated, where 
we thank all Free Software contributors for their commitment 
to use, study, share and improve Free Software. Without them there is no 
software freedom. We want to thank them all for contributing to Free 
Software &lt;3</p>

<p>To mark this special occasion the <a href="/about/groups.html">FSFE's 
local groups</a> organise local events and celebrations. Each 
celebration is unique and showcases the commitment of our community, from local gatherings with pizza and fun Free Software games 
to larger events addressing new people with talks and networking.</p>

<p>One local group has been celebrating “I Love Free Software Day” for 
the past 3 years – <a href="https://docs.fsfe.org/en/LocalGroups/Active/Potteries/Potteries"> 
that group is in The Potteries, UK</a>. 
This local group had its origins back in 1999, when 
a local Linux user group started organising meetings, talks and 
many other activities. In 2019 members of the local LUG met a long-term volunteer 
from the FSFE at a conference in Manchester. They hit it off and 
began a new era by talking exclusively about Free Software with a new local FSFE 
group being run alongside the Linux group. For six years this local group has stayed active 
and participated in various FSFE activities. Read more about the only 
FSFE local group in the UK and their celebration of the “I Love 
Free Software Day”.</p>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: How many people are active in the group ? Can you 
also give us an overview of what Potteries is?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Steven, One of the FSFE Potteries coordinators</strong>: It is 
tough to put a number on it as we communicate through lots of different 
channels, but it is not uncommon to see more than a dozen regulars at 
meetings, plus new faces that often then become new regulars!</p>

<p>We are situated right in the middle of England between Manchester and 
Birmingham. Most of the urban area of North Staffordshire is known as 
‘The Potteries’ due to the city of Stoke-on-Trent and the surrounding 
towns being historically instrumental in the ceramic industry. It is a 
name that everyone local knows and understands, which is why we chose 
it. It is not uncommon to see many local groups using ‘Potteries’ in 
their names, and the FSFE President signed off on our group with that name!</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What are the usual activities the Potteries local group does?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Steven</strong>: Online the activities are mostly just 
organising meetings, people sharing their experiences, and offering help 
and recommendations where they can. Workshop meetings involve using Free 
Software itself and attending talks given by anyone who fancies sharing 
their knowledge. We also have socials particularly in the summer, as 
well as trips to unconferences such as Oggcamp. Our main 
annual event is ILoveFS, but we also help to run other events like the 
Flörgåsbord! event too.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: When was the first time you celebrated the “I 
Love Free Software Day”, and how did it work out?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Steven</strong>: The first time was Tuesday 14 February 2023, 
for which initially we thought the date worked really well. This is because 
we cooperatively take turns to run meetings on Tuesday evenings with 
other similar local groups, increasing turnout as attendees always know 
to keep that evening free. We also used the same location that we used 
for formal scheduled talks, which was not really a particularly social 
venue, more like a computer lab.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that is also Valentine's Day, and people in the UK take it 
quite seriously, and so the turnout was not great! We often got told 
that their significant others would lynch them if they did not spend the 
evening with them!</p>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: How did the celebration of the “I Love Free 
Software Day” evolve over the next years and what was your personal 
highlight while celebrating this special day?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Steven</strong>: Well in subsequent years we were told we could 
use a date near to the 14th instead! So doing that, together with using a 
great new sociable space, it has meant things have worked perfectly ever 
since! I would have to say my personal highlight was playing the games 
at the ILoveFS 2025 event, that really helped to bring people together 
competing as teams, rather than lots of little groups talking amongst 
themselves.</p>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What did you do for the I Love Free software Day 2025?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Steven</strong>: Well we had the upstairs room of the KPA 
Clubhouse (on the Keele University campus) which is a great free venue 
with plenty of character and comfortable seating. The room was decorated 
with plenty of balloons and promotional material, as well as laptops 
loaded with Free Software that people could just pick up and try. Add to 
that some great company, as well as free food and drinks, and it was a 
brilliant atmosphere for playing the Free Software quiz game, a quick 
presentation, and socialising about our love of Free Software, 
particularly those often forgotten smaller and hidden projects we take 
for granted.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: What would you recommend to others when they want 
to organise “I Love Free Software Day” celebrations, and what are 
pitfalls you would say should be avoided? 
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Steven</strong>: The first thing I would say is that if your 
event is not set up to easily explain what Free Software is and why it 
is important, to literally anyone walking in off the street, then you’re 
not doing it right! Accessibility of the topic is key, so if you have 
got a few spare laptops to run software that people will find familiar, 
but perhaps did not associate with Free Software, that’s a great start! 
Add to that some welcoming regulars who have the patience and skill to 
explain things without confusion (or fighting about which distro is 
better!) and you’re already off to a winning start. Try to steer 
conversations away from being too heavy, keep things social and 
lighthearted, and offer people comfortable seating, drinks, and food to 
get them willing to open up about their experiences.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: Why do you think I Love Free Software Day is 
important and why should everybody be celebrating this day?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Steven</strong>: Free Software should be celebrated and 
appreciated just as much as the concepts of democracy, the rule of law, 
equal opportunities, and the free exchange of other information than 
just Software! Things that people take for granted but took years of 
work to establish constantly need defending. It is a great way to 
remind people that lots of community spirit has gone into creating the 
tools we use every day, which are often more and more powered by software.</p>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Do you already have plans for celebrating “I Love Free Software Day 2026”?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Steven</strong>: Yes, it'll be on the 10th February for 2026. Since the venue we used for 
the least two years has been a great success, we’ll be looking to 
mostly replicate that again in 2026 but this time with the focus on 
thanking maintainers.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Steven, Thank you very much for your time!</p>
