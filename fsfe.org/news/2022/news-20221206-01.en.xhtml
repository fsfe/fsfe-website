<h1>EU Declaration of Digital Rights and Principles falls short of its ambitions </h1>

<p>
Member states, the European Parliament, and the Commission have reached 
a consensus on the Declaration of Digital Rights and Principles. 
Although it aims to serve as a reference point for the digital 
transformation of Europe, it instead descends into murky waters, 
causing ambiguity. Its wording is unclear and it overlooks existing 
good proposals.

<p>
Whereas the EU institutions claim that digital sovereignty and openness 
are crucial for the digital transformation of Europe, the  declaration 
lacks clear definition of such values. The <a 
href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-declaration-digital-rights-and-principles" 
> text</a> of the declaration makes reference to promoting 
interoperability, open technologies and standards. However, it is not 
clear what exactly the signatory institutions mean with such wording. 
By contrast, the European Parliament proposal had a clear reference to 
Free Software as a way to ensure transparency in the use of algorithms 
and artificial intelligence, as well as the importance of Open 
Standards. Unfortunately, this wording failed to be upheld during the 
inter-institutional negotiations, and the final text ended up being 
rather unclear.

<p>
<blockquote><em>
“In a fast-pace digitalised society, the importance of such declaration 
of digital rights is crucial. This text will serve as a benchmark for 
decision makers in the journey of shaping our digital sphere. It is 
problematic for our software freedom that such declaration lacks clear 
definitions and that solid existing frameworks are not being taken into 
consideration”,</em> explains Lina Ceballos, FSFE Policy Project Manager. 
</blockquote>
</p>


<p> 
It is also not clear if the declaration is consistent with existing 
frameworks. According to its text, it is built upon previous 
initiatives such as the Berlin and <a 
href="/news/2017/news-20170710-01.html"> Tallinn</a> declarations. 
These aforementioned frameworks already refer to Free Software when it 
comes to digital sovereignty and interoperability, while they also 
require more use of Free Software, and strengthening the requirement 
for its use. However, when it comes to interoperability, Free Software 
is not explicitly mentioned in the Declaration of Digital Rights and 
Principles.
</p>

<p> 
<blockquote>
Last but not least, <em> “the declaration misses to name reusability of 
software and hardware through Free Software licenses as an important 
step towards a more sustainable digital society. Having said this, the 
current negotiations about the Ecodesign Directive will have to do it 
right where the declaration falls short”</em> says Erik Albers, FSFE's 
Digital Sustainability Program Manager.
