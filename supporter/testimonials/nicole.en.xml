            I'm interested in values, politics, society; in new forms of 
            production, based on free co-operation in egalitarian structures; in 
            knowledge commons and collective intelligence. That's why I'm here and 
            why I wish to support the free software movement. I have no technical 
            background, and neither do most of the people I know.
