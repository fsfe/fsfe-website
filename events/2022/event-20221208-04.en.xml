        <title>FSFE Women December online meeting with talk (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>FSFE Women is a group for women* who are interested in Free Software. We get together about once in a month online to meet, give talks about topics we find interesting in the area of Free Software and discuss recent developments. The group is women-centric and open to all women, inter, trans and non-binary people. </p>
      <p>This time the meeting will start with Fani Partsafyllidou, Project Manager at FSFE, presenting the Upcycling Android initiative. Then we will discuss decentralized and independent alternative events of 37c3 and in which way we can participate / celebrate the event. The meeting is in English. We start at 7:30 pm (Europe/Berlin) and usually stay together for ~ 2 hours. For other timezones look here: https://notime.zone/NI89qTIWLUw7h. You are welcome to join in our BBB-Room https://conf.fsfe.org/b/women</p>
