<h1>Statement on Richard Stallman rejoining the FSF board</h1>

<p>
  We learnt through a public announcement that Richard Stallman is
  again part of the board of directors of the Free Software Foundation,
  one of our independent sister organisations. We disapprove of this
  step that came without any message of remorse or willingness to
  change.
</p>

<p>
  In 2019, Richard Stallman resigned as president and board member of
  the Free Software Foundation. On 21 March 2021 Stallman announced he
  is member of the board again. The FSFE only learnt about that fact
  through his public announcement.
</p>

<p>
  We believe this step and how it was communicated harms the future of
  the Free Software movement. The goal of the software freedom movement
  is to empower all people to control technology and thereby create a
  better society for everyone. Free Software is meant to serve everyone
  regardless of their age, ability or disability, gender identity, sex,
  ethnicity, nationality, religion or sexual orientation. This requires
  an inclusive and diverse environment that welcomes all contributors
  equally. The FSFE realises that we ourselves and the Free Software
  movement still have to work hard to be that place where everyone
  feels safe and respected to participate in it in order to fulfill the
  movement's mission.
</p>

<p>
  One crucial factor in making our community more inclusive is to
  recognise and reflect when other people are offended or harmed by our
  own actions and consider this feedback in future actions. The way
  Richard Stallman announced his return to the board unfortunately
  lacks any acknowledgement of this kind of thought process, and we are
  deeply disappointed that the FSF board did not address these concerns
  before electing him a board member again. Overall, we feel the
  current step sends the wrong signal to existing and future community
  members.
</p>

<p>
  That is why, as a legally and financially independent organisation,
  in which Richard Stallman has not had any decision-making powers, we
  call for his resignation from all FSF bodies. The FSF needs to
  seriously reflect on this decision as well as their decision-making
  process to prevent similar issues from happening again. Therefore, in
  the current situation we see ourselves unable to collaborate both
  with the FSF and any other organisation in which Richard Stallman has
  a leading position. Instead, we will continue to work with groups and
  individuals who foster diversity and equality in the Free Software
  movement in order to achieve our joint goal of empowering all users
  to control technology.
