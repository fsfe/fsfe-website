   <p> Will you be able to read your documents 20 years from now? Every day, millions of computer users like you edit text and spreadsheets, take pictures and record audio and video. What if you couldn't read your private letters anymore, or even open that album with pictures from your honeymoon? What if you couldn't exchange those files with friends, because the software used by each one of you can't talk to each other? To help you make your documents future-proof, we celebrate Document Freedom Day. </p>

    <h2>Free your documents, save your information!</h2>
<p><a href="http://documentfreedom.org/">Document Freedom Day</a> (DFD) is a global day for document liberation. Is is about helping you to really own your data and raising awareness of the public for the importance of Open Document Formats and <a href="/freesoftware/standards/standards.html">Open Standards</a> in general. During one month, FSFE spreads the word on open document formats and Open Standards, publishing information, talking to the press, telling people in the surronding about it, and spreading the DFD logo all over theInternet. On the very date of Document Freedom Day, FSFE organizes day activities all over the world with partner organizations and volunteers. </p>
 
<h2>Open Standards</h2>
<p>Any person can save documents in open document formats, which are based on <a href="/freesoftware/standards/standards.html">Open Standards</a>, and be sure that people will be able to read those files, independently from the software they use. Open Standards are essential for interoperability and freedom of choice based on the merits of different software applications. They provide freedom from data lock-in and the subsequent vendor lock-in. This makes Open Standards essential for governments, companies, organisations and individual users of information technology. If you also want to protect your freedoms, you have <a href="/news/2010/news-20100302-01.html">lots of possibilities to participate to Document Freedom Day</a>.</p>
