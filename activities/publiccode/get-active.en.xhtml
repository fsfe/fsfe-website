	<p>One of the best ways to make an impact and promote Free Software use in public institutions is to get active and approaching political representatives to share the topic.</p>
</div>
<h2>Identifying candidates</h2>
<p>Identifying candidates is the first step to start the debate. Research political parties and their platforms, together with institutional websites. It is important that you identify the candidate(s) running for election in your area, as they represent you based on your residence, and have a more direct relation with their constituents. Then, you can look for local political events happening around your area. In the run-up to the elections, there will be round-table discussions, election booths and debates with candidates. Party websites often provide information about these events, along information about their candidates . Additionally, seek recommendations from local Free Software advocacy <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/">groups or communities</a>, as they might take part in or organise meetings related to the European elections.</p>
<h2>Approaching Candidates</h2>
<p>Once you have found the right event to take part in, you can kick off the conversation starting with the <a href="/freesoftware/">basics</a>. Ask candidates if they know what Free Software is and tell them why it is important for a democratic society. Free Software is also an important topic when it comes to Public Administrations: you can use the following three arguments to explain why:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Free and Open Source Software is a modern public good that allows everybody to freely use, understand, share and improve applications we use on a daily basis.</li>
	<li>Free and Open Source Software licences provide safeguards against being locked in to services from specific companies that use restrictive licences to hinder competition.</li>
	<li>Free and Open Source Software ensures that the source code is accessible so that backdoors and security holes can be fixed without depending on one service provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mention the “<a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money? Public Code!</a>” Campaign and ask the candidates a position on the topic. Make then use of that answer to let also other EU citizens know about candidates’ position on Free Software. You can also find <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword">informative material</a> in our website. All the material can be printed or requested for free through our request form. This material can be useful to have a basic and simple understanding of Free Software and can be easily shared. Make use of it!</p>
<p>If you are not able to join any event in person, you can also write an email to your local candidate and ask their position on Free Software. Below is a draft email template for reference:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Dear [Candidate's Name],</p>
	<p>As a constituent invested in promoting Free Software and digital freedoms, I am reaching out to inquire about your stance on this topic, particularly in public administrations. Free Software (also known as Open Source) empowers people to control technology by granting four freedoms to each user:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The freedom to use software for any purpose, without geographical limitations</li>
		<li>The freedom to understand software, without any non-disclosure agreement</li>
		<li>The freedom to share software and copy it at no cost</li>
		<li>The freedom to improve software and share the improvements</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In this regard, Free Software plays a vital role in fostering transparency, innovation, and equitable access to technology in a democratic society.</p>
	<p>I would greatly appreciate it if you could share your views on the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What is your position on the demand that software whose development was financed or co-financed by public funds should always be published under a free software license in order to make it freely available to citizens and companies?</li>
		<li>What is your position on the demand that all public administrations should gradually switch to software that is available to everyone for unrestricted use, editing and distribution (free/open source software)?</li>
		<li>Do you support initiatives like publiccode.eu, which advocates for the adoption of Free Software in public administration?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I believe that embracing Free Software principles is essential for fostering a more inclusive and democratic digital ecosystem. Your insights on this matter would greatly inform my voting decision in the upcoming election.</p>
	<p>Thank you for considering these questions, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
	<p>Sincerely,<br/>
	[Your Name]</p>

<h2>Being Active, also on Social Media</h2>
<p>We encourage you to use social media platforms as well to amplify your message and engage a broader audience. Share informative content about Free Software, emphasize open standards' importance, and advocate for policies prioritizing digital freedoms. Use hashtags like #publiccode, to join discussions and encourage others to do the same, emphasizing Free Software's significance in shaping a more transparent and democratic society. Use our <a href="https://sharepic.fsfe.org/#pmpc">share-pic generator</a> and share why you support our “Public Money? Public Code!” campaign. Share it on social media and on other platforms and tell others to do the same.</p>
<p>Here a toot for example you can use:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I believe in the value of #FreeSoftware!<br />
	Let’s act together for #SoftwareFreedom: the right to use, understand, improve, and share the code of the digital tools we use everyday! Share your share-pic and tell why you believe in #publiccode! More information on fsfe.org and publiccode.eu</p>
