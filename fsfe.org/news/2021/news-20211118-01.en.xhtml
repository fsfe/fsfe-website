  <h1>Dutch government formation: open letter on Free Software and Public Money? Public Code!</h1>

  <p>The Dutch government is about to form itself and setting up goals for
the next term. With an open letter, the FSFE urges the coalition parties to
implement the "open, unless" policy of 2020 and thus the principle of
Public Money? Public Code!</p>


<p>
Free Software gives everybody the right to use, study, share, and improve
software. This right helps support other fundamental freedoms like
freedom of speech, press and privacy. With the principle of "Public Money?
Public Code!" implemented, the government will improve the transparency and
digital sovereignty.</p>

<p>
Also it will help educational institutions with
digital skills, information literacy, and improving the privacy of students
and staff. At the same time it will stimulate the IT market and thus others
like the labour market. Open code encourages cooperation with
governments at home and abroad.
</p>

<p>First attempts to promote Free Software among public bodies, like the
"open, unless" policy of 2020, need to be followed, implemented, and
extended. We urge for legislation requiring that publicly financed
software developed for the public sector be made publicly available
under a Free Software license. Code paid by the people should be
available to the people!</p>
