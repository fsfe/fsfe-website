<h1>"I Love Free Software Day" 2024: Forging the future with Free Software</h1>

<p>
Together with hundreds of people and several organisations, we have 
celebrated another "I Love Free Software Day" on 14 February! On this 
day, we reached out to Free Software contributors to say <q>Thank 
you!</q>. To all who joined us this time: <q>Thank you</q> for 
participating in this 14th edition of the "I Love Free Software Day" 
❤️❤️❤️!
</p>

<p>
The "I Love Free Software Day" 2024 focused on younger generations and 
how to introduce them to the Free Software community. Therefore, several 
of our local groups celebrated this day with a meeting focused on 
younger people. The rest just focused on the main "I Love Free Software 
Day" idea: to acknowledge the amazing Free Software community, thanking 
Free Software projects and sharing their love for Free Software. And 
while several FSFE local groups - in Italy, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, 
England, Germany, and Switzerland - got together and celebrated their love 
for software freedom in person, we were happy to see how other members of the Free 
Software community joined our call and organised meetings, like the one in Portugal.

<h3>I Love Free Software Day celebrations 2024</h3>

<p>
For this year the FSFE planned a special gift for several 
organisations and long-term volunteers to get them ready for 'I Love 
Free Software' day. We gave them an acrylglas heart and an LED strip, 
plus a microcontroller and some jump wires. The challenge? To tinker 
around with these things and to upload a picture of the heart on 14 
February. It turned out to be  <a 
href="https://rwright.co/i-love-free-software-day">quite a 
challenge</a>, but a lot of fun!

<h3>Local group celebrations 2024</h3>

<p>
For the celebrations in 2024, over a hundred people came together in seven different countries in <a 
href="/activities/ilovefs/">13 local meetings</a> organised either by FSFE local groups or by other Free Software groups. The celebrations were as different as the groups. The local 
group in Aarhus, Denmark, organised a reading of the children's book <a 
href="/activities/ada-zangemann/">"Ada &amp; Zangemann"</a>, while the 
Portuguese organisation <a 
href="https://esop.pt/destaque/esop-vai-participar-no-7o-debate-do-gt-pasc-democracia-cidadania-e-inclusao-social">esop 
organised a translation</a> of this book into Portuguese.

<p>
Dario Presutti, FSFE's Project Manager, welcomed around 50 guests, 
including some younger people, to celebrate "I Love Free Software Day" 
together. After everybody arrived, and the guests settled in, Dario and 
Kenobit had a deep and insightful discussion about Free Software and 
younger generations, with a special focus on how the fediverse could be 
a game changer in attracting more people to the world of software 
freedom. But not only did they  speak, but also guests where afterwards 
invited to thank their favourite Free Software project. The evening 
continued in a relaxed round with food and drinks.

<h3>Reaching out to the people behind Free Software: Thank you</h3>

<p>
Another "I Love Free Software Day" has passed and hundreds of people 
shared their appreciation for Free Software by reaching out to the 
people behind their favourite Free Software project. There where a lot 
of great ways to do so. While the <a 
href="https://mastodon.social/@fedora@fosstodon.org/111931755495550904">Fedora 
Project</a> shared their appreciation for a lot of Linux distribution, 
NLnet published their list of projects in a <a 
href="https://blog.nlnetlabs.nl/nlnet-labs-loves-packagers/">blog 
post</a>.
</p>

<blockquote><p>«It is amazing and inspiring to see how many FOSS projects and organisations come up with ideas for the "I Love Free Software Day". It is truly humbling to see how grateful the whole Free Software ecosystem is for the work all those contributors do for software freedom. Thank you so much for making this another amazing "I Love Free Software Day"» -Bonnie Mehring, coordinator of the "I Love Free Software Day"</p></blockquote>

<p>
And of course there were a lot of movement in the social networks and in 
the Internet! A lot of tweets and toots we published encouraging and 
thanking Free Software contributors. The Tor Project published an <a 
href="https://blog.torproject.org/i-love-free-software-day-interview-fsfe/">interview 
with the FSFE's President, Matthias Kirschner,</a> about the children's 
book Ada &amp; Zangemann. And the Swiss <a 
href="https://gnulinux.ch/ciw073-podcast">GNU/Linux.ch dedicated a 
podcast episode</a> to this year's "I Love Free Software Day". Also some 
news about the FSFE where published by TUXEDO Computers, <a 
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlkWTHx0bd4">who talked with 
Albert Dengg</a> about FSFE's activities. Albert, is a System 
Administrator of the FSFE and a member of the FSFE's  <a 
href="https://docs.fsfe.org/en/teams/system-hackers">System Hackers</a>.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the visible presence on Twitter (now X) and in the Fediverse, 
the FSFE said <strong>thank you</strong>, in a more old-school way, with 
some <a hef="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#ilovefs">postcards</a>. The 
postcards where sent to projects opn which the FSFE's infrastructure and 
daily workflow relays.

<p>
This is the second time the FSFE has sent out some postcards to Free 
Software projects. This activity was well received and it was awesome to 
see how much joy a thank you can spread. Several Free Software projects 
reached out to the FSFE by e-mail and shared their joy about the 
postcards.
</p>

<h3>Software Freedom Podcast episode with Karen Sandler and Alexander Sander</h3>

<h3>FSFE women's activity for the "I Love Free Software Day"</h3>

<p>
After their first involvement for the "I Love Free Software Day 2023", 
the FSFE's women group came together again and sent out some thank you 
messages to women in Tech. As women are still <a 
href="https://biancatrink.github.io/files/papers/TOSEM2021.pdf">under 
represented in FOSS</a> it is immensely valuable to highlight the 
important work done by <a

</p>
