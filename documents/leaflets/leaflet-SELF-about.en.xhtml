    <h1>About the SELF project</h1>

    <p class="background">
      Learning is at the heart of every society in the world. In order for
      humankind to evolve, we learn from the past, through imprints made upon
      us while growing up, knowledge passed onto us from our parents and the
      environment around us, or more recently, formal training through schools
      and universities. The SELF project, an acronym for Science, Education and
      Learning in Freedom, is a research project to produce educational
      materials on Free Software and Open Standards for use in such training.
    </p>

    <h2>The partners</h2>

    <p>
      The SELF project is formed by seven international partners and sponsored
      for a two year period by the European Commission. The partners of the
      project are Internet Society Netherlands (ISOC.NL), Universitat Oberta de
      Catalunya (UOC), Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), University of
      Gothenburg (UG), Internet Society Bulgaria (ISOC.BG), Fundación Vía Libre
      (FVL) and Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE), which are
      settled in Holland, Spain, Europe, Sweden, Bulgaria, Argentina and India,
      respectively.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The project goals</h2>

    <p>
      In its work, the project will create an online environment for the
      collaborative creation and sharing of educational materials, and will do
      so by creating the web platform necessary for this kind of collaboration,
      and demonstrate its use by collecting and putting educational materials
      on Free Software and Open Standards into use on the platform.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The platform</h2>

    <p>
      The platform itself will support common operations such as the merging of
      learning materials, reuse, adaptation, editing as well as collecting
      learning materials into forms useful for specific courses. It will also
      provide the necessary tools for the translation of materials into other
      languages, and the use of materials in many different forms, such as
      course texts, presentations, e-learning programmes, e-books, educational
      audio and video, manuals and reference materials.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The role of the FSFE</h2>

    <p>
      One seminal role of the FSFE inside the SELF project is to take care of
      all legal issues that may arise, as well as to form the Legal Expert
      Group to handle such regularly arising issues such as new licenses and
      legal maintainability of the platform. The legal work of the FSFE in the
      SELF project is done by our Freedom Task Force.
