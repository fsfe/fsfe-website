<h1>Request Business Cards</h1>

<blockquote class="r">
   "Business cards must answer the following quetions:
   <br />Who is this? 
   <br />Who is represented?
   <br />What is he/she doing there? 
   <br />How can I reach him/her?"
   <br />(Matthias Kirschner)
</blockquote>

<p>
The purpose of this form is to avoid unnecessary,
duplicate work. In the past, the process "production
of business cards" has often triggered a minimum of 10 emails
(but often enough far more) per person per set of
cards. The main problem was usually the lack of correct, complete data.</p>

<h2>Generally</h2>

<p>
Please write an
<a href="/internal/er.html">expense request</a> first.
</p>

<p>
In general, everyone on team@ is eligible for FSFE business cards.
If you are not on team@, or are unsure whether it makes sense for
you to order business cards, please contact
council@fsfeurope.org.
</p>

<p>
Before ordering business cards, please write an
<a href="/internal/er.html">expense request</a> first. Please wait for your expense request to be approved before filling in the form.
</p>


<h3>Language</h3>

<p>
English is default. If you need cards in another language
for good reasons, we have to produce two sets of cards.
Please use the form below twice in this case.
</p>

<h2>Contents of the card</h2>


<form action="/cgi-bin/businesscards.pl" method="post">
<table>
<tr>
<td>

<h3>1. First name and surname</h3>

We use the international form with all parts in lower cases with a
leading upper case for each word.  If there are very good reasons
to use another form, i.e. printing the surname in upper cases, as
it is common in France, this should be done in the localised
version of the cards, not in the international version.  <br
/>Data might include middle initials, but no nicknames (e.g. as
used in IRC).

</td>

<h3>2. Your title (or function)</h3>

A title/function should be mentioned. It might be generic,
somehow, i.e. "German Team".
<br />If you are an intern, please use "Assistant to the President" as your title.
You can leave the field empty as well.

<h3>4. Address</h3>

This should normally be an official FSFE address, either in Berlin or Düsseldorf. Other addresses should only be used in exceptional cases.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<h3>5. Tel. (optional)</h3>

When working at an FSFE office, the number of that office
should be mentioned. If not, it might be your own number
or left empty. If in doubt, ask the others.  The number
should be grouped by two or three digits, seperated by
spaces.

number, please use the same format as the phone number.

<h3>10. Fingerprint</h3>

The fingerprint of your GnuPG key. No, not the key ID, not
the kind of your key. The fingerprint will be printed in two lines.
<br />(You do not have a GnuPG key? Something went
terribly wrong.) You can generate this fingerprint with the following command in a terminal: 
[FIXME: fix formatting] $ gpg --fingerprint [yourKeyID]

will be printed on the reverse side automatically.

<h3>12. Amount of cards</h3>

500 is the default value. 500 cards will cost some 32 EUR.
Your <a href="/internal/er.html">expense request</a> is approved?
Everything less than 500 cards will cost almost the
same. If there are good reasons to produce another amount,
tell us here.

<h3>13. No of approved expense request</h3>

<h2>What happens now?</h2>

<h3>14. Preview</h3>

The printing company will send you a proof sheet as PDF, so you
can check whether your card looks ok and all the information on it
is correct. The printing company will not start the production
before you approve this PDF. 

We will send it to you and will
await your approval. We will use your fsfe.org address for
that purpose. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<h3>15. Delivery address</h3>

After your approval, we will send the cards to the address
which is printed on the cards, by default.
<br />If you want us to send them elsewhere, tell us the
other address, please.
</td>
<td>
<textarea cols="40" rows="5" name="delivery_address" ></textarea>

</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">
If <em>all</em> required data is <em>available and correct</em>,
and you are quick to approve it, you will receive your cards
within 5 to 10 days, depending on the snail mail systems. Our
all-time record is 24 hours. If problems occur (incomplete or
incorrect data etc.), the delay might turn out to be hellish.  Our
all-time record is 6 months.  <br />In most cases, office DUS
can't answer your questions regarding the data. In rare cases, we
can. When in doubt, please check with council@.
