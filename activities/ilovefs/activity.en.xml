    <description>
      We often underestimate the power of a simple <strong>Thank
      You</strong>. Free Software contributors do important work for
      our society and they deserve attention. The "I love Free Software
      Day" on 14 February (also known as Valentine's Day) is the
      perfect opportunity for you to express your special gratitude.
      Since 2010, we have celebrated this wonderful annual event with a
      ever-growing diverse community.
