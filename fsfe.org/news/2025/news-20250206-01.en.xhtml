<h1>German Elections 2025: We demand public code, secure funding for Free Software, and transparent measurement of progress!</h1>

<p>The next German government must finally push for the 
controllability, security, and sovereignty of the public digital 
infrastructure. As Free Software is a prerequisite for this, the FSFE 
is making 4 key demands: "Public Money? Public Code!", securing long-term 
funding for Free Software, deepening Free Software knowledge in 
administrations, and monitoring progress.</p>

<p>Public administrations and democratic institutions – as well as
society as a whole – require a reliable digital infrastructure. The
current dependence of this infrastructure on proprietary software poses
significant risks for Germany and Europe. Free Software, by contrast,
fosters collaboration and innovation, and strengthens Germany’s
technological sovereignty. Securing the ability to shape and control the
digital infrastructure of our democracy must be a central project of the
next German government. The consistent use of Free Software (also known
as Open Source) is essential to achieve this.</p>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) therefore calls on
Germany's next government to commit to Free Software for public
administrations, and to implement the following four measures:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Public Money? Public Code!</strong> Software developed with
public money for public administrations must be released under Free
Software licences. This principle, known as "Public Money? Public
Code!", must be enshrined in law and implemented by the new government.
This is the only way to free public administrations from their
dependency on proprietary software and its vendors, and to ensure
technological sovereignty.</li> 
<li><strong>Secure long-term funding for Free Software!</strong> Instead of investing billions in
proprietary licences and thereby cementing existing dependencies, the
federal government must ensure long-term funding for Free Software both
through public procurement and targeted support for core infrastructure.
The Centre for Digital Sovereignty (ZenDiS) plays a key role in the push
for Free Software in Germany. ZenDiS therefore needs a long-term, stable
budget to continue supporting administrations on their path to
technological sovereignty through Free Software.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen administrative skills and civil society
involvement!</strong> Many public administrations and civil society
organisations already have expertise in procuring and using Free
Software. The government needs to make these resources available across
the public sector. Existing expertise within Free Software communities
and civil society must be strategically integrated.</li>
<li><strong>Measure progress!</strong> Public administrations need to
collect and publish statistics on the procurement, use and distribution
of Free Software. These statistics will allow effective monitoring of
progress in increasing the share of Free Software in the public
sector.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the FSFE launched the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">"Public
Money? Public Code!" initiative</a>, democratic parties in the German
Bundestag have increasingly recognised that technological sovereignty
requires Free Software. "Public Money? Public Code!" is reflected in
party conference resolutions and election programmes. Although the
previous federal government failed to implement its promising coalition
agreement, a <a href="/news/podcast/episode-27.html">recent public
hearing in the Bundestag's Digital Committee</a> confirmed that the
goal of strengthening Germany's technological sovereignty through Free
Software is undisputed among the democratic parliamentary groups. It is
now the task of the next German government to finally address and
implement this goal and to ensure that our digital infrastructure
becomes controllable and future-proof.</p>
<h3 id="free-software-and-public-money-public-code"><span id="anchor"></span>Free Software and "Public Money? Public Code!"</h3>
<p>Free Software gives everyone the right to use, study, share, and
improve applications for any purpose. These four freedoms ensure that
similar applications do not have to be programmed from scratch every
time and, thanks to transparent processes, others do not have to
reinvent the wheel. In large projects, expertise and costs can be shared
and applications are available to all. This promotes innovation and
saves taxpayers money in the future. Dependencies on vendors are
minimised and security issues can be fixed more easily. The Free
Software Foundation Europe, together with over 200 organisations and
administrations, is therefore calling for “Public Money? Public Code!” -
If it is public money, it should be public code as well! More
information on the initiative is available on the "<a 
href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money? Public Code!"
website</a>.</p>
