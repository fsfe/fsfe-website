    <title>EUCD - Copyright extensions that harm</title>
    <description>
      The European Copyright Directive (EUCD) was the European equivalent of the 
      US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). These laws lead to the 
      creation of monopolies and cartels, and pose serious obstacles to freedom 
      of speech and the press by providing means for digital censorship. The 
      FSFE has been actively involved in opposing such harmful legislation.
