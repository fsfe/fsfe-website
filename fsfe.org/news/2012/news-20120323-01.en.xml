    <title>Article: Commandment for minimalistic formats - Being an Open Standard is not enough</title>

    <body>
      <p> 
      With <a href="http://documentfreedom.org">Document Freedom Day</a>
      coming up on Wednesday, we're publishing an article by FSFE co-founder
      Bernhard Reiter. He discusses what makes a good data format, and argues
      that Open Standards are good, but that we need to push further still. His
      central question to data formats is "Can we make it simpler?"
