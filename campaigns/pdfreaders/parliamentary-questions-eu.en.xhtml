    <p>Numerous EU public websites refer to proprietary software, like Acrobat
    Reader, as the only possible way of reading PDF files, and provide a
    download link. This is a case of direct advertising by public institutions,
    which creates a competitive advantage for one company to sell its
    products.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>Currently, on how many of the Commission’s own web pages do such
      advertisements appear?</li>

      <li>Could the Commission provide links to these pages, as well as names
      of EU institutions that have such advertising on their websites?</li>

      <li>What are the Commission’s reasons (e.g. financial gain, lack of other
      functional software, etc.) for advertising this particular software as
      the only possible way of reading PDF files?</li>

      <li>Have the institutions that have such advertising on their website
      explained whether they have tried other PDF readers before? Which
      software did they mention?</li>

      <li>What steps is the Commission taking to resolve this problem regarding
      a) the Commission’s own website, and b) the websites of public
      institutions in Member States?</li>
