    <h1>Open Standards</h1>

    <p align="center">[ overview | <a href="def">definition</a> ]</p>

    <p><em>
      Lock-in of data is one of the most common techniques to artificially
      raise the cost of migration to Free Software. Ensuring the best possible
      interoperability through Open Standards is essential in enabling users
      to escape vendor lock-in. FSFE's work on Open Standards has the goal of
      making sure that people do not have to lose all their data when
      migrating to Free Software.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>The relevance of Open Standards is closely linked to networking
    effects, and has consequently been rising dramatically. The reward
    for gaming the system for proprietary vendors is increasing, so is
    the cost for users of software.</p>

    <p>Governments, public interest NGOs, including groups that are
    concerned about freedom of competition or consumer rights are
    generally strong poponents of Open Standards. Typical critics are
    the proprietary software vendors and those that represent their
    interests. One of the items that critics seek to highlight is the
    inherent conflict between innovation and standardisation.</p>

    <p>Standardisation deliberately limits changes to a technological
    basis, including innovation. These limits are introduced in order
    to allow subsequent innovation by everyone that has access to the
    standard and not just the party that controls the technological
    basis. So standards limit the ability to innovate by a single
    party in order to allow innovation on the basis of that standard
    by multiple parties.</p>

    <p><a href="def">Open Standards</a> allow such innovation by all
    parties with no leverage for the initial developer of the platform
    to limit such innovation or the competition it represents.</p>

    <p>FSFE's goals include freedoms from lock-in, of innovation and
    competition for everyone. That is why FSFE is a strong supporter
    of <a href="def">Open Standards</a>.</p>
