        <title>'Modernising Public Infrastructure with Free Software' presentation in Caltanissetta, Italy</title>

    <body>
      <p>We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly available under a Free and Open Source Software licence. If it is public money, it should be public code as well.</p>
      <p>Francesco Bonnano, Software developer and FSFE volunteer from the local group Sicily; and Professor Michele Cal√† will present the 'Public Money? Public Code' campaign at 10:00 in Aula Magna (Auditorium) of I.I.S.S. Luigi Russo - 48/d Leone XIII Street. The presentation is in Italian, everyone can participate at no cost, and no registration is needed.</p>
