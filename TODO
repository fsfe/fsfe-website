TODO items for www.fsfeurope.org web pages (unsorted):

* Have a list of volunteers on /contribute/web, /contribute/translators, and
  /contribute/booth to give better credit to permanent volunteers. Should be
  done with name lists which are stored in a language indepenedent file and
  included dynamically with <dynamic-content>. At the same time, remove
  volunteers from /about/team to avoid confusion.

* Change dynamically built pages /about/team, /about/members and
  /about/legal/de/de to take language independent information about people from
  people.xml instead of person-*.xml. Remove language independent information
  from person-*.xml, these files should only contain the descriptions.

* Change all .xsl scripts to use <dynamic-content> instead of just appending
  the dynamic content to the end of the body.

* Make sure all non-dynamic *.xhtml files have a proper <timestamp> tag.

* Validate all HTML pages with validator.w3.org (is this scriptable?)

* Make sure all documents are linked from /documents/documents whenever this
  makes sense.

* Include a dynamic document list on the project pages using <dynamic-content>.
  This will make it easier to add a new document related to a project.

* Include a dynamic news and events list on the project pages for those
  projects where it makes sense.

* Check all pages for outdated content and update them to be current. This is
  certainly one for a rainy Sunday afternoon :-)

* Clean up .symlinks (actually they should be replaced by .htaccess redirects)

* Move files from /documents that actually belong to a project to their
  respective /projects/* directory (for example wiwo). Don't forget to add a
  redirect to not break old external links!

* Search the whole tree for broken links, external as well as internal (is this
  scriptable?)

* Create "braglist" (list of projects and documents) on personal pages (like
  /about/greve) dynamically from document and project .xml files. Requires
  adding an "author=" to documents and a "coordinator=" to projects.

* Scan the apache log for 404 errors resulting from external links and help
  avoid them by adding page redirects.

* Make the current page a non-link in the menu.

* Make a separate page per year for news and events.

* Find some smart solution for page groups that have a kind of local menu in
  [...] at the top of each page (like projects/swpat/* or projects/ftf/*)

* Find a better alternative for the focus system. Maybe just create different
  versions of these pages that are sensitive to focus (actually only news,
  events, projects, and documents lists)

* in internal/er.en.xhtml, allow for manual entry of name and email address
  additionally to the possibility to select from the dropdown.

* in internal/er.en.xhtml, allow for presetting of fields through URL, like
  http://www.fsfeurope.org/internal/er?budget=GENERAL

* Fix the 'non-valid' RSS. See http://validator.w3.org/feed/ for details.

* If there are seval related pages, I think the system should automatically
  generade a menu like the [ foo | bar | baz | frob ] line at the top of the page.
  (e.g. FTF, ThankGNUs, Software Patents, our SWPAT open letter campaign...)
 
* Create a table of content if there are more then 4 headlines on one page
  (like mediawiki does in its defaults)

* ONLY IF EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE: think about new TODO items ;-)
