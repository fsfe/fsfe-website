    <h1>Open Standards under threat in Europe</h1>
    <h2>EIFv2: Updated analysis available</h2>

    <p>
      The European Commission is currently trying to get a new draft
      of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) approved by
      Member States. The draft gives rise to concerns that the
      Commission is giving up its worldwide leadership in the use of
      Open Standards, hurting innovation, competition and user freedom
      in Europe. FSFE has updated
      its <a href="/freesoftware/standards/eifv2.en.html">analysis
      page</a>, comparing the current draft with previous versions, as
      well as demands from a proprietary lobby group. Ahead of
      <a href="http://documentfreedom.org">Document Freedom Day</a> on
      March 31, FSFE is in conversation with EC and Member State
      decision makers to make them aware of the problem.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Where the previous EIF included a relatively strong definition
      of Open Standards, the draft revision which FSFE has seen
      abandons the concept of Open Standards entirely. Free Software,
      previously a central concept, has been relegated to a single
      footnote.
