      <p>In  last year’s SFScon, the FSFE shared perspectives of the trends in Free Software legal and licensing that we’ve observed over the years while working with Free Software projects that were supported by the EU’s Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiatives.</p>
     <p>Since then, much has happened that has affected how all parties working within these NGI initiatives view software and tech development in relation to rapidly changing international norms.</p>
     <p>Gabriel Ku Wei Bin will speak about shifts in perspectives among Free Software developers within the NGI framework that the FSFE has observed in the past year, and the impacts these shifts have on the Free Software ecosystem.<br />
