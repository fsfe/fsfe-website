      <p>The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is currently being implemented and there are still some uncertainties regarding its impact on the Free Software landscape. In particular, the role of stewards is partially unclear. The talk will highlight the current state of the debate as well as ways and solutions on how to deal with the various Free Software stakeholders.<br />
In order to get closer to the questions, we have sent out a questionnaire to relevant stakeholders, the results of which we want to present. We also want to show ways in which the results can be incorporated into the CRA implementation process.</p>
