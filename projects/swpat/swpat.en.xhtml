    <center><h1>Software Patents in Europe</h1></center>
    <p>
      The European Patent Convention (published 1973) explicitly states that
      the field of <i>programs for computers</i>, i.e. software, is excluded
      from patentability.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is reason behind this: while a program in its concrete form is
      protected from plagiarism by copyright law, a patent would protect the
      mathematical and logical methods used by the program. Therefore, a
      patent would manifest a monopoly of specific calcuation methods, would
      make mathematical laws, logical rules and business processes the suable
      propriety of companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The United States of America have already traced out the path: Since
      software patents are legal there, it came to a flood of patent
      applications by big companies. They can easily come up with a suit for
      patent infrigment against any small or medium enterprise trying to get
      into the software market, and the unpleasant competitor is ruined due
      to the high process costs, or it is simply bought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, Europe highly profits from the burden the U.S. has put upon
      themselves: the small and medium software companies have made Europe a
      central player in innovation, while in the U.S., innovative software
      development is limited to a few monopolists.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the European Union faces a growing pressure from the outside
      to allow software patents like the U.S. does. On the one hand, the
      European Patent Office (which is not controlled by any government or
      the EU) has granted about 30,000 software patents <i>despite the fact
      they are disallowed by the European Patent Convention</i>, on the other
      hand, a directive on the "patentability of computer implemented
      inventions" is being prepared with the intent to legalise those
      (granted, but currently not legally valid) patents.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>

    <p>
      The European Commission's original proposal for the directive, which
      has been heavily criticised, would have allowed unlimited patenting of
      software, calcuation rules and business processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      September 24, 2003 the European Parliament (which is elected directly
      by the people in the EU) voted on the commission's proposal. The
      Members of the Parliament decided to pass a heavily modified version of
      the directive which would prevent patentability of pure abstract
      software without a technical context. This decision to value the needs
      of European economy higher than the wishes of the excessively lobbying
      global companies was widely regarded as a victory for democracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 18, 2004 the council of the European Union (which consists of the
      Ministers in charge of the member states) rejected the parliament's
      version and agreed upon a text that is basically the same as the
      original proposal of the commission, and in some respects even worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decision process in the European Union is very complex. Now it's
      again the parliament's turn to agree with the council or to present a
      counterproposal. The further steps will depend on whether the
      parliament is able to keep up it's non-acceptance of software patents.
    </p>

    <h2>The Most Important Items Of The Directive</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>General patentability of software:</b>
        While the version that the European Parliament agreed upon negates
        the general patentability of software and only allowes software
        patent in a very limited way for clearly defined exceptions, the
        council's version declares a general patentability of software and
        tries to calm down critics by fictitious restrictions that can be
        circumvented in praxis without problems.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Interoperability:</b>
        The European Parliament states in its version of the directive that
        data exchange or data conversion ("interoperability") can never
        constitute a patent infrigment. The council stroke out this
        rule and therefore allows patenting and monopolising file formats.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Definition of "technical":</b>
        The version of the parliament defines clearly that only technical
        inventions are patentable, and defines the word "technical" as
        "applying of nature forces". Opposed to that, the council did not
        only strike out the definition of "technical", it also decided that
        inventions should also be patentable if they show <i>no technical
        progress at all</i>!
      </li>
    </ul>
