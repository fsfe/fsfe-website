    <h2 id="about">About FSFE's Community</h2>
    
    
    
    <p>The community behind the Free Software Foundation Europe is diverse and spread throughout the continent. We see ourselves as Europeans with a different cultural background but with the common vision of an infrastructure built on Free Software - as a precondition of a Free Society. This is what makes us strong. We believe in cooperation from a regional to a global level, from community to an organisational level, from freedom to liberty. Interested? You are welcome to join our community!</p>
    
    <p>Read about the different ways, how to become part of our movement:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wherever you live, wherever you go: <a href="../contribute/spreadtheword.fi.html">help to spread our word</a> by ordering our promotion material and give it to everybody who is interested. Or put it in a place where people can grab it themselves. Viral marketing and spreading the word are important factors to let our movement grow.</li> 
      <li>You can become a <a href="../support/index.html">supporter of the FSFE</a> to show that you care about the political and societal aspects of Free Software. After signing, you will be kept up to date with our <a href="../news/newsletter.html">Newsletter</a> and, additionally, you will receive special information about our activities. Of course, you are free to join our discussions and activities.</li>
      <li>If you have interest to support our mission with your skills and expertise, then we are more than happy if you contribute to our work. There are <a href="../contribute/contribute.fi.html">various ways to help us voluntarily</a> - not just by hacking. For example, translations are really important for our cross-border communication and outreaching activities. And you do not need to be an interpreter for the translations - if you are a mother tongue speaker and you have a feeling for proper language, this is a good start.</li> 
      <li>Finally, you can become a <a href="about/fellowship.html">Fellow</a> - someone who is a sustainable member of the FSFE. As a Fellow you get access to our infrastructure for you own purpose and to use it for the communication with other Fellows. You can also join or set up local teams and find help to do so by the staff of FSFE. You can even present yourself as a candidate for a Fellowship representative and become part of the General Assembly of the FSFE.  Being a Fellow involves membership fees. These membership fees are financial contributions, that directly support our work and make sure that we remain independent of any particular donor. When you  <a href="/fellowship/join">join the Fellowship</a>, you can decide for yourself about the amount of your donation.</li>
    </ul>
