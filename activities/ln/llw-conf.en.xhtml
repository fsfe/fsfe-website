      <h3><strong>About the Legal and Licensing Workshop</strong></h3>

    <p> This event has become the world’s foremost
      gathering of lawyers, technologists, and thought leaders on Free
      Software legal and licensing topics. With up to three days of
      talks in an informal and confidential atmosphere, the Workshop
      advances the state of the art of knowledge on topics ranging from
      license compliance to patent management, from project governance
      to corporate responsibility and even further to the cutting edge
      issues themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participation in the LLW provides legal professionals not only
      the opportunity to share knowledge and updates on the topics they
      are working on, but also a chance to meet and get acquainted with
      each other. These two aspects, combined, foster better license
      compliance by spreading best practices. The conference also
      provides a forum for different professionals to better understand
      each other, thus reducing the overall friction in the sector.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participation in the LLW is open to all Legal Network members.
      Invitations might be extended to non-members. If you think you
      might qualify, please send an e-mail directly to the Legal

    <h3 id="info"><strong>Important information about Swedish Covid-19 Regulations</strong></h3>
    
    <p>The Swedish government has announced that from 29th September 2021 onwards, 
    Sweden is lifting all the restrictions that apply to restaurants, bars and 
    public events. Therefore, you can rest assured that the conference could take 
    place without any unnecessary hindrances. Moreover, Sweden is not introducing 
    a domestic vaccine pass, unlike other EU member states. However, unvaccinated 
    people are still advised to remain cautious about their movements. In any case, 
    it is always advisable to travel only upon being fully vaccinated. </p>
    
    <p>As regards travel is concerned, the non-EU/EEA entry ban in Sweden remains 
    in force until October 31st 2021. <strong>Sweden always applies travel restrictions 
    to the last country you have visited, even if this is only a transit country</strong>. 
    Currently, in order to travel into Sweden, foreign nationals travelling from 
    an EU/EEA country <strong>need to have an EU Covid certificate, a negative Covid-19 
    test no more than 72 hours old, or a certificate of recovery</strong>. The Covid 
    certificate shows that a person has been tested negative, has been vaccinated 
    against, or recovered from Covid-19. This will apply only until 31 October 
    2021 and we sincerely hope that the restrictions remain removed at the time 
    of the conference as well. </p>
    
    <p>We will share more updated information about Covid-19 regulation in Sweden, 
    as the date of the event gets closer.</p>
