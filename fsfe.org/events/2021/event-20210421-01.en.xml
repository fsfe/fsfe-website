        <title>FSFE Netherlands online get-together (online) in Online, Netherlands</title>

    <body>
      <p>On April 21st, the FSFE Netherlands will have another localgroup meeting. Like the last few times it will be held online, so that despite of missing our regular physical meeting we keep in touch. The meeting will be from 20:00 to 21:00 CEST on the conference server. It is usually quite 'gezellig' and so most stay until 22:30, but you can leave whenever you see fit. The meeting is open for everybody, and we'll switch to English if not everybody understands Dutch. To join the meeting please send an email to country coordinator Nico Rikken (nico[dot]rikken[at]fsfe[dot]org), he will send you the meeting link and access code.</p>
