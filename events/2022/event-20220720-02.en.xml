        <title>FSFE Women group meeting (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>FSFE Women is a group for women* who are interested in Free Software. We get together about once a month online to meet, give talks about topics we find interesting in the area of Free Software and discuss recent developments.</p>
      <p>Our upcoming online meeting takes place at 7.30pm CEST in our BBB room. This is going to be a casual evening again, so please bring your topics related to free software, news you like to share or ideas who to invite for guests for upcoming meetings. There is also the idea to create gimmicks with our logo, e.g. stickers but not only.</p>
