<h1>PDFreaders - Follow Up</h1>

 
<p>In November 2010, with <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders">the PDFreaders campaign</a>, FSFE has sent a <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/letter.html">letter</a> to all the public institutions on our <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/buglist.html">buglist</a> asking them either to remove their advertising for proprietary software or, at least, run concurrent advertising for Free Software, so that users of their websites realise they have a choice.</p>

<p>Some of the institutions already answered to our requests but many others have not answered yet. We spent time and money to send these letters, therefore, as Free Software activists and European citizens, we have a right to get an answer, whatever it would be.</p>

<p>Here is how you can get active and send some emails to the institutions of your country asking them to remove advertisements to non-free software from their websites.</p>

<h2>Always be kind</h2>

<p>Get angry will not get you anywhere. We sent a letter making a kind and motivated proposal. What we have to do now is to keep the same attitude and friendly ask the institutions to take our letter into consideration. It may happen that someone will respond you with a rude criticism: that is not important! Be always kind and take into account that our goal is to convince them to correct an obvious neutrality problem on their website. Don't answer to criticism not related to our goal.</p>

<h2>Find the right person to contact</h2>

<p>Take a bit of time to look at their website. If you find the <strong>webmaster email</strong>, that is certainly the best person to contact. If the website has been made by an external company, you will probably get nothing from them: it's not in their interests to let the public institution know that the site they have made has a problem of neutrality.</p>

<p>If you are not able to find the webmaster, you could look for a <strong>webform for contact</strong>. Be also aware that many public institutions have a <strong>Public Relations Office</strong> and that some of them should keep track of the emails they receive as for the standard letters.</p>

<p>If you are not able to find any of above mentioned contacts, you may write to the <strong>Major or to the Administration office</strong> of the institution. These people certainly have the greatest powers in the institutions, but keep in mind that they could be very busy and they would not directly modify the site. So, to get a reply from them can take much time.</p>

<h2>Find the right subject of your email</h2>

<p>People employed in public institutions receive dozens of emails every day (including spam). We don't want our mail is being discarded by mistake, so it is important to choose the right subject. A good subject could be: <strong>"Letter of FSFE from December 2010 on advertising for proprietary software on your website"</strong>.</p>

<h2>Write your email</h2>

<p>Write your email to remind them about the letter we have sent. If you want, you can use this model, but, please, remember to change the part inside the brace { }</p>

<strong><p>The letter and translations are available on <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/letter.html">FSFE's model letter page</a>.</p></strong>

<h2>What's happen then?</h2>

<p>After 15 days check again the website to see if something has changed.</p>

<p><strong>CASE 1: nothing has changed</strong>: Don't worry, even Rome wasn't built in a day. Write them again and recheck after 15 days. You could also try to write to a different email address.</p>

<p><strong>CASE 2: the bug has been removed</strong>: Check if there are other bug pages on their website. If it's so, write them again. If it's not, you have got success! Write an email to thank them for their efforts and also <a href="mailto:pdfreaders@lists.fsfe.org">write us</a> to report your success and to update the <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/buglist.html">buglist</a>.</p>

<p><strong>CASE 3: you received an email from the institution with some questions</strong>: Some institution didn't understand completely our letter. Reply to them, be always kind and try to make our proposal more clear. If you don't know what to answer, <a href="mailto:pdfreaders@lists.fsfe.org">contact us</a></p>

<p><strong>CASE 4: you received an email from the institution that told you that they have corrected the page but the page is still unchanged</strong>. Wait for few days then write them again.</p>

<h2>Final considerations</h2>

<p>To achieve good results with the PDFreaders campaign in your country is very easy. Many of the institutions before getting our letter had not even realized that they were advertising any software through their website and many of them will thank you to point it out. So, the hardest thing is to capture their attention. To do this, we need your patience and your determination. </p>
