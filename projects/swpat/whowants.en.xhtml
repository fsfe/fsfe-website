    <h2>Why would anyone want them?</h2>

    <p>Software patents were seen as a convenient tool by large companies in
        the United States to defend themselves against competition:</p>

    <p class="quote">"If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of
    today's ideas were invented and had taken out patents, the industry
    would be at a complete stand-still today. [...]  A future start-up
    with no patents of its own will be forced to pay whatever price the
    giants choose to impose. That price might be high: Established
    companies have an interest in excluding future competitors."
    <br />
    <div align="right">
        William H. Gates<br />
        Internal Microsoft Memo (1991)<br />
        [Fred Warshofsky, The Patent Wars (1994)]
    </div></p>

    <p>It should be understood that while the price of software patents is paid
        by all companies, big and small, the big ones can afford paying the
        price a little longer as they have deeper pockets. Also, they believe
        that it is worth the price to rid themselves of competition.</p>

    <p>Paying the price for the system, they obviously want their return on
        investment, which is why it is in particular the Business Software
        Alliance (BSA), a lobbying organisation for huge U.S. companies without
        European involvement, that has been pushing strongly for the adoption
        of software patents in Europe.</p>

    <p>Europe as a region is still gaining on the U.S. in terms of IT industry
        as it is free from the burden of software patents that the United
        States imposed on themselves.</p>

    <p>The small and medium software companies have made Europe a central
        player in innovation, while in the U.S., innovative software
        development is limited to a few monopolists.</p>

    <h2>The European Patent Office (EPO)</h2>

    <p>Another group that benefits from software patents are patent lawyers,
        because patent lawyers are needed to apply for a patent, to grant a
        patent and to contest a patent in court. From their perspective,
        software patents offer an area of almost unlimited patentability
        without the need for development or research.</p>

    <p>One of the places where patent lawyers are found is of course the
        European Patent Office (EPO), which has prepared the ground for the
        introduction of software patents by granting roughly 30,000 software
        patents -- acting clearly outside its mandate and disregarding the
        European Patent Convention from 1973. </p>

    <p>Since patent lawyers are also found in many ministries across Europe and
        not wanting to step on the toes of the EPO, several European
        politicians are now trying to legitimize these patents by declaring
        these to be "computer implemented inventions."</p>

    <p>That is why the directive in question is called the directive on
        "patentability of computer implemented inventions."</p>
