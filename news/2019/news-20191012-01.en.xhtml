<h1>Today is the Day Against DRM</h1>

<p>
  Join us and the Free Software Foundation in the fight against DRM!
  Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) is any technology that is built
  into an electronic product or service with the aim of limiting its
  use. It is designed to prevent customers from using digital
  technology in ways that do not correspond to the business agenda of a
  content provider or device manufacturer.

  <a href="/activities/drm/drm.html">Digital Restrictions
  Managements</a> often restricts individuals from doing things that
  are perfectly legal, so we might not be able to put together a mix of
  music files we bought legally, or to lend an e-book to a friend. Even
  backups can be restricted. Restrictions management technology removes
  basic rights and freedoms in the digital world. All DRM systems have
  one thing in common: They give businesses control over things that
  we, the owners, should be in control of. For example, businesses
  decide how often we can play the movies we paid for and what kind of
  files we can read on our e-book reader.

<p>
  Free Software is software that puts the user in control of their own
  devices. In contrast, DRM Digital Restrictions Management is
  technology to put the user under control of a third party: these two
  goals are fundamentally incompatible.
