    <title>SFP#12: Enforcement of the GNU GPL with Till Jaeger</title>
    <body>
      <p>
    With our 12th episode of the Software Freedom Podcast we dig into the
    history and the beginning of enforcing Free Software licences, especially
    the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). Together with Till Jaeger, who has
    been working alongside Harald Welte for enforcing the GNU GPL in the first
    court cases in Germany, we talk about the long way we have come since those
    early days.

    the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). Together with Till Jaeger, who has

    Our guest, Till Jaeger, discusses with our host, Matthias Kirschner, how the
    decision to go to court and stand up for the rights of copyleft licences
    came about. Till and Matthias tell an exciting story about those first steps
    on this new legal ground. They also highlight the short term and long term
    impacts of the first court decision in favour of Free Software. For example,
    how more and more information about licensing and especially using a Free
    Software licence became available and publicly known. But also how
    workshops, like the FSFE's yearly <a href="/activities/ln/llw.html">Legal
    and Licensing Workshop</a>, were created for those interested in using and
    being compliant to Free Software licences.
  </p>

  <p>Discover together with us the changes that have come from those first steps
    to the acceptance of Free Software in companies. Till has been involved with
    Free Software licensing for a long time and provides a deep and well rounded
    insight into the history of enforcing the GNU GPL. To give this episode a
    perfect ending, Matthias and Till also talk about some of the most common
    misunderstandings of Free Software licensing. This is the perfect episode
    for everyone to get an insight into one of the most important events in the
    history of enforcing Free Software licences.
