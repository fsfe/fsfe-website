<h1>SFP#31: Policy and EU: FOSDEM recap</h1>

<p>In our 31st episode of the Software Freedom Podcast, Alexander Sander and Bonnie Mehring discuss the highlights of the two Devrooms that the FSFE co-organized during FOSDEM 2025:
 the 'Legal and Policy Issues DevRoom' and the 'Funding the FOSS Ecosystem DevRoom'. Find out more about the topics discussed there and tips about what to re-watch.</p>

<p>FOSDEM is always a great experience and it is amazing to see how the hard work in organising talks, panels and discussions pays off. Once again the FSFE team, including Alex and Bonnie, 
had a fantastic time at what continues to be a place to be.</p> 

<p>The <a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/legal-and-policy/">Legal and Policy Issues DevRoom</a> focuses on current EU and US legislation, and this year with a strong focused on 
the implementation of the <a href="/news/2024/news-20240312-01.html">Cyber Resiliance Act</a>. This dedicated DevRoom provided the chance to discuss the worries and thoughts that are raised
in the community. It was amazing to see how the DevRoom turned once again into a networking space and provided a source of feedback loop to get in touch with the local Free Software communities 
and advocates.
</p>
<p>On the other hand the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/funding/">Funding the FOSS Ecosystem DevRoom</a> started a new network for all people involved in funding of FOSS projects 
to connect and share resources. This turn out is really inspiring and a great way to get new discussions started, to learn from each other and to share knowledge - just what Free Software is at is 
core a great community with four freedoms, to use, study, share and improve. ❤️</p>

<p>This is the perfect episode for everybody who missed FOSDEM or wants to keep the spirit of networking and staying in touch alive for a few more moments!</p>
