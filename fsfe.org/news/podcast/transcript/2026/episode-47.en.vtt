Dear listeners, thank you very much for listening to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:18.400 --> 00:22.600
The Software Freedom Podcast is brought to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:22.600 --> 00:26.800
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:27.120 --> 00:31.760
I'm Bonnie Merring and today we have a dedicated I Love Free Software Day episode.

00:33.040 --> 00:38.240
Each year on the 14th of February we celebrate all the contributors, developers,

00:38.240 --> 00:44.720
maintainers of free software projects. I would love if this would be a regular thing and

00:44.720 --> 00:50.000
if you would not need a dedicated date for it. But so far we have the I Love Free Software Day

00:50.000 --> 00:54.240
and on this day we say thank you so much for your contribution to Software Freedom.

00:54.640 --> 01:00.800
This year on the I Love Free Software Day we highlight the extremely important work

01:00.800 --> 01:06.720
done by countless of maintainers out there. And for this I'm very happy to talk with Lorenz's

01:06.720 --> 01:12.960
K, one of the maintainers from the monitoring platforms. Lorenz, thank you so much for making

01:12.960 --> 01:16.320
the time and thank you so much for joining me in the Software Freedom Podcast.

01:16.320 --> 01:20.480
Thanks for having me. Happy to be here.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.720
Hi you coming to the I Love Free Software Day celebration in Nürnbeck.

01:24.720 --> 01:28.640
I sure am. Yes. Already planted in.

01:29.840 --> 01:35.920
Very happy. Can you very very briefly summarize for me and our listeners what the monitoring

01:35.920 --> 01:46.320
plugins are? Okay briefly might be hard because I have to add some context. So there is a family

01:46.320 --> 01:54.080
of free software systems monitoring software. So the software which helps an administrator to

01:54.880 --> 01:59.680
monitor the actual computers which are in a company institution or whatever.

02:00.320 --> 02:08.400
And we started in 90s with Nagios and they had the idea of putting the actual monitoring.

02:08.400 --> 02:14.560
So the knowledge about how things work into separate little programs which are called

02:14.560 --> 02:20.960
monitoring plugins. So they were separate from the main program and this principle this interface

02:20.960 --> 02:28.320
was kept by forks and follow ups and the monitoring plugins project is a collection of those

02:28.320 --> 02:36.080
monitoring plugins which do the actual monitoring. This is I guess quite a far collection.

02:36.080 --> 02:42.080
So there are a lot of plugins probably in it. Yes I mean the specific programs that this

02:42.080 --> 02:49.600
collection are like maintained by the project itself and they have like 30 thing different plugins

02:49.600 --> 02:57.360
which more or less provide like a basic system functionality test mostly.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.880
All right how did you get involved with the monitoring plugins?

03:00.880 --> 03:08.000
Well I started a shop at a company which provides professional services.

03:08.880 --> 03:16.480
So I encountered the monitoring plugins there and of course at some point I discovered that back

03:16.480 --> 03:22.880
was something I didn't like and well as you do in the good free software world to be a good citizen

03:22.880 --> 03:29.760
you go there you complain in the issue tracker and then nothing happens then you start up with a

03:29.760 --> 03:34.720
pool request and then nothing happens and then you start annoying the maintainers about your pool

03:34.720 --> 03:39.600
request and then they say hey how about you become proud of the project and then you're in.

03:41.280 --> 03:48.560
That's basically it. So you got sucked in. Yes you know you start up with the one thing and then

03:48.560 --> 03:55.040
you already have the code open in the editor and think that that doesn't look good or maybe I would

03:55.040 --> 04:02.000
like to have that differently and you have a second pool request then and after a few of those

04:02.000 --> 04:10.000
somebody approaches you and says hey since you're already here do you want to be part of this?

04:11.040 --> 04:12.720
Do you also try to serve others?

04:14.560 --> 04:19.040
Not successfully. No it did not happen recently.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.960
Okay should I keep fingers crossed that you get more people?

04:22.960 --> 04:26.960
I mean why not? That would might help.

04:27.360 --> 04:37.600
Okay. How did you then like you found us back right and you were like proposing a fix to it

04:37.600 --> 04:44.000
and making sure that everything is updated but what keeps you motivated to continue with this?

04:44.000 --> 04:48.400
Like is there something that you say oh I find this very interesting and I should really

04:48.960 --> 04:57.360
keep doing that. That's I think there's not one easy answer to that.

04:58.160 --> 05:06.880
Partially it's just it's a little bit my project now and I have some strong opinions about

05:08.160 --> 05:14.320
things should work and how the code should look like. This is partially an aesthetic thing,

05:15.280 --> 05:22.400
partially a functionality thing so part of my motivation now is I want to have good things

05:22.400 --> 05:29.280
so things should be proper and well and well done. I mean if I'm correct with the

05:29.280 --> 05:37.440
how how to do it well is another metaphor discussion but now I am okay I've scrolled through

05:37.440 --> 05:43.760
the code and every time I think oh that doesn't look I want to change that and I want to make

05:44.160 --> 05:50.480
better I want to have good software in a way and that keeps me motivated.

05:51.440 --> 05:58.400
Partially it's also I mean this is software that works mostly well but if you have used it

05:58.400 --> 06:03.920
for time you think okay why are we doing this this way? Can we not make it better?

06:03.920 --> 06:12.240
So not only keep it up internally but also improve the functionality, improve the the interfaces

06:12.240 --> 06:20.800
and yeah so it's yeah basically it's I want to have good software in the end and I want to make

06:20.800 --> 06:29.600
good software and somehow this keeps me keeps me at a project still after years and after the

06:29.600 --> 06:35.440
that one bug I found. But is there also a human connection for you?

06:35.440 --> 06:42.960
All right that does not have to exist is it more about technical things that you want to fix?

06:44.080 --> 06:52.800
I mean there's some human connection inside the project but like all the the other people are not

06:53.760 --> 07:00.960
locally here so and we don't have that much communication in itself but of course I have

07:00.960 --> 07:09.120
communication downstream so I I feel now responsible for software which is actually in use

07:09.120 --> 07:17.360
heavily in use and is used by a lot of people so in a way I communicate the downstream if I make

07:18.640 --> 07:27.840
less than optimal error message then people the the action monitoring somewhere works bad because people

07:28.720 --> 07:36.960
can't think or can't recognize what I try to tell them and what what their server is not doing well.

07:38.080 --> 07:50.080
So in a way I'm trying to communicate to users but it's maybe yeah and this is everyone but this

07:50.080 --> 07:56.160
is important for you to keep going this kind of communication or because like with the users it's

07:56.160 --> 08:03.440
more like you communicate to them and I guess they sometimes communicate back to you if something

08:03.440 --> 08:10.560
doesn't work. Some definitely do and that's recently has been actually a very enjoyable

08:11.520 --> 08:19.280
communication and actually that's also yes something that's motivating if you have somebody say hey

08:19.280 --> 08:24.720
I'm a maintainer of a mainstream Linux distribution and this is not working for me

08:25.600 --> 08:34.720
and there's a okay let's debug this and maybe person comes up with a fix and says oh yeah cool

08:34.720 --> 08:41.200
you solved my problem and that's actually really really nice if somebody comes by and says oh cool

08:41.200 --> 08:48.000
that works for me you really you solved the problem I had and that's cool. I can imagine if it's

08:48.000 --> 08:53.680
a bit like you're describing what's behind free software when we talk about community because

08:53.680 --> 09:00.800
this is also this interaction with each other and this exchange of ideas and all and free software

09:01.360 --> 09:06.560
really really grows from those kind of interactions at least as my feeling.

09:08.000 --> 09:18.160
Yes it definitely makes this more fun a lot more fun and I probably wouldn't do it for me

09:19.120 --> 09:27.200
if it wouldn't be like that I mean let's say in a workplace you have if you have find a bug then

09:27.200 --> 09:32.240
you have to contact support and the support has to find a developer and then as you have

09:32.240 --> 09:38.720
play email ping pong for forever and in this project it's just so somebody opens a new issue

09:38.720 --> 09:44.240
there and says hey this is broken and they say okay how is about this and this oh it is a problem

09:44.320 --> 09:51.520
and now I fix it and now I have just in a very smooth and efficient way with

09:51.520 --> 10:00.240
with no hurdles in there helped another human and that's great. Is there something that you

10:00.240 --> 10:05.440
value a lot if there's some interaction you say oh this is how I prefer things because I guess

10:05.440 --> 10:10.480
there is sometimes interaction that is not so nice but I also guess that there's interaction

10:10.480 --> 10:19.680
that keeps you really motivated to be there. I'm lucky in a way that most interaction is actually

10:19.680 --> 10:27.120
at least okay so I could imagine if you have a front end project you get a lot of people who say

10:27.120 --> 10:37.600
that's the wrong blue yeah and at least but yes sometimes I have people I mean mostly people

10:37.600 --> 10:46.320
who opened up the issue previously who said oh great that that really helped and yes that's

10:46.320 --> 10:54.240
these are moments that I which I value. How many of you are in the maintenance group

10:54.960 --> 11:01.440
like how many of them are really active because I obviously checked out the gift page

11:02.000 --> 11:10.080
from monitoring plugins but I have mentioned on the site 153 I guess not 153 people are

11:10.080 --> 11:18.400
actively maintaining this project as far as I know. Not really I think we are about four people

11:18.400 --> 11:28.560
who are more or less active and also active in different parts I would say so in recent years

11:28.560 --> 11:35.600
I have done most of the work in the C part of the project I think we have one or two loose

11:36.720 --> 11:45.200
recurring individuals who also participate there then we have a package maintainer there

11:45.840 --> 11:55.120
which is great because he's like a link to a major Linux distribution and the bugs come to us

11:55.200 --> 12:00.560
and he also managed those those bugs and issues with in the project and then he puts the patches

12:00.560 --> 12:09.120
up so there's a very good good link to the actual user base so to speak and then other people

12:09.120 --> 12:18.160
for pro and for organization but it's very a very loose group I mean it's not like we we do a lot

12:18.160 --> 12:25.920
there so it's a low burning project so to speak but yeah that's I would call this dead core

12:25.920 --> 12:34.000
group in a way. You mentioned there's one from a Linux distribution that is part of this

12:34.960 --> 12:41.840
does now brought me to a to a thread or to a line of communication that I also want to touch

12:42.000 --> 12:49.920
upon is resources because for testing software and all of this kind you need resources to figure out

12:49.920 --> 12:54.640
if this actually works with this project if this also works with that project and you already

12:54.640 --> 13:00.240
mentioned monitoring plugins are widely used on various systems so it's not on a Linux based

13:00.240 --> 13:05.680
systems they are also open the ESD freebies they want ever I'm not mentioning them all but don't

13:06.400 --> 13:11.760
they're all they're all there and they're very important don't get it wrong that means you missed

13:11.760 --> 13:22.080
that one on my toaster which one so you know what I mean like there are quite a lot of systems

13:22.080 --> 13:31.200
operating systems out there all of them equally important but how do you test the software

13:31.200 --> 13:39.920
then running for this like where do the resources come from well effectively not to be quite

13:39.920 --> 13:46.960
honest we were we are testing at different things on a few different Linux distributions

13:48.480 --> 13:56.960
but effectively we are not testing on ourselves on other Unixes

13:57.920 --> 14:05.040
partially because that's a hassle to get it up on GitHub and partially because this

14:05.040 --> 14:12.720
yeah would require resources to set up the testing to create a testing setup in itself find out

14:12.720 --> 14:19.920
how can a compiler how can I introduce tests there and for end-to-end tests what is the appropriate

14:19.920 --> 14:31.440
software there and so this is just something the group and I did not prioritize until now so

14:31.440 --> 14:40.880
sadly we rely on we would say end user testing so I have recently especially we had some very good

14:40.880 --> 14:49.760
contributions from one of the BSDs where people said oh so I said okay we're doing a release candidate

14:49.760 --> 14:55.200
for for a new release and they said okay let's let's put this in testing on our distribution and

14:55.200 --> 15:03.840
see what falls out and they then played the the connection between this BSD and us and that was

15:03.840 --> 15:10.640
very cool but of course it's not ideal so to speak to test it in production but is there something

15:10.640 --> 15:17.520
that others can do and help you with like the people with the BSD did is this something that you

15:17.520 --> 15:22.880
as a group of wish for or is this something that would put more burden on you because then there are

15:22.880 --> 15:30.320
no more issues and people coming to communicate with you and all of that no I would actually appreciate

15:30.320 --> 15:39.280
that if people if there was a good way to sort of like putting up testing pipelines on different

15:39.280 --> 15:46.400
unixes but yeah somebody if somebody would like to do that work that'd be really great

15:49.200 --> 15:55.760
yeah but so far nobody turned up but that would actually be really helpful so if we can test

15:56.400 --> 16:03.360
more and better before we put it in a release then we can smooth out bugs earlier and

16:04.160 --> 16:11.840
also do would not endanger a running system out in the wild so that also would of course be

16:11.840 --> 16:18.480
better to to make good work it's just a thing yeah to to find the time and everything for that

16:18.480 --> 16:25.440
but if people would show up with that and say okay you you have something that improves the

16:25.440 --> 16:33.280
quality here then I would love that that's very nice is there something that you would say

16:33.280 --> 16:39.680
maintain us generally speaking now I know you cannot speak for everybody but from your perspective

16:39.680 --> 16:46.480
is something that people actually need I know it's a hard question yeah it's a hard question and

16:47.040 --> 16:57.920
of course that cannot be a single answer to that I mean that the classic is to say a real

16:57.920 --> 17:08.560
probably financial contribution I mean a lot of infrastructure around the world is free software

17:08.560 --> 17:14.960
I mean probably everybody knows that it's KZD comic certainly forgot the number

17:15.840 --> 17:28.320
I will link it in the show notes thank you so an actual recognition and a free software work

17:28.320 --> 17:38.880
on which role it plays in modern infrastructure would be great here I mean there's some

17:39.680 --> 17:47.280
lonely initiatives I would say let's say an L-net which is great but like why is there not like

17:48.400 --> 17:55.200
a a national software development company where say okay I'll just hire 500 people who do the

17:55.200 --> 18:01.120
open software work in this country and they'll just support them and get them some food

18:01.440 --> 18:12.000
because they're keeping this the infrastructure and that that would be good because yeah actually

18:12.000 --> 18:22.560
some of our infrastructure is based on I find the time on a weekend to fix a bug there so that's

18:23.440 --> 18:32.160
not the most reliable way to have infrastructure apart from that it gets recognition in itself would of

18:32.160 --> 18:40.960
course be good so to have people come to you and say yeah it's great I like that thank you

18:41.760 --> 18:48.480
occasionally that's pretty nice and I guess especially for library maintainers that does not

18:48.480 --> 18:55.760
happen often if you're if you're the maintainer of lip foo nobody comes up to you and says hey I

18:55.760 --> 19:02.240
last that I have that in 300 programs on my computer running currently that's great work you did

19:02.240 --> 19:09.360
there this is a short break for our own cause thank you for listening to the software freedom

19:09.360 --> 19:16.000
podcast working for software freedom and producing podcasts costs money please consider

19:16.400 --> 19:21.600
supporting us with a donation on the fsfe.org slash donate and then the show notes

19:24.400 --> 19:31.440
I mean it would be nice of course just as on a human basis yeah so to feel seen you mean yes

19:32.400 --> 19:40.080
and so a convoyage meant into receiving to have recognition for that work but I guess the the

19:40.080 --> 19:48.960
extra physical financial aspect should not be you should also be there absolutely I can absolutely

19:48.960 --> 19:56.800
agree on that but to get the world up is there a project that you really like and would like to say

19:56.800 --> 20:04.800
thank you to I thought about this for for long and then it should be because of course this is

20:05.520 --> 20:13.440
very tricky because it's such a huge number of of projects I actually just have on my computer

20:15.760 --> 20:23.520
so I thought what would be one that actually does not get noticed very often so and I thought

20:23.520 --> 20:31.520
about a npd the music player demon which is a program to just play music and organize a playlist

20:31.520 --> 20:39.520
and a music library and it has been working on my systems for 15 years and the only trouble I had

20:39.520 --> 20:45.120
when I tried to configure the funny things and that plays music for me and it's great

20:45.840 --> 20:53.360
oh that's very cute no thank you very much last but not least what can the community do to help you

20:54.240 --> 21:03.520
I guess monitoring plugins and maintaining the maintenance of monitoring plugins of course

21:04.800 --> 21:12.480
cold contributions are always welcome issues especially notices about how their things are

21:12.480 --> 21:22.560
breaking or ideas about the improvement are welcome and although both of those create more right

21:24.000 --> 21:31.120
so things that would help in general I mean of course if people want to contribute long time

21:31.120 --> 21:40.480
and engage the project itself that would be great but of course a difficult thing but apart from

21:40.560 --> 21:48.480
that I would welcome things like static analysis and like maybe coding guidelines something they can

21:48.480 --> 21:57.840
automate which like reduces error rates my C is probably not the best C seen anywhere but so if

21:57.840 --> 22:03.760
people can come up with something that says me oh no that blind is broken because you did something

22:03.760 --> 22:10.240
wrong there and we can automate that or if people can actually build more test pipelines and

22:10.640 --> 22:21.120
build more test cases or documentation which is on my to-do list but you know so all of those

22:21.120 --> 22:29.200
things would be welcome and valued and I would be happy if people would come by and at least say

22:29.200 --> 22:35.280
hello in the IFC chat will also be nice I'm a link to IFC chat and I show lots then I just

22:35.280 --> 22:40.160
keep thinking about the documentation part because you know we have this program in competition for

22:40.160 --> 22:46.160
teenagers you've actually for freedom and in it we have eight criteria for eventually for the

22:46.160 --> 22:52.080
sure to evaluate the projects that are submitted and one of this criteria is documentation

22:55.120 --> 23:02.480
that's very appropriate I think yeah I guess so too anyway thank you very much Lorenzce for

23:02.480 --> 23:08.880
the time thank you so much for doing this with me and giving me a glamp and glimpse or an inside

23:09.600 --> 23:15.200
to say this in a better way of how maintaining works and what acts actually needed there thank you

23:15.200 --> 23:22.320
very much thank you for having me this was the software freedom podcast if you like this episode

23:22.320 --> 23:28.400
please recommend it to your friends and rated they tune for more inspiring conversations that
