	  <title>NLUUG Autumn Conference and CELF Embedded Linux Conference Europe, Ede, Netherlands</title>
    <body>
		The FSFE will be attending the NLUUG Autumn Conference on Thursday 6th November. This year's theme is 'mobility'. Feel free to come to our booth and ask about Free Software!
	    Shane Coughlan, Freedom Task Force coordinator at FSFE, will also deliver talk entitled 'The strategic implementation of free software in business' at the CELF Embedded Linux Conference Europe 2008 at the same location on the following day, Friday 7th November. 

		The successful implementation of Free Software requires an understanding of the best policy and processes applicable to its context. Shane will discuss how FSFE's legal project and its European Legal Network have engaged with this issue by producing generic market knowledge for supply and purchasing contracts, work flow documents and deployment methodology.
		
		The location for both conferences is Hotel en Congrescentrum De Reehorst, Ede, Netherlands.
