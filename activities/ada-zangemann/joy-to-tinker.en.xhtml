  <h1 class="p-name">Arouse children's -- especially girls -- joy to tinker with technology</h1>

  <p>The FSFE has created the illustrated book "Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of
  Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream" under an Open Education
  License (like Wikipedia). This has enabled people around the world to use the
  materials to encourage children to tinker with hardware and software and
  encourage them to shape their own technology.</p>

  <h2>Readings in schools, libraries, cinemas, ...</h2>

  <p>Our volunteers, staff, and the author of the book have done many readings
  in different languages throughout the world. They have read the story of the
  famous inventor Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to
  experiment with hardware and software, and in the process realises how
  crucial it is for her and others to control technology. By reading the book
  to over 1000 children in the last months we got the experience that children
  and especially girls afterwards want to get into "inventing things" and
  programming.</p>

  <p>For the events we have collaborated with organisations that introduce
  children into programming, with an embassy to organise a reading for refugee
  children including gifting them books, and brining an ice cream machine to
  the reading so the children could enjoy different ice cream afterwards.</p>

  <h2>Accessibility - Translations and alternative versions</h2>

  </figure>

  <p>Our goal is to make the materials accessible for everyone. Thanks to
  donations, the FSFE has paid for translations of the book into Arabic and
  Ukrainian, the French Ministry of Educations has coordinated the French
  translation and publication, an automotive company commissioned a translation
  into Spanish, and volunteers have translated the book into Valencian, Danish,
  Hindi, Italian, and are working on additional translations. Thereby enabling
  people to access the story in their native language.</p>

  <p>Furthermore we are working with organisations and publishers on accessible
  ebook versions for people that read differently, due to disabilities like
  blindness or low vision and will make them available in those formats.</p>

  <h2>Wider distribution with video / audio version</h2>

  <p>To reach more children, we will create a simple video and audio version of
  the book produced by an experienced 2D animation studio, also published as an
  Open Educational Resource. Everyone will be able free to download and share
  the video, put it on their or the schools computers, ship it with other
  education material, embed it on company's and organisation's websites, or
  display the video at events.</p>

  <p>If you make a donation to the FSFE and want to be mentioned in the
  announcement of the videos, write us a short e-mail why you support the
  FSFE's work and we will thank you by name in the announcement. If you donate
  more than 480 Euros you will be mentioned in the credits.</p>
