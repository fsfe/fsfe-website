  <h2>About the book</h2>

  <blockquote><p>The famous inventor Zangemann lives in a huge villa high above the city.
  Adults and children alike love his inventions and are desperate to have them.
  But then something happens: when Zangemann wants to take another close-up
  look at his inventions during a walk through the city, a child hits him in
  the shin with the skateboard. That hurts! Enraged, the inventor makes a
  momentous decision... The clever girl Ada sees through what is going on.
  Together with her friends, she forges a plan. But will this plan work?</p>

  <p>This illustrated children's book tells the story of the famous inventor
  Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer.  Ada begins to experiment
  with hardware and software and in the process realises how crucial it is for
  her and others to control technology.</p>

  <p>A book that arouses children's interest in tinkering and encourages to
  shape technology.</p></blockquote>

  <p>The book is currently available in German and can be <a href="">ordered
  directly from the publisher O'reilly Germany</a> or with your preferred book

  <h2>How to learn coding?</h2>

  <p>There are many resources out which help young people to learn programming.
  Our community is gathering more information about that topic on our <a

  page</a> and we invite you to help us with amending and keeping this
  up-to-date.</p>

  <h2>Download paint templates</h2>

  <!-- Insert PDF templates to print and children can paint them out.  

  One with skateboard, one with the demonstration so that they can put in own words and sent it in. -->

  <h2>Gallery of Ada and Zangemann by children</h2>

  <p>We would love to publish pictures of paintings or other things that
  children created about the book. In case your child painted an own version of
  Ada or Zangemann, a modified skateboard, how they imagine software, or how
  computer who print ice cream could look like in future. Please send them to
