        <title>FSFE Bonn local group meeting in Germany</title>

    <body>
      <p>We are a group of friends of Free Software who meet once a month in Bonn to discuss about Free Software. The meetings take place every second monday of the month. This time the FSFE local group Bonn meets online on 9 January. </p>
      <p>We are discussing how to make large amounts of data (JSONs) searchable in a browser and how to integrate Free Software Text-To-Speech into a blog. The question of coding without a 'real' computer reveals a short look at Android IDEs for mobile app development. Are Kilux and Chemnitzer Linux Tage might be good opportunities to meet besides FrOScon? Free music instruments are also of interest to us, this time featuring an opentheremin. Next event is on February 13, either online or in-person.</p>
