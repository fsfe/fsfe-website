<h1>Key stakeholders debated the future of Router Freedom in Austria</h1>

<p>
Together with the Alliance of Telecommunication Terminal Equipment 
Manufacturers (VTKE), the FSFE organised the online event "The Future of

The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) and the <a href="https://vtke.eu/">Alliance of Telecommunication Terminal Equipment 
Manufacturers (VTKE)</a> organised an online session about the future of 
Router Freedom in Austria. In this session, key stakeholders had

The event occurred in the context of the <a href="/news/2021/news-20210506-01.html">introduction of the reform for 
telecommunications law in Austria</a>, where the national regulator RTR 
is tasked with the regulatory framework for defining the boundaries 
between the internet service providers' networks and home networks of 
end-users. In this process, the new rules have the potential to 
negatively affect end-users' freedom to choose and use private routers 
and modems. Depending on the regulatory position adopted, either ISPs 
will continue to be allowed to impose their own routers/modems on 
customers or internet users will be able to choose their preferred 
router/modem for broadband connection. The panelists, therefore, had the 
opportunity to point out why Router Freedom is fundamental not only for 
consumer rights but also for a functional and competitive router and 
modem market.

The journalist Barbara Steinbrenner moderated the panel and it
consisted of decision makers, industry representatives and civil
society stakeholders. The panelists were: Dr. Natalie Ségur-Cabanac,
Head of Regulatory and Data Protection Officer, Hutchison Drei Austria
GmbH; Mag. Christian Drobits, Parliament Member (SPÖ) and spokesperson
for Data Privacy and Consumer Protection; Kira Terstappen-Richter,
MSc, VTKE Coordinator and Max Mehl, FSFE Programme Manager. You can

<h3>The Router Freedom initiative</h3>

<p>
<a href="/activities/routers/routers.html">Router Freedom</a> is the 
right that consumers of any ISP have to be able to choose and use a 
private modem and router instead of equipment that the ISP provides. 
Since 2013, the Free Software Foundation Europe has been successfully 
engaged with Router Freedom, promoting end-users' freedom in many 
European countries. Join us and learn more about the several ways to <a href="/news/2021/news-20210330-01.html">get involved</a>. Please 
consider becoming a <fsfe-cd-donate-link>FSFE 
donor</fsfe-cd-donate-link>; you help make possible our long-term 
engagement and professional commitment in defending people's rights to 
control technology.
