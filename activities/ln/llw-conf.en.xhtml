    <div id="introduction"> 
<p>The Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop (also known as the
      LLW) is organized every year by the FSFE to allow legal experts
      to discuss legal issues and best practices surrounding Free
      Software licences.</p>

<h3><strong>Dates:</strong>  April and May 2022. (Exact dates to be confirmed) </h3>
<h3><strong>Location:</strong>  Online </h3>

 <p><strong>Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, we have made the decision to move the LLW2022 to being an online event again, as it was last year.</strong></p>
 
     <p>The CfP for LLW2022 is <a href="https://pretalx.com/llw2022/cfp">open</a> until 30th of January 2022 - More information including conference final schedule, etc. will be updated on this page in the coming weeks as organization gets under way.</p>
 
     <p>Participants in the 2022 edition of the Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop are also invited to attend <a href="https://foss-north.se/">FOSS North </a>(exact dates will be confirmed soon as well).</p>
    

      

    
        <h3 id="info"><strong>Important information about the change of the event format</strong></h3>
    
    <p>While the Conference has always been an important aspect of the FSFE’s work, 
    it cannot carry on as normal in 2022 with the COVID-19 pandemic. The most 
    important thing to the FSFE is the health and safety of all participants, 
    presenters, and staff. The differences in approaches taken between various 
    countries and employers also complicate the logistics of organizing a physical 
    event for such an international audience. With these factors in mind, the 
    FSFE has decided to focus on providing a virtual space for Legal Network 
    members that approximates as much as possible a similar forum as the Conference. </p>
    
    <p>To this end, we will organize a series of online talks and discussions 
    that will take place between April and May of 2022 as a remote replacement 
    of the Conference. We aim to put together such talks once per week. We hope 
    that these online sessions would take the place of a formal online conference, 
    as it allows Legal Network members the flexibility to space their participation 
    over a greater period of time, rather than having to commit to a full day or two. </p>
    
    
          
      <h3><strong>About the Legal and Licensing Workshop</strong></h3>

    <p> This event has become the world’s foremost
      gathering of lawyers, technologists, and thought leaders on Free
      Software legal and licensing topics. With up to three days of
      talks in an informal and confidential atmosphere, the Workshop
      advances the state of the art of knowledge on topics ranging from
      license compliance to patent management, from project governance
      to corporate responsibility and even further to the cutting edge
      issues themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participation in the LLW provides legal professionals not only
      the opportunity to share knowledge and updates on the topics they
      are working on, but also a chance to meet and get acquainted with
      each other. These two aspects, combined, foster better license
      compliance by spreading best practices. The conference also
      provides a forum for different professionals to better understand
      each other, thus reducing the overall friction in the sector.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participation in the LLW is open to all Legal Network members.
      Invitations might be extended to non-members. If you think you
      might qualify, please send an e-mail directly to the Legal
      Coordinator, or to <a href="/contact/">our contact address</a>.
