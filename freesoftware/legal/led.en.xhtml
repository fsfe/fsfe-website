    <p> 

    Free Software grants users and developers the essential freedoms to construct a
    healthy and open digital ecosystem. To preserve and guarantee the continued 
    enjoyment of those freedoms, it is important to understand and comply with the 
    legal framework which safeguards our software projects from potential legal
    threats and also makes sure they reach their full potential.

    Understanding the legal matters and complying with legal obligations can become 
    a burden sometimes. That is the reason why we are happy to be organizing the
    first Legal Education Day (LED). It aims to spread basic legal education on 
    the legal context of Free Software, so that licensing your project, 
    understanding copyright, and meeting legal obligations in your software project 
    will be less of a daunting task! </p>

    <p> 
    We will explain basic legal concepts such as license, copyright law, and 
    its practical application into your projects with our 
    <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> initiative. Trademarks, Patents, 
    and Containers are more advanced parts of our agenda. You can check the 
    whole agenda <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/legal/LED/FSFE%20Legal%20Edu%20Day%202021%20-%20Agenda.pdf">here.</a> 
    </p>

    <p> This webinar is open for all to attend free of charge. You can <a href="https://registration.fsfe.org/LED2021">register</a> your participation , so we can get a 
    good idea of how many people will attend.</p>
