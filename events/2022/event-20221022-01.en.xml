        <title>Upcycling Android Workshop at FifFKon in Berlin, Germany</title>

    <body>
      <p>Every year, 1.5 billion smartphones are manufactured worldwide and thrown away after often a too short lifespan. If we continue to use our current phone instead of buying a new one, we help to avoid the increase of electronic waste. And if only every third person would use their phone 1 year longer we could save the raw materials for the production of 100's of millions of phones per year. </p>
      <p>This workshop brings together tech enthusiasts and sustainability enthusiasts to learn how to make phones last longer by flashing them with Free Software operating systems. There will be a short introduction talk on the relationship between hardware and software lifespans, followed by a flashing session of a sample phone. At the end and during the workshop we will answer questions about flashing and there will be the possibility to explore sample phones. The workshop takes place in the context of the FifFKon, on Saturday 22.10.22 from 15:00 - 16:00 hours in the Archenhold-Sternenwarte in Berlin.<br />
