	<p><img src="./pics/europe-at-night-250px.jpg" align="right" /><em>Imagine a European Union that builds its IT infrastructure on Free Software. Imagine European Member States that exchange information in Open Standards and share their software. Imagine municipalities and city councils that benefit from decentralized and collaborative software under free licenses. Imagine no European is any longer forced to use non-Free Software.</em></p>

	<p>This is what we are seeking. And although this vision feels like a long road to go, we know that we are taking major steps along it today. To help unlock our full potential on this road, FSFE offers cross-border collaboration and in 2016 its first European summit. Join us and our movement.</p>

	
     <h1>The idea</h1>
     
      <p>The FSFE summit is the main event to bring together FSFE members and supporters from all over Europe. We will offer rooms and slots during the days for our community to bring in their ideas and interests. Basically, this can be anything that you think is in interest to our community: From your local group activity and your experiences with that to a meta discussion of organising collective action to a powerful software tool that could be helpful for our means. We already had a <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/Summit2016/CallForParticipation">Call for Participation</a>, but we will keep reaching out to find the most promising topics and sessions for you. Or, if you missed the call but like to give input to our community, please <a href="mailto:summit2016@fsfe.org">get in contact</a>.<em>(this is for community sessions only, sorry but no more external speakers or topics possible)</em></p>
      
      <p>This is an event for the FSFE community, yes. And we believe that our community is not defined by membership. More than that, the FSFE is a European association whose idea is to represent and channel all European Free Software communities towards politics and to strengthen the use of Free Software throughout Europe, without borders. That is why during the FSFE summit there will also be a session in that we invite national Free Software organisations to represent themselves, their work and their goals. Together we are strong and we can make the difference. If you like to represent your organisation, please <a href="mailto:summit2016@fsfe.org">let us know</a> so we can plan accordingly.</p>
      
      <p>All community sessions will be embedded in an environment of talks and presentations by external speakers and professionals during the whole time. Expect inspiring inputs in and out our diverse community with a mix between prominent speakers and newcomers, both from various countries over Europe. The talks will be non-technical and address topics surrounding Free Software and it growth. Each summit day, there will be another theme.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>On Friday, September 2nd, talks will be dedicated to business with or around Free Software.</li> 
	  <li>On Saturday, September 3rd, talks will cover various aspects of Free Software policies and lobbying as well as community building. Also, there will be our 15 years of FSFE celebration in the evening.</li> 
	  <li>On Sunday, September 4th, we like to go one step ahead and offer talks and input about universal access beyond code.</li> 
	</ul>
	
      
      
     <h1>The setting and the venue</h1>
      
      <p>The first FSFE summit will be organised as a subconference of the <a href="http://qtcon.org/">QtCon16</a> that takes place in the <a href="http://www.bcc-berlin.de/en">Berlin Congress Center (BCC)</a>. This is thanks to Qt and Kdab who are inviting us to join their conference with our very own subconference. Although this comes with some mutual limitations, it comes with much more organisational benefits and synergy effects so we are more than happy for this opportunity. After all, it gives us the freedom to invest more of our energy into the actual content for the first FSFE summit instead of into the logistics.</p>
	
      <p>Also, this will be a benefit for our participants, as we are not the only ones that have been invited to share the QtCon. For three days the QtCon will bring together the subconferences of VLC, KDE, KDAB, Qt and FSFE under the same roof. Although this brings some complex logistics with it, be assured that we do our best to let everything run as smooth as we would like to experience it ourselves. One key element for this will be that you can switch between all of these subconferences and their talks - taking somehow part in all of them.</p>
      
      
     <h1>Attendance, community and volunteers</h1>
      
      <p>Because <a href="blogpost">we decided to join the QtCon as a subconference</a> we are urged to cover the costs for the location. Also, there will be catering during the day, including Lunch and Coffee break, both for free. Nevertheless it was important for us to offer cost-free attendance to our community members. This leads us into the situation in that <a href="blogpost">entrance is possible for free, but we ask you to consider donating</a>. In any case, when you register and you are a Fellow of the FSFE, please mark that you are member of our community. This will give you the availability to lower down your donation until zero or any amount you feel comfortable.</p>
      
      <p>As every community based conference, we are in need of volunteers. While the general "hands on" part is covered by the staff of the BCC (cleaning, setting up etc) we like to offer high class volunteering, means moderation, film-team, entrance check etc.</p>
      
      <p>We have a <a href="https://qtcon.org/attendee-policy">Code of Conduct for our conference</a> and we have a "SWAT-team" to ensure a save and peaceful environment for all participants</p>
	
	
     <h1>The conference program</h1>

      <p>You find the full conference program with detailed description at <a href="https://conf.qtcon.org/en/qtcon/public/schedule">qtcon.org</a>. In the following, instead, you find a broad overview to get it at a glance. Be aware, that these are just our external speakers. We will update with our community program as soon as we see the schedule fit.</p>
