    <title>EU antitrust case over: Samba receives interoperability information</title>
    <body>
      One case is over and interoperability won. The European Court made
      clear that interoperability information should not be kept secret and
      the agreement shows that Microsoft saw no way to continue its
      obstruction of interoperability in this area. This establishes a
      standard which everyone will have to meet from now on.
