      <p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is hosting a symposium on <a href="https://publiccode.eu">â€˜Public Money? Public Code'</a> in the practical work of public administrations. One focus will be on the use of Free Software in municipalities: What can best practices look like, and where are local administrations already leading the way today? What opportunities for collaboration are opened up by Free Software? What challenges arise when it comes to Free Software procurement? What opportunities does the use of Free Software bring for public administrations?</p>
     <p>We would like to discuss these and other questions together with representatives from politics, public administration, business, science and civil society as well as interested individuals The symposium will be held in German. An invitation with information on registration will follow.</p>
