        Why should I upcycle my phone?
      </p>

  <p>
	  Do you find yourself changing your smartphone device too often? 
	  It is not you, it is often the software of the device that makes 
	  it unusable in a short time. Instead of buying a new device, 
	  reclaim your smartphone by choosing Free Software. Save yourself 
	  some money and protect the environment. Upcycle your Android.
  </p>

<h2>The current situation</h2>

  <p>
	We need to deal with technology in a sustainable way. Let's start 
	with one of the most vital piece of technology in our daily life: 
	the smartphone. How does our current behaviour with smartphones 
	affect the environment? 
  </p>

    <div>
      <h3>1. We replace our smartphones too often.</h3>
      <p>
        Smartphones are too valuable devices, to be replaced every other year or less.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Tons of discarded phones damage the environment.</h3>
      <p>
		E-waste increases every year. In 2019 alone over 50 million 
		tons of electronic waste have globally been disposed. Recycling 
		is scarce, and most of the scrap ends up in the countries of 
		the global south.

      <h3>3. Producing smartphones requires a lot of energy.</h3>
      <p>
		It takes a lot of energy to produce smartphones. In fact, 
		producing the device takes as much energy as using your phone 
		for four years. This means that when you buy a new phone, 
		considerable environmental damage has already happened to 
		produce it. And the sooner we waste a device, the more we need 
		to produce.

  <h2>The silver lining</h2>
  
  <p>
    The current situation can be drastically improved.
  </p>

    <div>
      <h3>1. Even when the software lags, hardware remains in good condition. </h3>
      <p>
		You may decide to change your device for many reasons. The 
		device becomes slow or non-responsive, or the manufacturing 
		company stops supporting its software, which leads to security 
		risks. In most of these cases the <a 
		href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/about.html#problem-short-life-time-through-software-obsolescence">hardware 
		still works pretty well.</a>. So why tossing away your shiny 
		expensive hardware? Wouldn&#39;t it be better instead to update 
		and keep using it? That is what upcycling is about!

      <h3>2. The software can be replaced.</h3>
      <p>
		Smartphones can be modified. An operating system is a 
		collection of software that enables you to use your phone and 
		run applications on it. You do not need to stick to the default 
		operating system. Instead, you can install an alternative <a 
		href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/Android/OperatingSystems">operating 
		system</a> on your phone. For some devices, this process is 
		simple.

    <div>
      <h3>3. A device can become faster if it runs Free Software.</h3>
      <p>
		How many apps were already on your phone the first time you 
		turned it on? How many of them are you actually using? How many 
		of them run advertisements you are not interested in? Could you 
		uninstall unwanted apps? Pre-installed software often exhausts 
		the battery and processing power of your device. Switch to Free 
		Software and take back control of your apps. Only install the 
		apps you like and you will see your phone operating better than 
		before.

      <figcaption>The graphic shows the a cycle of software support as to be expected: when customers buy a smartphone with Android version x pre-installed, it should be common practice that whenever the next version (x + 1) of said operating system comes out, manufacturers offer an update to the previous version on their phones. This practice helps to keep users safe and to keep using their devices over a long period. </figcaption>

      <figcaption>The graphic shows an unfortunately common practice in that the initial manufacturer does not deliver any next version of the operating system as an update on a phone once sold. Instead, the manufacturer often stops further support and users are left with the already mentioned problem of outdated software and potential security problems.</figcaption>
