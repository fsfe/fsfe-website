<h1>20 Years FSFE: Interview with Nico Rikken on country teams' activities</h1>

  <p>
	In our fifth birthday publication we are interviewing Nico Rikken, 
	and we focus on the FSFE Netherlands country team. Through our 
	discussion you can also get a glimpse of how FSFE country teams 
	work. And if there is no FSFE team in your country, this is a great 
	opportunity for you to see how one forms.
  </p>

  <p>
	Nico Rikken, an electrical engineer and programmer, is one of the 
	Coordinators of the <a 
	href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/BNL">FSFE Netherlands country team</a>. 
	His interest in technology, combined with his 
	appreciation for community and disdain for central control, led him 
	to the FSFE in 2014. Since then, he has helped the FSFE with his 
	technical skills while contributing greatly to community building. 
	With this interview, you do not only get to meet Nico Rikken, but 
	also the FSFE Netherlands country team.

    <strong> FSFE: Do you remember the first contact you had with the 
    FSFE? How did it evolve from there? </strong>
  </p>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    <strong>Nico Rikken:</strong> I do remember most of my 
    &#39;firsts&#39; I had with the FSFE. Strictly my first contact was 
    reading the FSFE website and becoming a Fellow (the construct at 
    that time). But after this quite formal arrangement I was looking 
    for more informal contact and a feeling of community. So I still 
    have good memories how Felix Stegerman, then Deputy Coordinator 
    Netherlands, invited me to the <a 
    href="https://linuxnijmegen.nl/">Linux Nijmegen</a> User Group to 
    get to know each other and learn more about the FSFE. Up until that 
    evening my efforts in Free Software were a solo effort and that 
    changed in that evening. I became part of a larger community of 
    like-minded people, thanks to Felix.

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Later that year I attended my first Free Software conference, <a 
    href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/flx/tag/t-dose/">T-Dose,</a> and a few 
    months later my first FOSDEM. From there my FSFE journey evolved 
    with events, booths, presentations, community events, political 
    efforts, and meeting ever more community members along the way. In 
    2019, André and I took over Coordinatorship from Maurice Verheesen 
    and Felix with the goal to give a new impulse to the local group. 
    We have a growing group of active supporters with multiple ongoing 
    activities, which I feel proud to be a part of.

  <p>
    <strong>Together with André Ockers you coordinate the <a 
    href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/BNL">FSFE&#39;s country 
    team in the Netherlands</a>. Can you describe to us a typical month 
    in terms of activities and engagement within the 
    community?</strong>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Since the pandemic, the monthly online get-together has become the 
    heartbeat of the Netherlands country team. The lack of travel has 
    enabled us to meet more frequently and have a great attendance. 
    Before we would meet in the center of the Netherlands at the NLLGG 
    Linux User Group, but that required travel and so the turnout was 
    quite low. During our online get-togethers, we discuss a variety of 
    topics, from recent news and personal findings, to more strategic 
    opportunities to present the topic of Free Software, and ongoing 
    efforts. André and I facilitate by acting as a bridge to the rest 
    of the FSFE and to other organizations.

<div class="question">
  <p>
    <strong>In the last months we have seen <a 
    href="/news/nl/nl-202106.html">rising demands 
    for digital autonomy in the Netherlands</a> followed by <a 
    href="/news/2021/news-20210805-01.html">positive 
    developments regarding Router Freedom</a>. How do you see these 
    developments? What was the role of the FSFE Netherlands 
    country team?</strong>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I'm very concerned about the lack of Free Software and Open 
    Hardware adoption in the Netherlands, and the whole of Europe and 
    the world for that matter. Increasingly we rely on computer systems 
    rather than humans. This automation does bring a lot of benefits, 
    but also comes with risks of losing transparency, losing privacy, and 
    centralizing control. With the wide-scale adoption of cloud 
    services, AI, and algorithms and an increase in cyber attacks, more 
    and more people become aware of the need for better solutions and 
    more regulation. I see Free Software, Open Standards, and Open 
    Hardware as ways to improve technology itself and the social 
    structures around it, and so I think we need more of them and they
    need to be prioritized by our governments.

  </blockquote>


  <p>
    The issue of the Netherlands (citizens, companies, and government) 
    becoming too reliant on specific vendors and solutions is not new 
    and has been discussed many times over the last years. In that sense, 
    this <a 
    href="/news/2021/news-20210521-01.html">report 
    by the Dutch Cyber Security Council</a> was just another call for 
    change. As this report comes from an organization closer to 
    government and the call has urgency to it, hopefully we will see 
    some more action from companies and government. When called upon to 
    vote, Dutch PM&#39;s generally are in favor of adopting Open 
    Standards and Free Software, but in practice it is low on the 
    priority list and so the government is not held accountable to 
    follow up. The role of the country team in this 
    respect is limited. Rijk Ravestein wrote an article reviewing the 
    report and suggesting the adoption of Free Software as a viable 
    solution to this issue. Outside of the article, we have been 
    speaking with various government bodies on the topic of Free 
    Software to highlight opportunities and discuss ways to improve the 
    situation. I find it important that we not only follow the 
    developments critically but that we also constructively engage in 
    discussions where we can.
  </p>

  <p>
   The topic of router freedom is quite different. The Router Freedom 
   campaign has made our members take a closer look at the situation in 
   the Netherlands. This included André writing Internet Service 
   Providers (ISP&#39;s) about their practices and Kevin Keijzer 
   informing us how router freedom works out for him in practice. Kevin 
   has some of his findings documented on his <a 
   href="https://wiki.quietlife.nl/doku.php">wiki page</a>. Router 
   Freedom in the Netherlands in practice wasn&#39;t too bad, but 
   there are now stronger guarantees in 
   place. I think the practical freedom that was already in place stems 
   from the tech-savvy community in the Netherlands that would already 
   install their own router rather than the one provided by the ISP. 
   These new more formal guarantees can be attributed to the lobbying 
   of the FSFE in Europe and not to the country team in the 
   Netherlands. The FSFE contributed to the BEREC Guidelines on the 
   Implementation of the Open Internet Regulation, which were quoted as 
   the reason for the new rules. In the Netherlands, we missed the 
   opportunity of the consultation on the new rules 
   as this was not on our news radar. The consultation was 
   mostly by ISP&#39;s opposing the new rules, but regardless the rules 
   were put in place in accordance with the BEREC Guidelines.

<div class="question">
  <p>
   <strong>
     What do you see as the most rewarding activities or biggest 
     achievements of the Dutch team? 
   </strong>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    This question is difficult to answer because our activities have 
    been diverse and some have been in collaboration with people 
    outside of the country team. I think our biggest achievement has 
    been the level of translation of the FSFE website and marketing 
    material. André has been a persistent translator and together with 
    other valued contributions from other community members we now have 
    most of the information material and news in Dutch for an increased 
    reach and impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think our biggest impact came from our involvement with the 
    recent court case by Jos van den Oever about getting the source 
    code of the <a 
    href="/news/2021/news-20210611-01.html">Debat 
    Direct App</a>. This was not strictly a country team effort, but we 
    were involved and also got support from the FSFE. The final verdict 
    didn&#39;t result in public source code, but through the court case 
    Jos showed that source code can be requested via a Freedom Of 
    Information (FOI) request. The success will depend on the specific 
    situation and country-specific implementation of the EU directive. 
    Inspired by this request, Daniel Joffe has also filed a request for 
    source code and I&#39;m pretty sure this will not be the last legal 
    request for source code in the Netherlands.

<div class="question">
  <p>
    <strong>
      What would you say are peculiar factors that challenge or 
      facilitate the advance of Free Software in the Netherlands?
    </strong>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>        
    Please take my answer with a pinch of salt, as this comes down to 
    personal convictions and generalizations. I think for a start the 
    broader tech-savvy community in the Netherlands is helpful. There 
    are plenty of system administrators and programmers who value 
    control over technology from a do-it-yourself perspective and so 
    have an inherent preference for Free Software, Open Standards, and 
    solutions that protect user privacy. This group follows 
    developments or regulation and company offerings with a critical 
    eye on forums like <a href="https://tweakers.net/">Tweakers</a> or 
    technology podcasts which helps move forward the discussion on 
    these FSFE-related topics. There is also a smaller but active group 
    that shares our concerns from an ethical non-technical perspective 
    by questioning our reliance on big tech and the privacy violations 
    that typically go along with it. Both groups move the debate of 
    user control and digital sovereignty forward and nudge politics, 
    government, and companies in the right direction.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    I think this critical view on technology is strengthened on the 
    level of the European Union where these countries align and do 
    favor a more strategic play for which Free Software makes a lot of 
    sense.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Possibly our biggest factor is our participation in the European 
    Union, as it seems to me that the European Union has more capacity 
    to develop policies to protect civil rights and regulate digital 
    infrastructure. On a national level this topic doesn't win deciding 
    votes in the election, so it is hardly discussed in public. Also 
    there is a general lack of knowledge about technology and its 
    social constructs in parliament to question current policy and 
    develop a new one. I get the impression that a large part of the IT 
    solutions in the Netherlands are centered around US vendors. And so 
    regulations that prevent companies storing private information in 
    the USA are considered a burden on companies, rather than a good 
    safeguard for the general public. My impression is that it is more 
    common in France and Germany to question offerings by US vendors 
    and to prefer national offerings. These regulations do not directly 
    relate to the adoption of Free Software, but I do think that 
    questioning the ethics of offerings and valuing digital sovereignty 
    are the moral grounds which fit well with Free Software. I think 
    this critical view on technology is strengthened on the level of 
    the European Union where these countries align and do favor a more 
    strategic play for which Free Software makes a lot of sense. In 
    that sense I think the European Union is also advancing Free 
    Software in the Netherlands.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p>
    <strong>
      How can people start participating in the Dutch team? Can you 
      share some examples of how the existing members found out about 
      the FSFE Netherlands country team?
    </strong>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    The easiest is to join the conversation on XMPP or our online 
    get-togethers and align with our efforts there. We do have a mailing list 
    but in practice it is only used for announcements. As we are all 
    volunteers, I think it is important that our supporters do what they 
    enjoy doing. Most of us have our own topics and efforts we work on, 
    and the country team is a way to align and get support. As with 
    any work, formulating concrete steps and delegating work to others 
    can be a challenge. So I think there is an opportunity for more 
    collaboration between supporters on certain topics and hopefully 
    that will grow in the future when we gain more experience 
    working together.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    I have asked around and it seems our stories of joining the country 
    team are quite similar. People somehow gained in interest in Free 
    Software and found the FSFE as the designated party to uphold these 
    values in Europe. Then they found out about the NL country team, 
    joined the mailing list and attended a physical meeting. André also 
    met Felix at Linux Nijmegen as it was close to him, but for Kevin 
    living on the other side of the country the T-Dose conference was 
    the first time to physically meet the community. If anything I 
    think it highlights the importance of letting people know you exist as a 
    local team, being open to newcomers, and making it easy to join 
    community meetings.

<div class="question">
  <p>
    <strong>
      What are your recommendations for others who want to start local 
      activities for the FSFE? Although the Netherlands FSFE country team 
      was already formed when you joined, could you recall 
      some of the early activities carried out there? 
    </strong>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">

  <p>
    First, I think it is good to know what sets the FSFE apart from 
    other organizations. In the Netherlands, there are various other 
    groups with similar or even the same members, like a Linux user 
    group, a Debian community, the digital rights organization Bits of 
    Freedom. and multiple hacker spaces. Although at the FSFE we talk 
    plenty about technology, our focus at the FSFE is to inform the 
    general public and to bring about policy change. As a result our 
    community has a different aim than other Free Software related 
    communities in the Netherlands, and knowing the difference can help 
    you stand out and attract like-minded people. I don't know exactly 
    how it started in the Netherlands, but the behavior I typically see 
    with forming new groups is to start with like-minded people you 
    already know, announce your presence in related communities, and 
    then just start holding open meetings and let it grow from there.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the last few years, we did experience such a growth path in the 
    Netherlands. There was already a national group that communicated 
    via mail and chat, and we would have a booth and country team 
    meeting at the yearly T-Dose conference. Other activities were 
    organized mainly when the opportunity arose. We increased our 
    frequency of contact by having a stand at the bi-monthly NLLGG 
    meeting in Utrecht where some of our supporters would be present, 
    and we had the opportunity to meet like-minded people. The online 
    get-togethers let us spend more time to grow and align our local 
    group and cause plenty of people to join the conversation. Some 
    people joined for only one meeting, which I think is fine as 
    it was still a nice way to meet, and these relationships might be 
    helpful in the future. And from these conversations new ideas for 
    activities grew. Only recently we started having a more formal 
    agenda and minutes of our meetings as we'd often have more talking 
    points than time would allow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Don't think our relative success is the straightforward execution 
    of an upfront well laid-out plan. Growing a community is very much 
    an iterative process based on learning and feedback. Our supporters 
    become active because they want to make a difference in the world, 
    and we have to find the ways that suit us best. Personally I like 
    to take things one step at a time, just make one change or do one 
    activity and see where it leads. In doing so, we have developed 
    our own way of doing things and have gained a lot of experience 
    with a variety of activities. Say we want to write a letter to 
    politicians, then we have some earlier work already lying around 
    for potential reuse, and we know already what support we can expect 
    from the FSFE Core team and what part we have to provide ourselves.

  <p>
    Our activities have been quite diverse. There is of course an 
    ongoing effort to translate information material. We wrote to 
    national and local politicians on multiple occasions based on 
    various developments and news articles. We took part in multiple 
    consultations on laws and policies and offered our expertise on 
    free software to government. We have had stands at the yearly 
    T-Dose conference and bi-monthly NLLGG meetings. We handed out FSFE 
    tool flyers in a university and a library. We gave presentations 
    about Free Software. We helped organize an Educational Freedom Day 
    and the SHA hacker camp. We organized a privacy café at Erasmus 
    University to educate media students about solutions to protect 
    your privacy. We hosted a Freedomvote for national elections. And 
    we were involved in the court case for the source code of Debat 
    Direct. From the diversity of topics and methods it is apparent 
    that activities were sparked from opportunity or interest by our 
    community members. The campaigns from the FSFE help us to 
    prioritize and link our efforts to a topic, but we don't feel 
    constrained to just the campaigns. I have found that politics 
    especially requires a strong organization because topics can become 
    big quite quickly.  Ideally, you want to play into that attention 
    span and so you have to act fast. Also politics revolves around the 
    election cycles and so every couple of years you have to start all 
    over explaining to politicians why Free Software is common sense 
    and should be on their agenda.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p>
    <strong>
      How did you get involved in Free Software in the first place?
    </strong>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    From a young age I spent a significant amount of time on the computer, 
    experimenting with various software also as a creative outlet. 
    Being a kid I mostly started out with gratis software that came 
    bundled with our computer or printer. With the arrival of unlimited 
    internet downloading, other software became an option. I learned 
    about the importance of open standards and access to software 
    because I had encountered situations where I could no longer open 
    my files as software had become unavailable due to operating system 
    incompatibility or the expiration of the trial duration. Using 
    various gratis software over time I found out that the Free 
    Software was generally the best, not having annoying advertisements 
    or spyware and generally being well-documented. I learned the value 
    of Free Software and Open Standards the hard way, from a practical 
    standpoint, and so it was not very explicit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once at the University studying Electrical Engineering, I learned 
    more about programming and how computers were built. But during 
    that time I also learned more about privacy and security and how my 
    privacy was actually being violated by a lot of services I was 
    using. Being technically educated it was clear to me that to 
    guarantee privacy and security in the long run you need control 
    over technology and so over the software you are using. Following 
    this reasoning led me to discover the philosophy behind Free 
    Software. The value of Free Software felt so logical at that point 
    I asked myself why I did not find out about it earlier. Not just 
    the practical implications of it, but also the philosophy behind 
    it. I felt that Free Software needed more promotion to the general 
    public and that is why I joined the FSFE, to support their effort 
    in promoting this common sense.

      Can you tell us one of the stories that still warm up your heart 
      or that always makes you laugh or smile when you remember it?

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I always have a laugh thinking back to the time I visited Open 
    Rhein Ruhr with Maurice in 2016. If I remember correctly, we got a 
    call in the morning by Matthias Kirschner that we had to bring 
    &#39;Bügel&#39; (clothing hangers) to hang the T-shirts at the 
    stands. Normally Maurice and I could cope with the German we got 
    taught in secondary school, but this time it failed us. Maurice 
    understood the world &#39;Bügel&#39; to mean a clothing iron from 
    the conversation (&quot;Bügeleisen&quot;), assuming the T-shirts 
    were crinkled and had to be ironed. As Matthias had asked for two, 
    Maurice asked me to bring mine as well. So we both added our 
    clothing irons to the luggage and off we went. Only when we arrived 
    at the booth did we find out about the miscommunication and had a 
    great laugh about it. We took this memorable picture posted on the

<div class="question">
  <p>
    <strong>As a last question, what do you wish the FSFE for the next 20 years?</strong>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I wish the FSFE will gain more active local supporters. I think the 
    FSFE stands out from other organizations with the topics it 
    addresses, and I would love to see each European nation have a 
    fruitful local group to table the topic on a national level. In a 
    world using mostly the same software and being bound by the same EU 
    directives, the foundation of our activities will probably be 
    similar in all countries. But each country comes with a different 
    language, different political system, different values and norms, 
    and various other differences. By having a strong local 
    representation, the FSFE can be 'united in diversity' (EU motto) and 
    be more effective in bringing about change. I also wish this 
    because I have a good time being part of the FSFE and a local group, 
    and I think there are a lot of like-minded people that would also 
    enjoy it. So I wish other supporters can be a part of a local group 
    and also experience the value of community.

<h3>About "20 Years FSFE"</h3>

  <p>
    In 2021 the Free Software Foundation Europe turns 20. This means 
    two decades of <a href="/about/about.html">empowering users to 
    control technology</a>.

  <p>
    Turning 20 is a time when we like to take a breath and to look back 
    on the road we have come, to reflect the milestones we have passed, 
    the successes we have achieved, the stories we have written, and 
    the moments that brought us together and that we will always 
    joyfully  remember. In 2021 we want to give momentum to the 
    FSFE and even more to our pan-European community, the community 
    that has formed  and always will form the shoulders that our 
    movement relies on.

    <strong>20 Years FSFE is meant to be a celebration of everyone who 
    has accompanied us in the past or still does. Thank you for your 
    place in the structure of the FSFE today and for setting the 
    foundation for the next decades of software freedom to 
    come.</strong>
