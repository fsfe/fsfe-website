	Dear Zangemann,<br/>
	I don’t like the fact that you want to try and control people. I have been admiring you most of my life but now I just realised what you’re trying to do and I think it’s just childish. You’ve made ice cream stop in the afternoon, canceled the speakers and more. And please tell me how you are the richest man and yet you’re so greedy and there is a little eight year old girl doing better! I would like if you could could start sharing your ideas please take my advice and stop being so greedy.
