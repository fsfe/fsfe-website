<p>The Freedom Task Force is a legal infrastructure project that helps individuals, projects and businesses understand Free Software and the opportunities that it presents.  The FTF is primarily focused on licensing and works in partnership with gpl-violations.org to deal with licence violations in the European arena.</p>

<h3>Answering Questions:</h3>

<p>We can help answer common questions that people may have regarding Free Software and the licences used throughout the community. <a href="contact.html">Ask a question</a></p>

<h3>Licence Enforcement:</h3>

<p>We work in partnership with <a href="http://gpl-violations.org" target="_blank">gpl-violations.org</a> to resolve licensing issues.  We seek to solve problems for the long-term benefit of Free Software instead of regarding each case as an isolated problem.  Our goal is to educate people in the proper use of Free Software. <a href="/projects/ftf/enforcement.html">Learn more...</a></p>

<h3>Fiduciary Services:</h3>

<p>We can act as the legal guardian of Free Software projects.  We can consolidate and manage the legal side of things while you focus on ensuring your project reaches its full potential.  We can also help consolidate your copyright under your own administrative umbrella with the Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA). <a href="/projects/ftf/fiduciary.html">Learn more...</a></p>
