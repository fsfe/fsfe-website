<h1>Refund4Freedom +++ Legal Corner +++ SFP</h1>

<p>May kept us quite busy attending conferences and with the kick-off of
the Refund4Freedom initiative. We also went through the issue of the
threshold of originality for copyrightable source code and talked in our
latest episode of the Software Freedom Podcast about the tech
sovereignty debate in the EU.</p>

<h3 id="quote-of-the-month">Quote of the Month</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>“It was love at first sight with Ada &amp; Zangemann: stickers on my
		laptop, and a spark in my classroom. The real magic happens when my high
		school students enter primary schools and I tell the younger kids: ‘Go
		on, adopt a big kid.’ You can see their eyes light up with wonder as
		they whisper to each other, connected by curiosity and 
		joy"</p><cite>Giacomo Alessandroni, engineer and teacher. Organizer of 
		Ada &amp;
		Zangemann readings in Italy with a focus on robotics.</cite>

<h3 id="refund">Refund4Freedom project: Kick off in Italy!</h3>
<p><a href="https://refund4freedom.org/">Refund4Freedom</a>, a new
initiative by the Italian Linux Society (ILS) and the Free Software
Foundation Europe (FSFE) launched on 29 May. This project wants to make
it easier for computer users to claim refunds for unused pre-installed
software. By demanding 
refunds for unwanted pre-installed software, Refund4Freedom helps users 
avoid unnecessary costs while encouraging
device neutrality and user-controlled choices.
<br/><br/>Refund4Freedom is one of a broader set of activities 
empowering end-users' rights.</p>

users to 
keep using their current hardware by switching to Free Software 
operating systems, is there to help. The FSFE suopports this initiative.

<h3 id="sfp">SFP#34: Policy and EU: Tech sovereignty debate in
the EU</h3>
<p>Dive with us into the inner workings of the European Parliament and
learn about their approach on technological sovereignty. <a 
href="/news/podcast/episode-34.html">In this 34th

<h3 id="legal-corner">Legal Corner: The threshold of originality for
copyrightable source code</h3>
<p>As a general rule, software source code is by default protected by
copyright. Copyright holders create Free Software by applying a Free
Software license to their code. Creative works, such as source code,
nevertheless must be sufficiently original in nature before they can be
protected by copyright. Exactly what is this “threshold of originality”,
and are there types of code that are not automatically protected by
copyright?</p>
