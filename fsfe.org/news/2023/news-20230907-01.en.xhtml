<p>Together with the <a href="https://bglug.it/">Bergamo Linux User Group</a>, the FSFE is celebrating 
the Software Freedom Day with the Italian Free Software community. On 
September 16th, we will be celebrating this occasion with the first 
Italian reading of the book ‘Ada &amp; Zangemann – A tale of software, 
skateboards, and raspberry ice cream’, a reading for people from 6 to 
106 years old.  Moreover, there will be a workshop afterwards for the 
little ones and free home-made ice cream, courtesy of a FSFE

<h3>Ada &amp; Zangeman – A tale of software, skateboards, and raspberry ice cream</h3>
<p>The illustrated book 'Ada &amp; Zangemann - a tale of software, 
skateboards, and raspberry ice cream', written by <a 
href="https://k7r.eu/">Matthias Kirschner</a> and illustrated by <a 
href="http://sandra-brandstaetter.com/">Sandra 
Brandstätter</a>, tells the story of the famous inventor Zangemann 
and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment with 
hardware and software, and in the process realises how crucial it is 
for her and others to control technology.</p>

<div> <blockquote><p>"Ada &amp; Zangemann proves that the argument for 
software and hardware freedom is simple: We should be able to do what 
we want with our stuff... Electronics freedom means more learning and 
less waste, as Ada shows. Kids and adults alike will be entertained by 
this book, charmed by its illustrations, and inspired by Ada’s 
engineering spirit and impassioned activism."</p> <p class="author"> - 
Elizabeth Chamberlain, Director of Sustainability, 
iFixit</p></blockquote> </div>

<div>
<blockquote><p>"Ada &amp; Zangemann is not only a utopian and charming 
story about Free Software and computers, but it is one about 
self-empowerment and also about joy in technology... it may well be 
an eye-opener for adults, too."</p> <p class="author"> - Dr. Constanze 
Kurz, Spokesperson, Chaos Computer Club (CCC)</p></blockquote> 
</div>

<p>The book is currently available by the following publishers:</p>

</ul> 

<p> The book is published under a Creative Commons By Share Alike

other languages. As this process takes time and a lot of work, it would 
be great if you could <a href="https://share.fsfe.org/apps/forms/s/9MozK3FsYxjiKdWQ33bmCpRL">fill 
in this short survey</a> to check which languages you are interested 
in, so that we can  better prioritise.</p>

<p> The book is also a great gift for our loved ones, as well as a 
donation to libraries and schools to arouse more people's interest in 
tinkering with hardware and software, and encourage them to shape their 
own technology!</p>
