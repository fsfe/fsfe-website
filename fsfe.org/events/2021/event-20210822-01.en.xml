      <p>On Sunday, 22 August at 10:00 a.m. (CEST), Alexander Sander, FSFE's Policy Consultant, will talk about the latest developments in the digitalisation of administrations and venture an outlook for the time after the federal elections. More and more administrations are following the principle &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; and rely on Free Software. Last year, however, it became clear that there is still a long way to go. The lecture will examine what role the principle of Public Money? Public Code! principle played during the last year and what challenges we will face in the coming years.</p>
