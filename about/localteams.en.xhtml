    <h1>Local FSFE Groups</h1>

    <p>
      Today, the FSFE has some paid staff to make daily operation smooth and possivle. Still, our work would not be possible without the help of our volunteers and the backening of our community. Many of them cooperate via Internet or other media, while other prefer to meet people in real life. That's how local FSFE meetings have been established. If you are looking for contact, if you are looking for information or if you like to join a group, you can see your local contact partner on this page.
