<h1>FTF and gpl-violations release a guide to reporting and fixing licence violations</h1>

<p>FSFE's Freedom Task Force (FTF) and GPL-Violations.org today released a guide to reporting and fixing licence compliance issues. This guide will help users and developers to deal with license violation reports. It explains how to make a report, what information is useful to include, and offers suggestions for how projects or businesses can deal with reports once they are received.</p>

<p><a href="/activities/ftf/reporting-fixing-violations.html">The guide</a> is released as part of the strategic partnership between the FTF and GPL-Violations.org, who work together to improve licensing awareness and compliance in Europe.  It is located on the new FTF website, <a
href="/ftf/">https://fsfe.org/ftf/</a>, along with information on how projects and businesses can get help with understanding Free Software licences.  Translations into several European languages will be made available during coming weeks from the FTF website.</p>

<p>"The best way to solve compliance issues is to prevent them happening in the first place", says Shane Coughlan, FTF Coordinator. "We work to support this by educating the community at large. When problems do occur, we want people to be able to share information and resolve them effectively."</p>

<h2>About the Freedom Task Force</h2>

   <p>The Freedom Task Force is a project run by Free Software Foundation 
   Europe to help people understand Free Software licensing and the 
   opportunities it presents.  We offer educational services, facilitate 
   larger infrastructure activities and manage FSFE's legal affairs.  
   Our goals are to share knowledge about Free Software law, to

   support the long-term sustainability of Free Software.</p>
