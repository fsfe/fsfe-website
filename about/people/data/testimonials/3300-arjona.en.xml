      If software is licensed as free software, we can audit it, and be sure
      that it does what it's intended to do (and nothing else). Public
      institutions develop software, and hire companies to make it, and the
      citizens should own and reuse all that code. I contribute to Free
      Software with translations, user help desk, finding free software
      alternatives at the University... but I cannot reach the policy-makers,
      nor people and institutions in other countries.
