      <p>On the “I Love Free Software Day” on February 14, the Berlin group of the Free Software Foundation Europe invites you to a workshop on personal digital independence in the workshop room of the Pablo Neruda Library.</p>

      <p>Software has long determined many aspects of our daily lives. Many decisions are made with the help of digital assistants. Digital independence seems to be a distant prospect. After a short introductory talk on Free Software and Digital Independence, we will take a few minutes to present our favorite everyday helpers and then divide into small groups to discuss everyday problems with software.</p>

      <p>The workshop will take place on February 14, 2026, from 2 to 4 p.m. at the Pablo Neruda District Central Library (Frankfurter Allee 14 A, 10247 Berlin). The event will be in German, though English conversations are possible. Participation in the workshop is free of charge.</p>

      <p>Please register at <a href="https://share.fsfe.org/apps/forms/s/XoKKdXNaH9kPEz6PqQEdJNe2">this link/a> so that we have an overview of the number of participants.</p>
