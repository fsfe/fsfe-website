  <h1>Community</h1>

  <h2>Public Discussion</h2>

  <p>The FSFE provides infrastructure to foster public discussion on 
  Free Software topics. Everybody is encouraged to freely state their 
  opinions on these platforms, but please keep the <a 
  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1855.txt">netiquette guidelines</a> 
  in mind.  In particular be aware that discussions inside the FSFE's technical infrastructure are covered by our <a href="/about/codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</a> that kindly asks all participants to be excellent to each other.</p>
  <p>Opinions voiced in the public discussion are not official 
  positions of the FSFE.  For official statements see our <a 
  href="/contact/press.html">press release lists</a> or <a 
  href="/contact/contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="mailinglist">Mailing Lists</h3>

  <p>
   We have a number of mailing lists for local groups as well as thematic
   teams. You can find a complete list of the public lists on our
   <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/">mailing list server</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="discourse">Discourse - Forum</h3>
  
  <p>We are experiencing with <a href="https://community.fsfe.org">Discourse</a>, a forum-like discussion platform, as a volunteer-run service provided by the FSFE but still in a beta phase. It serves as a test case for specific topics and will be evaluated over time whether it fits in the FSFE’s communication setup and mission. You are welcome to become part of this new service and help us improving it.</p>

  <h3 id="irc">Internet Relay Chat and XMPP Rooms</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Server: conference.jabber.fsfe.org</li>

  </ul>
  <p>Other channels can be found with the room search of your XMPP client.</p>
