	[ Report prepared by <a
	href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/fsfe-portugal/">fsfe-portugal@gnu.org</a>
	list ]

	<p/>
	The members of the list fsfe-portugal have taken the first
	steps towards the goal of forming a support association for a
	future Chapter of the <a
	href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/">FSFE</a> in Portugal.

	<p/>
	From the early moments when the FSFE created its public
	mailing lists, some Portuguese list members have been present
	in the discussion (Klaus Schilling, Frederico Muñoz); to give
	an example, Portuguese was the first language in which the
	<a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/press/">FSFE Press
	Releases</a> were translated (F. Muñoz) - and are still
	being translated and sent to the local media - apart from the
	3 'official' languages; after an initial time were inertia
	won, it became apparent that a specialized list to deal with
	the number of Portuguese-speaking members was necessary, since
	there was much interest, among many subscribers, to form a
	Portuguese national Chapter of the FSFE; around April the
	<a
	href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/fsfe-portugal/">fsfe-portugal@gnu.org</a>
	mailing list was set up by <a
	href="http://www.dachary.org/loic/">Loic Dachary</a>
	who has encouraged us to follow the good example of the 
	<a href="http://france.fsfeurope.org/">French Chapter of the FSFE</a>
	and <a href="http://www.april.org/">APRIL</a>.

	<p/>
	
	The list began with around 12 people, and its first objective
	was to allow its members to get to know each other better;
	soon enough the discussion about the legal things needed to
	fulfill the goal begun, with several members already
	experienced in forming associations (Ruben Mendes, F. Muñoz,
	Hugo Nogueira) stepping up and advising on some initial
	decisions that would have to be made. Jaime Villate has served
	as a liaison with the FSF and the FSFE; with several years of
	participation in free software in general and his recent
	contributions to the GNU Project and personal acquaintance
	with some people in the FSF - not to mention the deep
	involvement in several national GNU/Linux websites and free
	software related activities - Jaime coordinates the efforts of
	the Portuguese group and has been influential in bringing more
	people to the project and in helping the FSFE in several ways.

	<p/>

	One of the first tasks was to help with the creation of a new
	site for the FSFE (J. Villate, Loic Dachary), in time for the
	public announcement of the creation of the FSFE; soon after,
	the members of the fsfe-portugal list undertook the
	translation of the FSFE website into Portuguese, and that was
	in a sense a proving ground for our ability to work together
	(João Miguel Neves coordinated the effort, with R. Mendes, H.
	Nogueira, F. Muñoz). It can gladly be said that such ability
	is present in a high degree, since most of the site was
	quickly translated into Portuguese, with the members sharing
	opinions and information about the translation of several
	terms, use of the <a
	href="http://france.fsfeurope.org/server/server.en.html#XHTML%20and%20XSLT%20Quick%20Start/">XHTML
	scheme</a> and <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org">Savannah</a>,
	etc. Not only
	that but some members are also taking up tasks in the FSFE
	website.

	<p/>

	New members are joining in a steady rate, partly due to the
	effort made to get the FSFE noticed by a larger audiency by
	releasing several messages and news to national websites; if
	the FSFE was largely unknown in Portugal some months ago, that
	situation has changed - and is changing more as time
	passes. There are roughly 30 people subscribed to the list
	now, and an IRC channel (#fsfe-pt) on the OpenProjects Network
	was created (Matti Särkisitta) to allow more real-time contact
	between the members.

	<p/>

	One important step will be made in the 9th of June, when the
	<a href="http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/fsfe-portugal/2001-June/000177.html">first
	meeting will take place in Oporto</a>; this meeting is being
	prepared and anticipated from some time now and will provide a
	privileged occasion to discuss things in more detail and to
	meet personally. On the agenda is the discussion of the legal
	status and name of the organization, distribution of tasks, a
	general reflection about the FSFE and our collaboration with
	it and a small key-signing party.

	<p/>

	In conclusion, the initial steps to facilitate the
	participation of FSFE in Portugal have been taken, and the
	creation of a support association is underway; after this
	first meeting more work is to be distributed and we expect to
	see more members joining as we spread the word. After someone
	from our group is accredited by the FSFE core team, it is safe
	to assume that there will exists a real possibility of having
	a FSFE Chapter Portugal in the short/medium term; among GNU
	members, Debian developers, people involved in setting up some
	of the foremost national free software websites, people
	involved in several ways with the free software ideals for
	years and newcomers with a great will to get the work done, we
	have a good human potential to build this reality.

	<p/>

	The future looks bright :)
