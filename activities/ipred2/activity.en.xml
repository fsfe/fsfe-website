    <title>IPRED2</title>
    <description>
      A second directive on the enforcement of &quot;intellectual
      property rights&quot; has been proposed by the European
      Commission.  It aims to criminalise all &quot;intentional,
      commercial-scale&quot; infringements, and to allow rights-holders
      to take part investigations. The FSFE pointed out to the EU
      institutions how such laws encourage abuse of the legal system
      and have chilling effects on law-abiding activities.
