  <h3>Decide yourself what you code</h3>

  <p>
    There is no set challenge or topic for the software you should develop.
    Embrace your imagination and create what is the most interesting to you. It
    can address an everyday problem you have, or it can be just fun. It can be a
    standalone program that you write from scratch, or you can modify and
    combine existing programs. <a href="/activities/yh4f/faq.html#what-type-of-software-should-i-make-">The
    possibilities are endless</a>. A vital condition for the competition is that
    the program should be <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free
    Software</a>, so that others can use, study, share, and improve the code in
    the future.
  </p>

 <h3>Take the time you need</h3>

  <p>
    From Thursday 1 December 2022 to Friday 31 March 2023, you will have four
    months to come up with an idea for a Free Software program and write it.
    Enjoy the <a href="/activities/yh4f/faq.html#2-coding-phase">coding
    period</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Present your program to top experts</h3>

  <p>
    Your software project will be in good hands, as it will be evaluated by Free
    Software experts. <em><a href="/activities/yh4f/jury.html">Our jury
    members</a></em> excel in software development and are deeply involved in
    the Free Software movement. At the same time, they are excellent people to
    work with. After you submit your program, you will have the chance to
    present it to them, as part of your evaluation. This is a nice opportunity
    for you to discuss your idea and your achievement with experienced people in
    the field.

  <h3>Awesome awards and experiences await</h3>

  <p>
    Based on the jury’s grades, the winners will be determined and announced.
    The first six places will be awarded  <em>cash between 4.096€ and 1.024€
    each</em>. The <a href="/activities/yh4f/faq.html#4-award-ceremony">Award
    Ceremony</a> of YH4F will take place in Brussels in June 2023. All the
    winners will be invited there with covered costs. The Award Ceremony will
    have top speakers in the field of Free Software and it will be a time of
    celebration. You made it! Your hard work paid off. Now you can enjoy 2
    educative and exciting days in Brussels and socialise with fellow winners.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Last year was the first time that the YH4F took place. We had the 
    pleasure to receive many interesting and inspired projects from all 
    around Europe. The <a href="/news/2022/news-20221004-01.html">six 
    winning projects</a> were inspiring.
