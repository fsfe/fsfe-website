<h2 id="about-the-fsfe">About the FSFE </h2>

<p>
Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to 
control technology.  Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our 
lives and it is important that technology empowers rather than 
restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, 
understand, adapt, and share software. These rights help 
support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press, 
and privacy. 
</p>

<p>
The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how 
Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and 
self-determination. It enhances users' rights by abolishing 
barriers to Free Software adoption, encourages people to use and 
develop Free Software, and provides resources to enable everyone to 
further promote Free Software in Europe. 
</p>

<p>
We are involved in many activities in the legal, economic, political, 
and technical areas around Free Software. Our work is made possible by 
a community of volunteers, supporters, donors, and staff. 
</p>
