      <p>
      As every year, FSFE will attend FrOSCon with a booth. Our education team
      will participate in the <a href="http://kids.froscon.de/">Froglabs
        program for kids</a>, and on Saturday 11:15 our vice president,
      Matthias Kirschner, will give a talk about <a
        href="http://programm.froscon.de/2014/events/1321.html">"An endangered
        species: the computer as a universal machine"</a> (in German). The
      event takes place at the Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Science,
      Grantham-Allee 20, 53757 Sankt Augustin. Normal tickets are 5â‚¬ for both
      days, and can be bought onsite or soon in our presale (there is also the
      option for business tickets to support the event).
