        <title>SFSCON '23 - Let’s monitor implementation of Free Software Policies!</title>

    <body>
    <p>For six years, the Free Software Foundation Europe has been calling with a broad alliance for publicly funded software to be published as Free Software.</p> 
     <p>In the talk, Linus Sehn and Johannes Näder, will look at some examples of lack of implementation of Free Software policies. They will discuss how we, as civil society, can identify such shortcomings and how to deal with them. They will present our initiative TEDective – a free-software solution that makes European public procurement data explorable for non-experts, aiming to provide you with a powerful tool to keep an eye on real progress towards “Public Money? Public Code!” across Europe.</p>
