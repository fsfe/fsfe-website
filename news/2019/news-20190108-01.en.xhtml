  <h2 id="aboutthefsfe">About the FSFE</h2>

  <p>Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to
  control technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our
  lives; and it is important that this technology empowers rather than
  restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use,
  understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other
  fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.</p>

  <p>The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free
  Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination.
  It enhances users' rights by abolishing barriers to Free Software
  adoption, encourages people to use and develop Free Software, and
  provides resources to enable everyone to further promote Free Software
  in Europe.</p>

  projects around Free Software (see <a
