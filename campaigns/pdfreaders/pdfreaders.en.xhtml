        What would you think about a sign on the highway stating “You need a
        Volkswagen to drive on this road. Contact your Volkswagen dealer for a
        gratis test drive – Your Government”? When it comes to PDF reading
        software, many governments do this every day.  With the <a
          href="http://www.pdfreaders.org">pdfreaders.org</a> campaign we will
        turn the spotlight on public institutions who behave in this way, exposing how
        frequently such non-Free advertisements appear.  
      </p>

    <h2>How to participate</h2>

    <p>
      Every day, public institutions advertise non-free software on their
      websites.  With the help of our <a
        href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org/">Fellows</a> we have collected
      some examples:
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/finanzBrandenburg.png"><img src="/campaigns/pdfreaders/finanzBrandenburg_p.png" alt="Finance ministry Brandenburg" /></a>
      <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/FPmt.png"><img src="/campaigns/pdfreaders/FPmt_p.png" alt="Foreign ministry Malta" /></a>
      <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/SachsenJustiz.png"><img src="/campaigns/pdfreaders/SachsenJustiz_p.png" alt="Justice ministry Sachsen" /></a>
      <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/education.png"><img src="/campaigns/pdfreaders/education_p.png" alt="ministère de l'éducation France" /></a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Help us to find out where public institutions advertise non-free software.
      Together we will encourage them to spread Free Software
      instead.
