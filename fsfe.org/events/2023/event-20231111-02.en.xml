        <title>SFSCON '23 - Free Software and Open Science in Bolzano, Italy</title>

    <body>
      <p>The Open Science movement aims to increase the transparency, reproducibility and inclusiveness of academic research. One of its central goals is therefore to make research outputs broadly available, e.g., manuscripts (Open Access) or research data (Open Data). While software/code created in the course of scientific research is a key artifact of scientific research that is clear distinct from the latter two, it has until recently not received the same attention as manuscripts or data, although it follows its own set of paradigms.</p>
      <p>In this talk, FSFE volunteer Christian Busse, will present an overview on how the core concepts of Free Software and the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reuseable) Principles intersect, what this means for managing code as research output and recent initiatives on the European level that will provide support for these issues.<br/>
