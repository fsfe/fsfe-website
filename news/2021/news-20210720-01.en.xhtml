<h1>FSFE: 20 years of empowering people to control technology</h1>

  <p>
    Marking twenty years of the FSFE, we highlight the importance of 
    software freedom in Europe and important 
    accomplishments since 2001. We shed light on our community with a 
    birthday page where you can find community interviews and videos. 
    People are invited to celebrate with us and share their own 
    stories.
  </p>

  <p>
	Long before the first smartphone was introduced, it was evident for 
	the FSFE&#39;s founders that it is the people who should be in 
	control of technology and not vice versa. In 2001 Free Software 
	experts around Europe thus <a 
	href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2001q2/000003.html">created</a> 
	the Free Software Foundation Europe. 20 years later, we successfully 
	concentrate our daily work on <a 
	href="https://fsfe.org/about/ourwork.en.html">three main 
	pillars</a> to help software freedom thrive in Europe: public 
	awareness, policy advocacy and legal support.
  </p>

<h2>Our highlights</h2>

  <p>
	In 2021 the well-known FSFE looks back on a successful history with 
	major success in the public, legal, and policy field. For example 
	in 2005, when our intense <a 
	href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2004q2/000057.html">campaigning</a> 
	and collaboration with other organisations persuaded the European 
	Parliament to <a 
	href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2005q3/000109.html">vote</a> 
	against Software Patents. Or two years later, when the European 
	Court of Justice court aligned with the FSFE, <a 
	href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.html">requiring 
	Microsoft to publish interoperability information</a>. It was 
	during that time that the need to support Free Software developers 
	by clarifying the legal aspects of their work, such as the 
	enforcement in case of license violations, led to the FSFE starting 
	to work with Free Software legal advocates and practitioners for 
	legal initiatives in 2006.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, the FSFE maintains <a 
	href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/ln.en.html">the world&#39;s 
	largest professional network on legal issues related to Free 
	Software</a>. The FSFE&#39;s legal experts on this network help 
	with concrete licensing consultancy for all. To this end we also 
	created the highly successful <a 
	href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> initiative to provide a 
	set of recommendations that make licensing Free Software projects 
	easier for developers. REUSE has been adopted by well known 
	projects such as the German Corona Warn App and the KDE.
  </p>
  <p>
	Since its founding,the FSFE is committed to running public 
	campaigns, helping people to understand the benefits of Free 
	Software. As early as 2012, we helped users to overcome software 
	restrictions in their phones with the launch of our <a 
	href="https://fsfe.org/activities/android/">&#39;Free Your 
	Android&#39; campaign</a>. Two years earlier we introduced <a 
	href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ilovefs/index.en.html">&quot;I 
	love Free Software day&quot;</a> which is celebrated around the 
	globe every year on 14 February. In 2017, we launched the 
	extraordinarily successful <a 
	href="https://publiccode.eu/">&#39;Public Money? Public Code!&#39; 
	campaign</a>, convincing several public administrations to change 
	their IT strategy. The accompanying  <a 
	href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">open letter</a> is signed 
	by over 200 civil society organisations, 31.000 individuals, and 
	several public administrations like the city of Barcelona and the 
	Swedish JobTech Development center.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Of course, all these accomplishments can only give a glimpse of the 
    impact of the FSFE and our activities in the last 20 years. Still, 
    they do not tell how all these successes are the result of our 
    large community that we can rely on. To at least shed light on some 
    of them we created the <a 
	href="https://fsfe.org/activities/20years/20years.html/">FSFE20 campaign</a>
    this year and hand over the mic to our community.
  </p>

<h2>FSFE20 campaign: handing over the mic to our community</h2>

  <p>
    We contacted people who paved the way of the FSFE since its beginning, 
    such as long term contributors and past staffers. In a series of 
    interviews we discussed the progress of the FSFE as well as 
    technological topics. Every person who is involved in the FSFE has 
    unique memories, expertise, and hopes for the future. They are all part 
    of the story of 20 Years FSFE.
