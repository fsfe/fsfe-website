    <title>Blog: Software patents in Europe: game on</title>
    <body>
      <p> Should Europe have software patents? The discussion is back in full
        force. After the European Parliament rejected patents on software in
        2005, things went quiet for a while.  Now the European Parliament is
        about to decide on setting up a single patent for Europe, known as the
        “unitary patent”. This is a chance to get rid of software patents. But
        if we don’t manage to achieve a real change in the current proposal,
        software patents will become even more entrenched in Europe.  Get
        active, and let's get rid of software patents once and for all!  </p>
