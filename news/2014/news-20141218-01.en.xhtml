        <h1>Happy Birthday April!</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes"><a href="//april.org">April</a>, France's leading Free Software advocacy organisation, was founded 18 years ago today.<br />April was set up in December 1996 by students in a Paris university as a not-for-profit group to promote Free Software in computer science research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Here at FSFE, we wish April a very happy birthday, and congratulate everyone who works with them on the organisation's many achievements,” says FSFE's President Karsten Gerloff. “April's persistence, their experience and their professionalism make them a great and important organisation in the Free Software world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the spring of 2014, volunteers of the FSFE all over Europe contributed to April's <a href="http://freesoftwarepact.eu">Free Software Pact</a> campaign, providing the platform with translations in several languages and convincing many of the candidates standing for election to the European Parliament to sign the pact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“April's commitment to spreading Free Software ideals to the general public, and to raising awareness about its longstanding benefits for society, is a sign for hope, and motivates us all to continue our work toward a free society,” says Hugo Roy, FSFE's coordinator for France (and himself a member of April).</p>
