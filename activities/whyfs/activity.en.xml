    <title>We speak about Free Software</title>
    <description>
      Free Software is often referred to as "Open Source". But we are
      convinced that Free Software is the better term: easier to
      understand, harder to abuse, well-defined, providing additional
      value, and offering freedom. We connected companies,
      organisations and even co-founders of the Open Source movement
      that prefer to use the term Free Software.
