<h1>REUSE goes to space!</h1>

<p>The German Aerospace Center (DLR) has adopted the REUSE 
specification in some of its projects. We have talked to Tobias 
Schlauch, research software engineer at the DLR, about the role of Free 
Software for research and innovation, and the importance of clear 
understanding and displaying of the legal information of software 
projects. He highlights the special contributions that REUSE has to 
offer for software development but also for research.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> initiative, started 
by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), makes licensing easy for 
humans and machines alike. With REUSE, we solve a fundamental issue 
that Free Software licensing has at the very source: what license is a 
file licensed under, and who owns the copyright? A set of best 
practices and the helper tool make the task of adding this legal 
information in every single file of the project a simple practice.</p>
 
<p>The number of projects implementing REUSE in their workflows is 
steadily increasing. This is the case for some projects of the German 
Aerospace Center (<em>Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt 
e.V</em> - DLR), which are now REUSE compliant. To learn more about the 
state of Free Software at the DLR, the implementation of the FSFE’s 
REUSE, and how research and software freedom intertwine, we interviewed 
Tobias Schlauch. </p> 

<p>Tobias is a research software engineer at the 
<a href="https://www.dlr.de/sc/en/"><em><em>Institute for Software 
Technology</em></em></a> at DLR since 2005. He currently serves as the 
representative of the <a href="https://rse.dlr.de/"><em><em>DLR 
Software Engineering Initiative</em></em></a>. In this position, he 
organises the DLR research software community and coordinates the 
DLR-wide application of software engineering methods, processes, and 
tools.</p> 

<p><strong>FSFE: Welcome Tobias, and thank you for taking 
the time to let us know more about the work carried out by DLR, especially 
when it comes to Free Software and a proper licensing and copyright 
displaying of such projects. Let’s start from the beginning: why is 
software a core activity of the research carried out by 
DLR?</strong></p>

 <p><strong>Tobias Schlauch: </strong>DLR is a large 
research organization in Germany with more than 10,000 employees which 
are organized in 54 research institutes and facilities. Aeronautics, 
space, energy, transport, and digitalisation are currently its main 
research domains. Software development plays an important role in all 
of them and is a driver of innovation.</p> 

<p>Overall, you can find a 
wide variety of developed software at DLR in terms of application 
domain and required maturity level. For example, software is developed 
to help investigating specific phenomena such as simulation of air flow 
around flight configurations. Another typical use case is the 
processing, analysis and visualization of scientific data. Moreover, 
there are also teams developing software for critical space missions 
such as control software of satellites.</p>

<p><strong>FSFE: What role does 
Free Software play within the research ecosystem at DLR? And what do 
you think are the benefits that Free Software offers to such a 
community?</strong></p> 

<p><strong>Tobias Schlauch: </strong>Free Software is an 
important basis for DLR’s software development efforts. There is likely 
no software project which does not rely on at least one Free Software 
library or uses a Free Software tool to aid in the process of software 
development. Thus, Free Software helps us to rapidly try out new things 
because we do not have to develop them from scratch. Besides these more 
efficiency-related aspects, publishing Free Software in the research 
domain helps to exchange knowledge inside a research community and 
between different research communities. In this way, Free Software can 
be a driver for innovation in research. </p> 

<p><blockquote> "Free Software is an important basis for DLR’s software development efforts.

process of software development".</blockquote></p> 

<p><strong>FSFE: In research, reusability 
is at the heart of the scientific process, yet it is still one of the 
challenges in software development research. Why do you think this is 
an issue at the moment, and what kind of measures is DLR taking to 
tackle it? How can a tool like REUSE help with these efforts?</strong></p> 

<p><strong>Tobias Schlauch: </strong>The use and reuse of software in 
research has its specific challenges. Generally, a core aspect of 
research is that you can validate and build upon the results of other 
research groups. For example, you want to be able to take the 
“ingredients” described in a scientific paper, such as data sets and 
software, and get to the same results as the authors of the paper. This 
kind of validation and reproduction of scientific results is a core 
aspect of research. However, reproducibility has become more and more 
challenging with the rise of computational research and has led to the 
so-called <a 
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a"><em><em>reproducibility 
crisis</em></em></a>. For example, still too often it is not clear 
which concrete software version has been used to achieve a 
specific result or, even worse, the used data sets and software are not 
available at all.</p>

<p>The movement towards <a 
href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fdata.2019.00043"><em><em>Open 
Science</em></em></a> tries to address this problem by establishing 
principles and practices to make research products such as software 
openly available. In this context, the <a 
href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18"><em><em>FAIR 
principles</em></em></a> provide guidance how to share research 
products to enable reuse and reproducibility. Initially, the Open 
Science community focused a lot on data but nowadays also software has 
been more and more established as a research product. Thus, there is 
also an interpretation of the <a 
href="https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00068"><em><em>FAIR principles for 
software</em></em></a>.</p> <p>An important aspect of code reuse is 
that you have a clear understanding about the licenses under which code 
is provided. In this context, <a href="https://reuse.software/"><em><em>REUSE</em></em></a> makes a 
unique contribution by providing a practical standard for documenting 
such information in a code repository while not reinventing the wheel. 
In particular, REUSE addresses the problem of multiple licenses and 
different copyright holders as it allows to precisely express such 
information on a per-file level. Finally, REUSE offers <a 
href="https://reuse.software/dev/"><em><em>really good tool 
support</em></em></a> which helps during the initial documentation 
phase and the further development by offering a linting 
functionality.</p> 

<p>At DLR, we need to transfer these Open Science 
related practices into the DLR context. This requires DLR-specific 
policies and support activities to effectively enable our researchers 
to publish research openly. The DLR software engineering initiative 
provides this practical support in context of software development. 
I.e., we foster the establishment of required tool infrastructure, 
offer guidelines, training and consulting. For example, in context of 
software publication, we offer a help desk which DLR researchers can 
approach to ask questions with regard to Free Software and software 
licenses. In addition, we also provide <a 
href="https://www.dlr.de/de/medien/publikationen/broschueren/opensource-software_dlr_2022.pdf"><em><em>Free 
Software guidelines</em></em></a> to answer common questions with 
regard to these topics.</p> 

<p><strong>FSFE: The DLR project - 
</strong><a href="https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr"><em><em><strong>CosmoScout 
VR</strong></em></em></a><strong> - has recently implemented the REUSE 
specification. How did they arrive at that decision? </strong></p> 

<p><strong>Tobias Schlauch:</strong> I approached them with the idea 
and I did not have to be too convincing. They already recognized the 
point that one single license for the whole repository does not feel 
right. REUSE allows them to be precise and to make sure that they do 
not accidentally miss an important aspect.</p> 

<p><strong>FSFE: Do you see the 
potential of more DLR projects joining CosmoScout VR in becoming REUSE 
compliant?</strong></p> 

<p><strong>Tobias Schlauch: </strong>Yes, I think so. 
Actually, there are already much more compliant code repositories out 
there. But they do not necessarily use the current REUSE badge feature. 
For example, we also provide our learning materials in Git repositories 
which we made REUSE compliant. In addition, in the DLR institute I work 
for, the Institute for Software Technology, we currently rebuild our 
software publication process and REUSE is to become a standard tool in 
it. However, I think that there is more room for adoption of REUSE on 
the wider DLR level.</p> 

<p><blockquote>“An approach such as REUSE makes it much easier to follow an established good practice… I do not 
have to think where to put a specific information such as the license 
files as REUSE gives me clear advice. In addition, REUSE helps me to 
check whether I accidentally missed something. Such tools are really, 
really important because they bring a standard into practice.”</blockquote></p> 


<p><strong>FSFE: One of your efforts within DLR has been educating and guiding 
the DLR research software development community on how to properly 
declare licensing and copyright information for their work. What would 
you say to someone working in this field to encourage them to use Free 
Software?</strong></p> 

<p><strong>Tobias Schlauch: </strong>I think that many 
researchers at DLR are already aware of Free Software and their 
benefits. However, another part of our educational efforts is to ensure 
that they are using them the “right” way. Thus, license compliance is 
an important aspect here which also starts with raising awareness. For 
example, by providing researchers small rules of thumb such as “Make 
sure that the code you want to reuse has a clear license.” or “Make the 
license a decision criterion when selecting a Free Software library”. 
In addition, we also encourage our researchers to publish their own 
developments as Free Software or, even better, contribute to existing 
Free Software projects. In this area, there is still room for 
improvement but we try to encourage them by pointing out the benefits 
of open collaboration such as improved visibility, sustainability, and 
quality of published software. Finally, when making your developed 
research software available as Free Software, you also ensure that your 
work is still available to you and the wider research community after 
your contracts end and you head over to another research 
organization.</p> 

<p><strong>FSFE: Are tools like REUSE key to educate and 
guide the rest of the research software development community?</strong></p> 

<p><strong>Tobias Schlauch: 
</strong>Yes, I think so. An approach such as REUSE makes it much 
easier to follow an established good practice. For example, I do not 
have to think where to put a specific information such as the license 
files as REUSE gives me clear advice. In addition, REUSE helps me to 
check whether I accidentally missed something. Such tools are really, 
really important because they bring a standard into practice.</p> 


<p><strong>FSFE: Indeed, DLR is not only adopting REUSE but also has 
included it as a reference within its </strong><a 
href="https://www.dlr.de/de/medien/publikationen/broschueren/opensource-software_dlr_2022.pdf"><em><em><strong>Free 
Software guidelines</strong></em></em></a><strong>. Is the DLR aiming 
to including REUSE into its licensing policy as well? How do you think 
this would benefit DLR and the research ecosystem as a 
whole?</strong></p> 

<p><strong>Tobias Schlauch: </strong>Yes, I think 
that REUSE has a good chance to be included in our DLR policies with 
regard to software publication. There are different activities planned, 
for example, in context of the adoption of the <a 
href="https://os.helmholtz.de/en/open-research-software/model-policy"><em><em>Model 
Policy on Sustainable Software at the Helmholtz Centers</em></em></a> 
at DLR. In close relation to this, we might already earlier update the 
<a href="https://rse.dlr.de/01_guidelines.html"><em><em>DLR Software 
Engineering Guidelines</em></em></a> and make REUSE the default way on 
how to document license and copyright information. The effect in the 
wider research community will take some time but I think that we can 
reach a point where we finally have a clearer picture of the license 
situation when reusing software.</p> 

<p><strong>FSFE: If you could 
improve/change something to bring the Free Software ecosystem and the 
research community closer together, what would that be?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Tobias Schlauch:</strong> I would like to remove the fear of 
researchers publishing their code as Free Software and to encourage 
them to contribute to existing Free Software projects more often.</p> 
<p><strong>FSFE: Once again thank you very much, Tobias, for your insights and 
for all the efforts you are leading within the DLR and the research 
community.</strong></p>
