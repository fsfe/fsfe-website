    <body>
	<p>On 14th of March there will be the next Berlin Fellowship meeting and it is going to take place at <a href="http://zope2.in-berlin.de:8100/wsb/elok/jc-e-lok">e-lok</a> (next to Ostkreuz). <a href="/about/people/gerloff/gerloff.en.html">Karsten Gerloff, President of the FSFE</a>, will be visiting the Fellowship meeting and is looking forward to meet you. On this occasion we are celebrating a GnuPG-Key-signing party with the slogan: "Key Signing Party - Have it signed by the President!"</p>
	<p>Besides that we will discuss Berlin's DFD award that now turned into Germany's DFD award. If you like to take part in the awarding ceremony, don't miss to come to the Fellowship meeting to discuss all details.</p>
	<p>As usual, the Fellowship meeting is a good possibility to meet other Fellows as well as other Free Software enthusiasts. You can get good food and best drinks at e-lok for a reasonable price to spend a happy evening. Official start is at 19:30.</p>
