        <title> I ‚ô• Free Software Day in Staffordshire, UK</title>

    <body>
      <p>FSFE Potteries started in 2020 when the world was a bit upside down. This is our first chance to do something big! We'll have pizza, soft drinks, and a room full of PC's running Trisquel  GNU/Linux if you fancy giving some Free Software a try. We can also play Free Software games! Bring along your friends, family, or significant other; particularly since the date of the event might prove interesting! Even if they've never heard of Free Software before, it'll be a good way to introduce them to the topic.</p>
      <p>Everyone is welcome, even if you just come for fun. Tell us about any Free Software that you are thankful for, especially if it ever got you out of a jam. <br />
‚è∞ 6:30pm arrival, 7pm main activities<br />
üìç Innovation Centre 1 building, Keele University, ST5 5NB, Staffordshire, United Kingdom.</p>
