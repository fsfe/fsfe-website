<h1>DMA &amp; Apple +++ Openwashing, EU infrastucture &amp; more</h1>

<p>
The July issue is full of news! We continue to monitor and raise 
our concerns about DMA compliance. We call  upon the EU to use Free 
Software for its digital infrastructure and are asking for your 
experiences with openwashing. And we also bring you updates on REUSE, 
YH4F, Ada &amp; Zangemann...

<h3 id="dma-apple">Defending DMA against Apple: The FSFE signs joint 
position paper</h3> 
<p>Together with seven stakeholders organisations, 
<a href="/news/2024/news-20240627-01.html">the FSFE has submitted a joint position paper to the European 
Commission</a>, with whom we are working on the implementation of the 
Digital Markets Act. This paper, supported by legal and data-backed 
arguments, addresses Apple’s non-compliance with the law, particularly 
concerning software freedom, alternative Free Software app stores and 
interoperability obligations.</p> 

<h3 id="EC-consultation">Europe needs Free Software to master its 
digital infrastructure</h3> 
<p>The FSFE calls upon the European Commission to <a href="/news/2024/news-20240701-01.html">use Free Software to ensure a secure and resilient 
digital infrastructure</a>. Also the economy, civil society and democracy will 
benefit from software freedom.</p>

<h3 id="REUSE">Save time and minimise licensing headaches with 
REUSE</h3> 
<p>REUSE helps make a project's licensing and copyright 
status more transparent, ensure that third-party code is properly 
attributed and make the project's code easily reusable. This tool is 
currently used worldwide and its specification has been adopted by 
several corporate and institutional projects. <a href="/news/2024/news-20240620-01.html
">We spoke to Matija Šuklje of Liferay International</a>, one of the companies that has adopted REUSE.</p> 

<h3 id="openwashing">Share your views on openwashing with us!</h3>
<p>We are working on the topic of openwashing to learn more about 
current market practices, and we need your help! Openwashing has 
become a growing issue for the Free Software community. Many companies 
claim to be working on "Open Source" or "Free Software", while at the 
same time distributing proprietary software products. We have already 
received many valuable responses, but <a 
href="https://share.fsfe.org/apps/forms/s/Z6xHfa8EiXk77FFreg2R6A6T
">more input is welcome!</a> You can still share your views and experiences on openwashing.</p> 
<p><strong>Please spread the word!</strong></p>

<h3 id="yh4f">YH4F: end of the programming period</h3> 
<p>The 2024 
edition of <a href="/activities/yh4f/">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</a> has reached its peak with the end of 
the programming period. After six months of working on their projects, 
the young participants of this third edition submitted their 
projects at the end of June. Now it is the turn of the YH4F jury to 
evaluate the submissions and choose the six projects that will be awarded prizes 
in Brussels in October. Keep up to date with our news! Meanwhile, <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240628-01.html">take 
a closer look at one of our winning projects </a>from last year, 
ArduPlot.</p> 
<p>Interested in participating in the next edition? <a href="http://yh4f.org/register">You can 
already register!</a></p>

<h3 id="ada-book">“Érase una vez…“, Ada in Spanish! </h3>
<p>Thanks to the Volkswagen Group in Spain, the story of Ada &amp; 
Zangemann is now being printed in Spanish! The company will be 
distributing 500 copies to its employees and, from September, its STEM 
team will be embarking on a 'STEM tour', visiting schools in several 
Spanish cities around the country to distribute the book. We can't wait 
to hear more about these readings and the children's feedback! And maybe 
this translation of the book will find a publisher soon, so that it can make 
its way 
into bookshops!</p>

<p>Besides, Ada  ready-to-go slides are currently 
<a 
href="https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/ada-zangemann/src/branch/main/Presentations">available 
in Spanish and Portuguese!</a> These resources are really 
helpful when doing a reading.</p>

<h3 id="italian-project">“They are young and they need the code”, Italian pilot project </h3>
<p>With its kick-off online meeting last month, the FSFE has started 
a pilot project in Italy to educate primary school kids about Free 
Software. This project is creating a set of tools for Italian 
volunteers to organize a pedagogic event with a reading of the book 
“Ada &amp; Zangemann”.</p> <p>If you are in Italy and you want to 
 participate, please get in touch with the FSFE ItalyTelegram channel. 
 Check out <a

 recording of the kick-off session</a> and <a

<h3 id="donate">Individual regular supporters power our work day-to-day. We need your help to continue our work!</h3>
<p>Our mission is in jeopardy due to lack of funding. Inflation has 
also hit us hard, so in order to continue to fight successfully for you 
and your freedom, we need individual, regular contributions.</p> 

<p>To continue to be a thorn in the side of deep-pocketed tech giants and a 
watchdog for governments, it is important that individual regular 
donations are a cornerstone of our income so we keep our independence.</p> 

<p>If you value our work and have the means to do so, please do not 
hesitate to <a href="/donate/donate.html">make a donation</a>; any amount you can contribute would really 
help us to continue to work consistently and tirelessly for Software 
Freedom.</p>

<h3 id="ilovefs">I ♥ Free Software Day &amp; SUSE OSCC network</h3>
<p>We got an email, a few weeks ago, that caught our attention. It came 
with a donation explaining that it was made in the name of an employee 
network at SUSE. We decided to investigate and asked the people 
responsible, and we want to <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240610-01.html">share this awesome story with 
you</a>. 
<em>(Note - this is also a great idea for an initiative to ask your company 
about)</em>.</p> 

<h3 id="summer-sale">End of the Summer Sale</h3> 
<p>Our summer sale is 
over and now is the time for us to restock! Remember that you can still <a href="/order/order.html">order our 
merchandise online</a> and also get it at our booth at several events! 
Also, if you are wearing our t-shirt and socks this summer, do not 
forget to post about it in your social media channels and <a 
href="https://mastodon.social/@fsfe">tag us</a>! We 
love to see our products all around the world, and it is a great 
way to spread the message about Free Software and Software Freedom!</p>

<h3 id="conferences">Trento Open Festival,Tübix,  Offenburg’s reading 
and Dev.Conf.CZ</h3> 
<p>The FSFE participated in the Trento Open 
Festival conference (Italy) giving some talks, participating in panel 
discussions and with reading of the book ‘Ada &amp; Zangemann: a Tale of 
Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream'. Besides, the outcome 
of the ZOOOM project was validated with different stakeholders. </p>

<p>Also, the FSFE went to Tübingen (Germany) to participate in this yearly event 
around GNU/Linux and Free Software. We had a reading of the book  
‘Ada &amp; Zangemann: a Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice 
Cream’ and a talk about banks and Free Software. And of course, a booth.</p> 

<p>Last month, we also had an Ada &amp; Zangemann reading,  in Offenburg (Germany). 
The reading was opened by Offenburg's mayor and attended by more 
than 200 third graders in Offenburg's largest cinema. The 200 pupils had the chance to 
discuss the book with the author after the reading.</p> 

<p>The illustrated book was also present at DevConf.CZ, where the FSFE shared 
experiences from readings, and  discussed how to engage with 
younger audiences about Free Software
