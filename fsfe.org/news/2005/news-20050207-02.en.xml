    <title>Software patents harm banks</title>

      <p>
        Once Basel II becomes widely used, a dramatic increase in software
        patent infringement lawsuits for this area is likely to occur on a
        global basis. Any bank or any of its customers for Basel II based
        software may become target of such legal action -- the risk is
        incalculable and can bring about multi-billion Euro lawsuits.
