    <div id="introduction">
      <div class="image">

      </div>

      <p>
        When you <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/join">join the Fellowship</a>, you
        will automatically receive two letters: One containing your
        personalised Fellowship card, a smart card containing state-of-the-art
        hardware encryption, and another one containing administrative
        information for the Fellowship card. 
      </p>
    </div>

	<h2>Personalised for you</h2>

  <p>The Fellowship smart card has a unique design that is personalised for you
  with your name and fellowship number. There are three OpenPGP subkeys on the
  smart card:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A signature subkey, used to sign email, documents and other data.</li>
		<li>An encryption subkey, used to decrypt incoming data and mail.</li>
		<li>An authentication subkey, not used for normal GnuPG operation, which allows
	  other tools like SSH or PAM modules to use the Fellowship card for
	  authentication and (remote) logins.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Features</h2>

  <p>The Fellowship card is a so-called "smart card" and requires a smart card
  reader for your computer. Using your Fellowship card in combination with a
  smart card reader, you can: </p>

	<ul>

    <li>Sign and encrypt your email.</li>

    <li>Use your Fellowship card for single sign-on at your computer.</li>

    <li>Log in remotely on your machines using SSH. Because the key is stored
    in hardware and can never leave the card, you can even do this safely from
    a potentially insecure machine.</li>

    <li>Use the Fellowship card only for subkeys of your normal GPG key, as
    described in the <a
      href="http://www.gnupg.org/howtos/card-howto/en/smartcard-howto.html">GnuPG
      Smartcard Howto</a> under <a
      href="http://www.gnupg.org/howtos/card-howto/en/ch05.html">Advanced
      Features</a> or the <a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/Card_howtos">howtos in
    our wiki</a>.  Using your Fellowship card with subkeys is recommended.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Use your imagination</h2>

    <p>The Fellowship card is indeed a very flexible token that can be used for
    many things -- use your imagination and blog about it.</p>
