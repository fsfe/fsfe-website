    "I am excited about Matthias Kirschner's children's book Ada &amp; 
    Zangemann because it not only fills an important gap of presenting 
    the concept of Free Software to children, but also because it is 
    extremely well done.  Matthias has enlisted the help of children's 
    book professionals to ensure a top-quality product. We'd like to 
    see this book published in English, and will gladly use our market 
    reach to help spread the word once it is available."
