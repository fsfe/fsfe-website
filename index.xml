    <title>Free Software Foundation Europe</title>
    <para>
      This will become the web site of the <emphasis>FSF Europe</emphasis>, an
      organization dedicated to Free Software activities in Europe. As the
      official sister organization of the <emphasis>Free Software
      Foundation</emphasis> in the United States, it will build its activities
      around the <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</ulink> although
      it won't be limited to it.
    </para>
    <para>
      Its second role will be to provide maintenance and services for the
      <emphasis>GNU Business Network</emphasis> which is also being planned
      right now. For more information about the <emphasis>GNU Business
      Network</emphasis> we recommend taking a look at the <ulink
      url="http://mailman.gnubiz.org">mailing lists</ulink> - this is where
      all the information is right now.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <emphasis>FSF Europe</emphasis> is currently in an "about to become
      reality" phase, so all we can provide at the moment is the <ulink
      url="documents/doi.html">Declaration of Intent</ulink>. If you want more
      information, we also recommend checking out the <ulink
      url="http://mailman.fsfeurope.org">mailing lists</ulink>.
