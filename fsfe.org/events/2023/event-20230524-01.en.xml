        <title>FSFE Netherlands online get-together (online) (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>On the 24th of May, the period online meeting of FSFE Netherlands will be held, in wich recent developments and activities will be discussed. The meeting will be from 20:00 until about 22:00 CEST on the conference server. It is usually quite 'gezellig' and so most stay until 23:00, but you can leave whenever you see fit. The meeting is open for everybody, and we'll switch to English if not everybody understands Dutch. More information can be found on the wiki: https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/Netherlands/2023-05-24  At the meetings we abide by the FSFE Code of Conduct. The URL of the meeting is https://conf.fsfe.org/b/netherlands</p>
