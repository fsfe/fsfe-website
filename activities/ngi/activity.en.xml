      The FSFE is a partner organisation of NGI, a coalition of various
      not-for-profit organisations from across Europe. Funded by the
      European Commmission, NGI provides grants to individual
      researchers and developers, as well as teams that wish to work on
      new ideas and technologies that contribute to the establishment
      of the Next Generation Internet. The FSFE provides legal support
      for projects that improve openness, inclusivity, transparency,
      privacy, cooperation, and protection of data.
