	"Microsoft can consider itself above the law no longer," says Georg
	Greve, president of the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE).
	"Through tactics that successfully derailed antitrust processes in
	other parts of the world, including the United States, Microsoft has
	managed to postpone this day for almost a decade. But thanks to the
	perseverance and excellent work of the European Commission, these
	tactics have now failed in Europe."
