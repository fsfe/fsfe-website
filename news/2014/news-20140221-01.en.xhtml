<p newsteaser="yes">Like in the last years on February 14th, people all 
around the world expressed their gratitude and appreciation not only to 
their partner but also to Free Software and its contributors. We asked you 
to thank your favourite developers and projects and were overwhelmed by the 
resonance in blogs, social networks and mailing lists.</p>

<p>Developers and contributors of Free Software projects work hard to ensure 
our freedom and on this day surely many of them gained new motivation. Thank 
you for participating in this year's #ilovefs campaign and enjoy some of the 
many love declarations we collected:</p>

<h3>#ilovefs is crossing borders</h3>

<p>One speciality of #ilovefs is the broadband of people expressing their 
love for Free Software. Year after year we recognise that Free Software is 
not only a topic for programmers and professional users but for many groups 
of people: the average computer users, artists, journalists, companies, and 
among them also politicians. This year the parliamentary group of the Green 
party in Germany wrote how important Free Software is in times of global 
surveillance and in general. And as a small extra they also sent a nice 
picture, which deserves much respect considering the stressful schedule of 
politicians.</p>
