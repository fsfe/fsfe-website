<p>The European Legal Network is a private network of legal professionals
  facilitated by the FTF. Members share knowledge and cooperate to increase the
  availability of best practice information about Free Software licensing. The network has over 200 participants across 27 countries and 4 continents, and today is the largest legal support structure for Free Software in the world.</p>

<p>As part of our facilitation role we can help locate legal experts in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Greece, Germany, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands and the UK. We also maintain contacts in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the USA.</p>

<p>If you are a legal expert interested in participating in the European Legal Network please <a href="contact.html">let us know</a>. We are particularly interested in getting to know experts in countries that recently joined the EU,  in the Baltic states, and across Asia.</p>
