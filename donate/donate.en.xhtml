      <p>
        The Free Software Foundation Europe is a non-profit non-governmental
        organisation. <a href="/work.html">Our work</a> is made
        possible by a community of
        <a href="/contribute/contribute.html">volunteers</a>,
        <a href="thankgnus.html">supporters and donors</a>. Your donations are
        critical to our strength and autonomy. They enable us to continue
        working for Free Software wherever necessary, and to be an independent
        voice.
      </p>

    <h2>Ways of donating</h2>

    <h3>Become a supporter</h3>

    <p>
      The recommended way for donating to us is to become a supporter by
      periodically contributing either 10 Euro or more monthly, or 60 Euro or
      more yearly.

    </p>

    <h3>Make a one-time donation</h3>

    <p>
      In case you just want to make a single payment with any amount of
      your choice, this is the right option for you.

    <h2>What happens next</h2>

    <p>
      If you donate more than 480 Euro in a year, we would like to add your
      name to our <a href="thankgnus.html">donors list</a>. You can
      also remain anonymous.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, you can include our
      <a href="/about/graphics/sponsoring/sponsoring.html">Sponsoring buttons</a>
      on your own web page to show your support for us.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tax-deduction">Tax deduction</h2>

    <p>
      In some countries, donations to us can be deducted from income tax.
      Currently, this is the case in <a href="germany.html">Germany</a>, the
      <a href="netherlands.html">Netherlands</a>, and
      <a href="switzerland.html">Switzerland</a>. A donation receipt
      is generally sent in the beginning of the year for donations
      received the previous year.
