      <p>To celebrate I Love Free Software Day 2026 in Rotterdam, we will be gathering at <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/12942109501#map=19/51.917236/4.464462">Snackbar Frieda (Bajonetstraat 49 3014 ZC)</a> and participate in the workshop “Knitting Our Internet”. When? On the 13. February at 18:00 (local time).</p>
     <p>Knitting Our Internet is an interactive journey through the history of the Internet, and a collective rethinking of its future.</p>
     <p>The activity consists of a face-to-face workshop, providing tangible and simple examples about how the Internet works, simultaneously questioning the very essence of today’s mainstream social networks. Its main purpose is to expose the critical limits of surveillance capitalism, centralization, and its environmental impact.</p>
     <p>After acknowledging the challenges the digital domain is currently facing, participants are encouraged to reinterpret social networks starting from decentralization, envisioning more human, collective, and participatory digital futures.</p>
