        What would you think about a sign on the highway saying “You
        need a Volkswagen to drive on this road. Contact your
        Volkswagen dealer for a gratis test drive – Your Government”?
        When it comes to software that opens PDF files, many public
        sector organizations do this every day. With
        the pdfreaders.org campaign we have turned the spotlight on government
        organizations who behave in this way, exposing how frequent
        such advertisements for non-free software are. With the help
        of activists across Europe, we will contact these
        organisations and explain to them how to improve their
        websites so that they respect our freedom.

    <h2>What was already achieved</h2>

    <p>
      Every day, public institutions advertise non-free software on their
websites. Some examples are below. With the help of
our <a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org/">Fellows</a> and of hundreds other Free Software activists, we have collected over one month 2286 bug reports coming from every countries in Europe, and
also nine countries outside of Europe.

    <p>
Our <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/petition.html">Petition For The Removal 
Of Proprietary Software Advertising On Public Institution Websites</a> was  
signed by 38 organizations, 46 businesses and 
1482 individuals. If you haven't signed it
yet, <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/petition.html">do it now</a>!
    </p>

    <h2>Second phase of the campaign: Contacting the public sector</h2>

<p>Finding public bodies that advertise proprietary PDF readers was
  only the first step of the campaign. Now we need to build awareness for the following issues:</p>

<ul><li><p><strong>A question of neutrality:</strong> Public institutions should not engage in advertising</p>

<p>By recommending a single non-free program, public institutions are
  promoting the proprietary software model. There
  are <a href="http://pdfreaders.org">loads of alternatives</a> to the
  reader they promote, so there is no reason for public institutions
  to further strengthen the dominance of a single company over a part
  of the software market. Advertisements on public sector websites may
  be fine if they're marked as such and paid for, and if they don't
  endanger competition and choice in the software market. When public
  bodies act as a marketing channel for a single company's product,
  something has gone wrong.
 </p></li>

<li><p><strong>A question of freedom:</strong> Public institutions should not ask citizens to use non-free software.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html">Free
    Software</a> is software that anyone can use, study, share and
  improve. These four freedoms give users the full control over the
    software they use. Free Software makes sure you don't have to buy
    a company's product if you just want to read documents
    that other people send you, including public bodies. Any program
    can be checked for security holes, so that problems often get
    fixed quickly. Free Software helps protect your privacy, because you can be sure that the
    program you're using only does the things you want, and nothing
    more. A government that exists to protect and preserve our freedom
    should not be asking us to use non-free software.
</p></li>


<li><p><strong>A question of <a href="/projects/os/def.html">Open Standards</a></strong>: </p>
<p>The versions of the PDF format which are <a href="/projects/os/def.html">Open Standards</a> can be
  implemented by all PDF readers. If public bodies don't stick to Open
  Standards when generating their documents, they make it harder for
  Free Software offerings and different vendors to compete in the market.</p>

<p>For all of these reasons, FSFE is asking public administrations to
  either remove their advertising for proprietary software or at least
  run equal advertising for Free Software, so that users of their
  websites realise that they have a choice.</p></li></ul>
