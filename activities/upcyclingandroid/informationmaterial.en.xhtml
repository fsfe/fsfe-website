    <h3>About Upcycling Android</h3>

      <p class="infodescription">
         Every year, 1.5 billion smartphones are manufactured worldwide - and probably just as many are thrown away. Most of them after way too short usage times. E-waste increases every year. The production of devices requires a lot of energy and natural resources. With Upcycling Android we try to fix that problem - for Android devices in particular!<br/>Our video explains the problem in a nutshell and shows how to overcome software obsolescence and help save the climate at the same time. Enjoy and share it with your friends! Watch it <a href="FIXME">on Peertube</a> or <a href="FIXME">on Youtube</a></p>

    <h3>F-Droid: Pimp your Android(-fork) with the best Free Software apps </h3>

      <p class="infodescription">
         After a short introduction about software freedom on Android and Custom ROMs, Erik Albers  demonstrates the Free-Software-App-Repository "F-Droid" with its decentralised and anti-censorship features. But as F-Droid offers you access to hundreds of Free-Software-apps and the sheer amount can be overwhelming in the beginning, in a next step Erik comes up with the most important apps (in his opinion) you should be aware of to get started.

Finally it gives an overview of what is happening now around microG and what is planned to happen short- and longterm.

      <p class="infodescription">
         Erik Albers gives a talk on the sustainability of software and Free Software. The talk discusses how and where sustainable management and consumption of software as a resource is in many ways contrary to the sustainable consumption of natural resources. And how we can take advantage of these characteristics to make software sustainable and thus to preserve it for the future.

      <p class="infodescription">
         The study starts with definition of software sustainability and its characteristics. It shows how the inherent characteristics of Free Software are sustainable as well as their impact on IT infrastructures. Software obsolescence is explained and the possibilities of using Free Software to save natural resources by extending hardware usage lifetime and through energy consumption savings. Finally, five politically necessary directives for a more sustainable digital society are outlined. Read the <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">full study</a>.
