	  <title>Zurich Fellowship meeting</title>
    <body>
	    There will be a Fellowship meeting at the FSFE Zurich office from 18:00 until 19:30 on Friday the 18th of July.  Some free (as in beer) beer will be provided and all Fellows nearby are invited to attend.  It will be a good chance to get to know each other in person, to discuss ways of spreading the word about Free Software in Switzerland, and to generally have a good time.  This meeting will be hosted by Shane Coughlan, the coordinator of FSFE's legal activities.  However, he promises not to talk about licences unless someone asks.  If you are coming to the meeting please let Shane know by sending an email to coughlan@fsfeurope.org.
