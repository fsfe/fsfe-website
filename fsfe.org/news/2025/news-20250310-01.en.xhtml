<h1>FSFE symposium: Public Money? Public Code! in practice</h1>

<p>
Free Software is indispensable for public authorities to overcome
dependencies and achieve technological sovereignty. Therefore, the need
of the hour is "Public Money? Public Code!" The Free Software Foundation
Europe's symposium in Essen on 08 April 2025 will open up practical
perspectives on how administrations can move forward in this
direction.

<p>Together with representatives from politics, public administration,
business, academia and civil society, we want to discuss the benefits of
Free Software for public institutions at local, state and federal level,
and the challenges that arise along the way. The focus will be on the
use of Free Software in municipalities: Where do best practices already
exist and what can we learn from them? What can municipal Free Software
governance look like? What opportunities does Free Software offer for
collaboration? What needs to be considered during procurement?</p>

<p>The symposium "Public Money? Public Code! in practice" is organised
by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE). It is primarily aimed at
decision-makers, procurers and multipliers from public administrations
in Germany as well as people who are involved in the digitisation of
public administration in their day-to-day work.</p>

<p>The event will be held in German. Participation is free of charge,
but online registration is required (registration deadline 23 March
2025). The number of participants is limited, a confirmation of
participation will be sent on 25 March 2025. The <a
href="/about/codeofconduct.html">FSFE Code of
Conduct</a> applies.</p>

<p>We look forward to your registration!</p>

<h3 id="free-software-and-public-money-public-code"><span id="anchor"></span>Free Software and "Public Money? Public Code!"</h3>
<p>Free Software gives everyone the right to use, study, share, and
improve applications for any purpose. These four freedoms ensure that
similar applications do not have to be programmed from scratch every
time and, thanks to transparent processes, others do not have to
reinvent the wheel. In large projects, expertise and costs can be shared
and applications are available to all. This promotes innovation and
saves taxpayers money in the future. Dependencies on vendors are
minimised and security issues can be fixed more easily. The Free
Software Foundation Europe, together with over 200 organisations and
administrations, is therefore calling for “Public Money? Public Code!” -
If it is public money, it should be public code as well! More
information on the initiative is available on the "<a 
href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money? Public Code!"
website</a>.</p>
