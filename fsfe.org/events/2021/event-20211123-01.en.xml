    <body>
      <p>The monthly meeting of the FSFE Women is fast approaching. Our next meeting will take place on the 23rd of November at 7:30 pm (CET). The FSFE Women meet once in a month to discuss topics related to Free Software, IT and about any aspects of being a women* in tech. For our upcoming meeting we will continue working on our logo and look at some drafts Marlene has created for us. Please be aware that this group is women-centric and transgender and non-binary friendly. If you identify as a man, we kindly ask you to reach out to the coordinators of the FSFE Women to let them know you would like to join. For more information about the FSFE Women have a look at our <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Women">team site</a>. The group is open for all women* who are interested in Free Software.</p>
