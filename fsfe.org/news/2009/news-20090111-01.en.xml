    <body>
      <p>FSFE's new year translation sprint ended yesterday with a respectable
      result: the numerous volunteers created 49 new translations and updated
      137 documents within 28 days.</p>
      <p>FSFE's core team expresses its appreciation towards all the volunteers
      who contributed.  You have helped a great deal by making information
      about Free Software and FSFE's activities available in local European
      languages.</p>
