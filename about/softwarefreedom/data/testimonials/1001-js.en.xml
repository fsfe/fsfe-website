    “40 years ago, a group of hackers came together to do what seemed impossible -- write
	a fully free operating system that gave users full control over their computers. They
	proved that it could be done, by doing it.
	
	Everyone feeling hopelessness about the state of modern computing -- mobile
	surveillance devices in our pockets, black-box AI threatening the fabric of society,
	streaming and publishing companies trying to claim all human culture and knowledge as
	their own by virtue of their control over the digital distribution platforms -- should look
	to the example of GNU's origin to know that we *can* actually get out from under this,
	if we come together in support of each other and do our best to reject what's being
	forced on us.“
