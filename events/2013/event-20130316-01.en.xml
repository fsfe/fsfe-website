	<p>The "Chemnitz Linux Days" is a conference that deals with GNU/Linux and Free Software.  It is open for everyone, novizes and experts alike. The FSFE will be presented with a booth where you can inform yourself about our work and to get to know the people behind FSFE. Another way of presentation are two talks which will be given by Matthias Kirschner and Erik Albers.
