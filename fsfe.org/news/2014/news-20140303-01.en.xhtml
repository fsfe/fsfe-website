  <h2>Election results</h2>

  <p>
  …Stefan "Penny" Harmuth! The election period for this year's Fellowship
  GA seat has ended on February 28. There was just one candidate running for the Fellowship GA seat this time. The more we are happy that still 20,3% of our Fellows took their chance to support Stefan Harmuth in his run for the seat. </p>

  <p>
    Thanks to all Fellows who participated and congratulations to Stefan!
