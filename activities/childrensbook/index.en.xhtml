  <h2>About the book</h2>

  <blockquote><p>The famous inventor Zangemann lives in a huge villa high above
  the city. Adults and children alike love his inventions and are desperate to
  have them. But then something happens: when Zangemann wants to take another
  close-up look at his inventions during a walk through the city, a child hits
  him in the shin with the skateboard. That hurts! Enraged, the inventor makes
  a momentous decision... The clever girl Ada sees through what is going on.
  Together with her friends, she forges a plan.</p>

  <p>This illustrated book tells the story of the famous inventor Zangemann and
  the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment with hardware and
  software, and in the process realises how crucial it is for her and others to
  control technology.</p>

  <p>A book that arouses children's interest in tinkering and encourages
  shaping technology. From age 6 to 106.</p></blockquote>

  <blockquote>

  <p>"A rousing tale of self-reliance, community, and standing up
  to bullies...software freedom is human freedom!" - <em>Cory Doctorow, Sci-Fi
  Author</em></p>

  <p>"Introduces readers young and old to the power and peril of
  software. Behind it all is a backdrop of ethics of knowledge sharing upon
  which the arc of human history rides." - <em>Vint Cerf, Computer Scientist and One
  of the Inventors of the Internet</em></p>

  <p>"The book is a motivation for the first demo and a little bit
  of civil disobedience.  It is a utopia of possibilities to make the world
  better with limited means and little money, and an example without moralistic
  finger-pointing, that control does not make happy." - <em>Anna Biselli,
  Editor-in-Chief Netzpolitik.org</em></p>

  <p>"Together with illustrator Sandra Brandstätter, the author has
  succeeded in creating a technoid fairy tale with a contemporary moral" -
  <em>Basler Zeitung</em></p>

  <p>"Even as a non-child, I was captivated by the story from the
  first page to the last. Kudos to the author for packaging difficult topics
  such as monopolies, lobbyism, digital divide, software freedom, digital
  autonomy, IoT, consumer control, e-waste and much more in a child-friendly
  form in an easily understandable and exciting storyline." - <em>Jörg Luther,
  chief editor of the German Linux-Magazin, LinuxUser, Raspberry Pi Geek</em>
  </p>

  <p>"The IT fairy tale we need" - <em>Golem.de</em></p>

  <h2>How to learn coding?</h2>

  <p>There are many resources out which help young people to learn programming.
  Our community is gathering more information about that topic on our <a
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/action/edit/Activities/ProgrammingForChildren">wiki
  page</a>, and we invite you to help us with amending and keeping this
  up-to-date.</p>

  <h2>Let's draw</h2>

  <p>We provide some drawing templates for children. You can download the <a
  href="/activities/childrensbook/ada-drawing-template.en.pdf">PDF file</a> and
  print out the pages you like.</p>

  <p>We would love to publish pictures of paintings or other things that
  children created about the book. In case your child painted an own version of
  Ada or Zangemann, a modified skateboard, how they imagine software, or how
  computer who print ice cream could look like in future. Please <a
  href="mailto:contact@fsfe.org?subject=Ada and Zangemann">e-mail them to us
  </a> including the permission for us to publish them under either CC-0 or

<h2>Get active</h2>

<p>
  Would you like to raise awareness for software freedom? If you liked 
  the book, here are some ideas.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Suggest</strong> the book to your public library. Often you 
    can recommend new books to libraries.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Donate</strong> the book to a public library. This is a 
    good option for cases when a library does not have the budget to 
    buy the book, but you can afford it. Your copy will make many 
    people happy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give your <strong>feedback</strong> to bookstores about the book, 
    so they recommend it to others.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a <strong>review</strong> if you bought the book online. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Offer schools, youth clubs or elderly homes to <strong>read the 
    book</strong> there. They often ask for people reading books and it 
    is a good way to talk about software freedom. <a href="https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/ada-zangemann/src/branch/main/Presentations">These 
    slides</a> can be used as a background while you read with a 
    projector.

</ul>
