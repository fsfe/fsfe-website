<h1>Legal Corner +++ CRA +++ Public Awareness</h1>

<p>Last month we published a new article in our Legal Corner, we checked
how the German government is doing after 100 days, and we provided a deeper look at the
CRA on our podcast. We also attended several conferences and continue
working on making gatekeepers accountable under the DMA.</p>

<h3 id="quote-of-the-month">Quote of the Month</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>"Free Software should be celebrated and appreciated just as much as
		the concepts of democracy, the rule of law, equal opportunities, and
		the free exchange of other information than just Software! [I Love 
		Free Software Day] is a great way to remind people that
		lots of community spirit has gone into creating the tools we use
		every, which is often more and more powered by 
		software".</p><cite>Steven Maddox from FSFE Potteries group-</cite>

<h3 id="legal-corner">Legal Corner: Bringing SumUp to compliance: a case
study of license enforcement</h3>
<p>What happens when those who benefit from the four freedoms fail to
comply with the terms of a Free Software license? We take a look
at the experience of license enforcement by one of our FSFE volunteers
against the fintech company SumUp, and examine the lessons that
supporters of Free Software can take away from it. <a 
href="/news/2025/news-20250820-01.html">Read it now!</a> </p>

<h3 id="sfp">SFP#37: Policy and EU: The most famous of them all
– we are talking about the CRA</h3>
<p>Most of you have heard of the famous Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), 
legislation introducing CE labels for digital products. In our latest
episode of the Software Freedom Podcast, <a 
href="/news/podcast/episode-37.html">Bonnie and Alex have an easy to
follow conversation about the CRA and what will be happening next</a>. </p>

<h3 id="policy">After 100 days: Germany’s government still lacks a
Free Software push</h3>
<p>On 14 August 2025, Germany’s government marked 100 days in office.
CDU, CSU, and SPD had pledged ambitious Free Software goals. Yet <a 
href="/news/2025/news-20250814-01.html">it
remains unclear what these goals actually are, how they will be
achieved, and what role Free Software will play</a> in securing Germany’s
technological sovereignty. </p>

<h3 id="ilovefs">ilovefs: How "I Love
Free Software Day" is celebrated in Potteries, UK </h3>

<p>Every year on 14 February we celebrate our "I Love Free Software
Day". On this day we thank all Free Software contributors for their
commitment to use, study, share, and improve Free Software. We have
<a href=">/news/2025/news-20250828-01.html">talked with our local group 
in Potteries (UK) to learn a bit more about
them and how they celebrate this day</a>.</p>

<h3 id="conferences">At the stages: FrOSCon, Scambi Festival, COSCUP...</h3>

<p>In August we travelled to Sankt Augustin to attend
FrOSCon once again. The day before, our local group there held a community
meetup in Bonn, attended by around 30 people. And during the two day
conference, we had a booth (thanks to our volunteers for giving a hand
there!) and two talks: one analysing the first <a
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/b9Gm9cn3rYgPxLBuYtF2zg">100 days of the
current German government</a> and another one discussing the <a
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/miJY9odhtHi6Q8Zpz8SGca">current state of
the CRA implementation</a>.</p>

<p>The city of Sanremo also welcomed us for the Scambi Festival in which
we had an “Ada &amp; Zangemann” reading and a workshop about Free Software
basics. We also had the chance to gift a 'Ada &amp; Zangemann' book to
the town public library, which was accepted by the Deputy Mayor of
Culture of Sanremo.</p>

<p>And we also travelled to Taiwan! At this year's 20th anniversary of
COSCUP, the FSFE was present with a booth and several talks!</p>

<p>In September we hope to see you at InselChaos and at Vegamania in
Vienna!</p>

<h3 id="support">Big Tech
greed is here. Software freedom needs you!</h3>
<p> A few weeks ago we sent you an email about how software freedom
needs your support as currently owning a mobile device is not the same
as controlling it. Apple and Google, which the EU considers gatekeepers
under the Digital Markets Act, have created tightly controlled
ecosystems that limit software freedom and shut out competition. We want
them to change this kind of behaviour!</p>

<p>Join us today as <a href="/donate/donate.html">an FSFE supporter and be part of the movement fighting
for your right to control your own device</a>. </p>

<p>Besides, we are still gathering feedback from Free Software
developers with our <a 
href="/activities/deviceneutrality/interop-survey">Digital Markets Act 
Interoperability Survey</a>. We need your feedback about requesting
software interoperability.
</p>
