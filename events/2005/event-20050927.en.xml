FSFE's president Georg Greve has been invited to speak at the Latin American and Caribbean Conference on Development and Use of Free Software. He will talk about Free Software as a social movement and its interaction in the political field, in particular on United Nations level, such as WIPO. Georg Greve is also looking forward to a session on the Free Software Foundations with participants from FSF Latin America, FSF India and FSF Europe. During this event he will share with the audience some of the work that FSFE has done in the past years.
