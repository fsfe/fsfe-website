    <title>"Ask your candidates" - German Federal Election 2009</title>
    <description>
	During the German federal elections in 2009, FSFE called on all German Free
	Software supporters to ask the parties' candidates about their positions on
	Free Software and Open Standards. FSFE set up a <a
		href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Bundestagswahl2009">page about the German
		Bundestagswahl</a> to help asking questions, and to collecting
	answers.
