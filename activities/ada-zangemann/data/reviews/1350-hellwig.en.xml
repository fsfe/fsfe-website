    "Ada &amp; Zangemann tells an exciting story that will delight children and
    adults alike. IT describes the problems of the current tech oligopolies and
    how people can overcome them if they stick together and dare. The text is
    ingeniously complemented by the illustrations, which almost pass for a
    hidden object book."
