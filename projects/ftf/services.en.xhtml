<h3>Administrative Support</h3>

<h3>Training and Consultancy</h3>

<p>We provide <a href="/projects/ftf/education.html">training and consultancy</a> on Free Software licensing and the strategic implementation of Free Software in business.</p>

<h3>Public Speaking</h3>

<p>FTF representatives speak on Free Software licensing best practice, the implementation of Free Software by businesses, and project management. For more information or to arrange for one of our representatives to speak at your event please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3>License Compliance</h3>

<p>We work in partnership with <a href="http://gpl-violations.org"
                                  target="_blank">gpl-violations.org</a> to
  resolve licensing issues for the long-term benefit of Free Software.  If you
  have a licensing issue you want to report, please follow these <a href="reporting-fixing-violations.de.html">guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Fidiciary License Agreement (FLA)</h3>

<p>We help projects adopt the <a href="fla.html">Fiduciary License Agreement</a>.  The FLA allows one entity to safeguard all of the code created for a project by consolidating copyright (or exclusive exploitation rights) to counteract copyright fragmentation.</p>

<h3>Fiduciary Programme</h3>

<p>The <a href="fiduciary.html">FSFE Fiduciary Programme</a> allows projects to use the FLA to assign copyright for their code to FSFE, so that they can take care of writing code, while legal issues are dealt with by the FTF. The programme is subject to stringent acceptance criteria.</p>
