        <title>FSFE Netherlands online get-together (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>On the 20th of January the FSFE Netherlands will have another localgroup meeting. Like last few times it will be held online, so that despite missing our regular physical meeting we keep in touch. The meeting will be from 20:00 until 21:00 CET on the conference server. It is usually quite 'gezellig' and so most stay until 22:30, but you can leave whenever you see fit. The meeting is open for everybody, and we'll switch to English if not everybody understands Dutch. To join the meeting please send an email to country coordinator Nico Rikken (nico[dot]rikken[at]fsfe[dot]org), he will send you the meeting link and access code.</p>
