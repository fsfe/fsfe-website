<!-- For translators: Have a look at the previous years' campaigns. The
IloveFS pages normally don't change that much and you probably can
reuse many parts of them -->

<p>We should not underestimate the power of a simple "thank you" to 
motivate Free Software contributors in their important work for 
society. The 14th of February (a Wednesday this year) is the ideal day to 
do that.</p>

<p>In the Free Software society we exchange a lot of criticism. We write bug 
reports, tell others how they can improve the software, ask them for new 
features, and generally are not shy about criticising others. There is nothing 
wrong about that. It helps us to constantly improve. But sometimes we forget to 
show the hardworking people behind the software our appreciation.</p>

<h2>Show your love for Free Software</h2>

    <p>Many people are in love with Free Software for different reasons (<a href="/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.html">full gallery</a>)</p>

<p>Free Software drives a huge number of devices in our everyday life. It ensures 
our freedom, our security, civil rights, and privacy. It enables everyone to 
participate in a fair society. But as with people, everybody has different 
reasons to love Free Software. Let's show this variety to the world!</p>

<p>As the traditional day to show one's appreciation to people, Valentine's Day 
is the perfect opportunity to say <strong>thank you</strong> to the 
contributors of the various Free Software you love: developers, translators, 
designers, testers, or documentation writers, of huge softwares or smaller 
projects. All of them work on the Free Software ecosystem which we can enjoy 
every day.</p>

<h2>Be part of #ilovefs</h2>

<p>It doesn't matter who and where you are and what you do – everyone can 
participate at the "I love Free Software" day in many different ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thank your favourite contributors for their work in an individual way. 
  For example by sending one of <a 
  href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#ilovefs-postcard">our 
  postcards</a>.</li>

  <div class="captioned right" style="max-width: 506px; width: 30%;">
    <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#ilovefs">
      <img src="/contribute/promopics/ilovefs-postcard-front-thumb.png" alt="our postcard with the text: I love Free Software - but I love you more" />
    </a>
    <footer>
      <p>#ilovefs postcard</p>
    </footer>
  </div>

  <li>Show your appreciation publicly using social networks or your blog to 
  demonstrate the world how many people love Free Software – and thereby 
  motivate others to do the same. Just use the hashtag 
  <strong>#ilovefs</strong> on <a href="http://gnu.io/">GnuSocial</a>, <a 
  href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ilovefs">Twitter</a>, or other 
  platforms.</li>
</ul>

<p>If everybody contributes a small part we can enjoy a beautiful "I love Free 
Software" day together. Let's share videos and pictures, send postcards, tweets and blog 
posts, and show our love individually. Happy I love Free Software day 
everyone!</p>
