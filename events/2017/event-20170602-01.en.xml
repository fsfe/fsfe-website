			<p>Use. Study. Share. Improve. Software that gives us these Freedoms allows a more meaningful interaction with our computers and - more importantly - with our fellow human beings.	What makes Free Software so fascinating and how Free Software may make the world a better place, the FSFE Fellowship Muich tries to convey in a workshop on Friday, June 2nd 2017 (starting 18:00) at WikiMUC; Angertorstr. 3; Munich. There is no previous knowledge required and people who consider themselves not that technically inclined are escpecially welcome. We are looking forward to seeing you!
