    <body>
      <p>
Kern Sibbald, the founder and lead developer of the Bacula network
backup solution, assigned his copyright to FSFE.  "I wanted to
underline the commitment of the Bacula Project to Free Software," said
Kern.  "Bacula has always been a community project and we're just
solidifying that for the long-term. I am very thankful that the FSFE
is providing this service because it removes an important administrative
burden from the project, which allows us to focus on the task of
programming."
