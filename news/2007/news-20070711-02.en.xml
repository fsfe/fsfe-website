    <title>BBC: Questions for Microsoft on open formats</title>
    <body>
      <p>
Featured article by <a href="/about/people/greve">Georg Greve</a> and <a href="/about/jakobs/">Joachim Jakobs</a>
about the need for Open Standards in archival, and why using MS-OOXML risks future data loss: 
"Digital information could potentially be stored without loss of quality for a very long time to come.
But without knowledge about the encoding, our documents will become a meaningless series of ones and zeroes to future generations, just like cave paintings are too often meaningless bits of colour on stone to us."
