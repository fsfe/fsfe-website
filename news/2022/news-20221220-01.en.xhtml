<h2>About the FSFE</h2>

<p>
  Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to control
  technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives and it is
  important that technology empowers rather than restricts us. <a
  href="/freesoftware/">Free Software</a> gives everybody the rights to use,
  understand, share, and improve software. These rights help support other
  fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press, and privacy.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free Software
  contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination. We enhance
  users' rights by abolishing barriers to Free Software adoption, encourage
  people to use and develop Free Software, and provide resources to enable
  everyone to further promote Free Software in Europe.
</p>

<p>
  We are involved in <a href="/activities/">many activities</a> in the
  legal, economic, political and technical areas around Free Software.
  Our work is made possible by a community of volunteers, supporters,
  donors, and staff.
