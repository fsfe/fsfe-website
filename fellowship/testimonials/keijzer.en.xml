            I joined the Fellowship to stop being 'a minority of one', as 
            George Orwell once put it. I wanted to meet people who shared my ideals 
            and beliefs, so it would no longer feel as if I was fighting the system 
            all by myself. It's reassuring to know that you're not alone, 
            which probably motivates people to keep up with the work they are 
            doing, even if it's not always as successful as they would like it 
            to be.
