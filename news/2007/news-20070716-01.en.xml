FSFE Guest Commentary on Heise.de: "Conversion between Microsoft's
Office OpenXML (MS-OOXML) and the vendor-independent Open Document
Format (ODF) has been proposed by Microsoft and its associates as a
solution to the problems caused by Microsoft's efforts to push a
format into the market that conflicts with the existing Open
Standard. [...] If these converters were actually able to do what they
promise to do, they would be unnecessary."
