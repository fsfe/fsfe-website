        <title>FSFE Women group meeting (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>FSFE Women is a group for women* who are interested in Free Software. We get together about once in a month online to meet, give talks about topics we find interesting in the area of Free Software and discuss recent developments. The group is women-centric and open to all women, inter, trans and non-binary people. </p>
      <p>The meeting is in English. We start at 8:00 pm CET and usually stay together for ~ 2 hours. Here you can find the time in <a href="https://notime.zone/NNSLrTcGsmN9A">other timezones</a>. You are welcome to join in our <a href="https://conf.fsfe.org/b/women">BBB-Room</a> where we always meet. </p>
