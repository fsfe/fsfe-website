<h1>EU cuts funding for FS +++ Router Freedom +++ SFP</h1>

<p> The EC is planning to cut its funding to 
NGI projects, while in Belgium a court has supported end-users’  
Router Freedom rights. We also submitted feedback on the NIS2 
implementation; learnt about Linqa, a Free Software platform developed 
with public money; and gathered with volunteers at the Summer Meeting. 
Listen to our new SFP episode.</p>

<h3 id="NGI-funding">EC cuts funding support for Free Software 
projects</h3> 
<p>The Next Generation Internet initiative has supported 
Free Software projects with funding and technical assistance since 
2018. Despite its proven success, <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240719-01.html">the European Commission made the 
decision to cut this funding</a> in the current draft for the Horizon 
Europe 2025 Work Programme. This decision highlights the larger problem 
of the lack of motivated and sustainable public funding for Free 
Software projects.</p> 

<p>We therefore call for these funds to be made available again 
immediately and for funding to be secured in the medium to long term. 
This is the only way to successfully drive the digitalisation of Europe 
forward.</p> 

<h3 id="take-action">Take action! Ask EU representatives to fund Free Software</h3> 
<p>We need sustainable, secure, and 
dedicated funding for NGI and Free Software solutions that help Europe 
to control its technology!</p> 
<p>Help us to make our EU 
representatives aware of it! The budget decision is not yet official - 
so there is still a chance to allocate funds for NGI. It is therefore 
very important to contact <a 
href="https://commissioners.ec.europa.eu/ursula-von-der-leyen_de#paragraph_343">Ursula 
von der Leyen</a> (President of the EU 
Commission) and <a 
href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/write-us">DG Connect</a> 
to ask them to make the funds available. You 
can also contact your <a 
href="https://www.ideal-ist.eu/representatives">National Contact Point 
(NCP)</a> and persuade them to 
also advocate for the NGI funds to be made available.</p> 
<p>Another 
way is by supporting us with a donation so we can continue advocating for software freedom.</p>

<h3 id="NIS2">NIS2: Protecting the Free Software ecosystem in 
implementation</h3> 
<p>Together with NLnet Labs and the Open Source 
Security Foundation, <a href="/news/2024/news-20240715-01.html">the FSFE 
submitted feedback on the NIS2 Implementation Act</a>, pointing to the need 
to protect the European Free Software ecosystem.</p> 

<h3 id="router-freedom">Belgian court’s decision impacts the future of 
Router Freedom</h3> 
<p>A Belgian court has upheld the decision of the 
country’s regulator to introduce Router Freedom for fiber networks. The 
objections, raised by a local internet service provider, were deemed 
unfounded. This landmark decision represents a significant victory for 
consumer rights, and we urge other national regulators to follow this 
example.</p>

<figcaption>During the 2024 FSFE Summer Meeting, attendees had the chance to discuss together about the current status of EU policy in regards with Free Software. Volunteers had also the chance to solve their doubts as well as provide ideas about how to take part in it.</figcaption>

<h3 id="public-code">Linqa: a Free Software bilingual collaboration 
platform developed with public money</h3> 
<p>Linqa is a bilingual 
collaboration platform whose code is Free Software and was developed using 
public money. It helps the daily work of the Franco-German Forum for 
the Future, a public institution that fosters collaboration among 
actors in France and Germany. We dive into <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240726-01.html">the roots of Linqa with the 
people behind it</a>.</p>

<h3 id="SFP">SFP#25: MirageOS and OCaml with Hannes Mehnert and 
Matthias Kirschner</h3> 
<p>For <a 
href="/news/podcast/episode-25.html">our 25th episode of the Software Freedom 
Podcast</a> we are happy to welcome Hannes Mehnert, one of the MirageOS 
core developers. Matthias Kirschner, president of the FSFE, and Hannes 
talk about MirageOS. This episode gives an overview of everything from 
the basics to the future of MirageOS.</p>

	workshops, and of course a lot of fun. For the second year in a row, 
	the FSFE organised this meeting to inform our volunteers first-hand 
	about our activities and initiatives as well as to gather their 
	feedback and ideas.</figcaption>
