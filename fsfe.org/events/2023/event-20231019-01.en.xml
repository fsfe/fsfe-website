      <p>CRA and liability - what rules apply to Free Software - Alexander Sander (FSFE)<br/>
In the context of the Cyber Ressliance Act, the EU is currently discussing the introduction of liability rules for software, including Free Software. But what are the effects of these rules and what are the consequences for Free Software? The EU Commission has proposed an exemption to exclude Free Software "outside a commercial activity".  However, the wording leads to some problems and is therefore currently being improved by the Parliament and the Council. The talk will summarise the current state of the debate and show what consequences can be expected.</p>
