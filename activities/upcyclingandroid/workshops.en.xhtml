  <p>In collaboration with local partners and groups the FSFE runs "Upcycling Android" workshops to help you with the technical part of upgrading your default Android phone with a Custom ROM. You can read about how this works and why it helps on our <a href="upcycling">upcycle page</a></p>

  <p>Since we are working together with local gorups, any workshop is unique and different. They happen in different places and locations but they also put different focus each. Some focus on installing Android alternatives other might concentrate on installing full Linux replacements. But even within these categories they might differ in the actual operating system they concentrate on installing and offer help with. Please read the desctiptions carefully to be sure you choose the workshop that matches your interests. You find however some general remarks for all workshops below.</p>

  <h2 class="painted" id="about-the-workshops">General remarks on the workshops</h2>
