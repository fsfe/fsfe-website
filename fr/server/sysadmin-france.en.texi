@cindex shell account
@cindex fsffr and shell account

The user accounts on @code{fr.fsf.org} and @code{snail.gnu.org} are
managed with @uref{http://savannah.gnu.org/,,Savannah}. If someone
need a shell account on @code{fr.fsf.org} or @code{snail.gnu.org} she
has to get an account on @uref{http://savannah.gnu.org/,,Savannah}
first. Then she should send a mail to one of the project
administrators of the
@uref{http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/fsffr/,,fsffr} project. The
project administrator adds her as a member of the
@uref{http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/fsffr/,,fsffr} project. Within
24 hours a cron job on @code{fr.fsf.org} and @code{snail.gnu.org} will
fetch the new user from Savannah and create the corresponding account.

Once the account is created, access to the machines is available using
ssh and a public key. The Savannah password will not work on
@code{fr.fsf.org} or @code{snail.gnu.org}. When logged on

Once a day the ssh public keys of every account on @code{fr.fsf.org}

Savannah. If the @file{authorized_keys} file of a user is manually
updated, it will be overwritten.

@node Account Delete, Account www on fr.fsf.org, Account Update, Machines Accounts
@section Account Delete

When a user is not listed anymore in the
@uref{http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/fsffr/,,fsffr}, its account is
disabled on @code{fr.fsf.org} and @code{snail.gnu.org}. The home
directory is not deleted and if the user is added again at a later
time, she will retrieve his former home directory.

@node Account www on fr.fsf.org, Cron Job, Account Delete, Machines Accounts
@section Account www on fr.fsf.org

Every account created automatically as described above is also granted
an access to the @code{www} user on @code{fr.fsf..org} (and not on
@code{snail.gnu.org}). @code{www} owns the directory in which all the
document roots of the apache server are : @file{/home/www}.

This is simply done by appending the public keys of all the users to the
@file{authorized_keys} file of the @code{www} user. 

@node Cron Job,  , Account www on fr.fsf.org, Machines Accounts
@section Cron Job

The @file{/usr/local/bin/savannahusers} script does the user account
updates. It is run from the @file{/etc/cron.d/savannahusers} cron file
and spits log information in @file{/var/log/savannahusers.log}. The
log file is rotated according to the
@file{/etc/logrotate.d/savannahusers} specification. This holds for
both @code{fr.fsf.org} and @code{snail.gnu.org}.

Savannah does not provide account information to non identified
machines. The @code{fr.fsf.org} and @code{snail.gnu.org} machines are
explicitly allowed to retrieve the relevant information. For more
information check the
@uref{http://savannah.gnu.org/savannah.html#Account%20Management,,Account
Management} chapter of the Savannah documentation.

The @file{savannahusers} script sources can be found in the
@uref{http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/www/,,www} project source tree.
It was checked out in @file{/usr/local/src/www} directory (on

logged permanently in @file{/var/log/screen}.

Although it is possible to talk to the switch or the powerboot without using
the screen session, this is strongly discouraged because no log of the commands
will be archived.

On all screen sessions, the escape character is C-\ instead of the default
C-a so that editing stuff with emacs is not a nightmare.

A list of active windows is displayed permanently at the bottom of the screen
session. 

Most commonly used screen commands:

@itemize @code

@item C-\ d 
exit from the screen session (does not destroy it).

@item C-\ 0
switch to terminal 0

@item C-\ 1
switch to terminal 1

@item C-\ 2
switch to terminal 2

@item C-\ 3
switch to terminal 3

@item C-\ c
create a new terminal with a shell inside, exiting the shell
will close the terminal.

@item C-\ ?
