<h2><a href="#" name="SECTION00010000000000000000">
Preamble</a>
</h2>

<p>
Upon entering the digital age, in which real and virtual space will
equally determine the social, cultural and scientific development of
mankind, the Free Software Foundation Europe has the long-term goal to
raise and work on the questions this will necessarily raise.
</p>
<p>
In this regard the direct function is the unselfish promotion of
Free Software as well as creating and propagating the awareness of the
related philosophical and social questions.
</p>
<p>
As its acknowledged sister organization, the FSFE will join
forces with the Free Software Foundation founded by Richard
M. Stallman in the United States of America. The latter, recognized
tax-exempt charitable organization in the USA, has been dedicating
itself since 1985 to the promotion and distribution of Free software
and in particular the GNU-System, a Unix-like operating system. This
system is mostly known by one of its variants, GNU/Linux, which since
1993 has been used successfully on many computers.
</p>
<p>
The term Free Software in the sense of the FSFE does not refer
to the price, but rather to the following four freedoms:
</p>
<ol>
<li>freedom: the freedom to use a program for any purpose
</li>
<li>freedom: the freedom to study the program and adapt it to your
own needs. 
</li>
<li>freedom: the freedom to make copies for others.
</li>
<li>freedom: the freedom to improve a program and make these
improvements available to others, so that the whole community
benefits. 
</li>
</ol>

<p>
This definition of Free Software goes back to the idea of freely
exchanging knowledge and ideas that can traditionally be found in
scientific fields. Like thoughts, software is non-tangible and
duplicable without loss. Passing feeds an evolutionary process,
advancing thoughts and software.
</p>
<p>
Only Free Software preserves the possibility to comprehend and build
upon scientific results. For scientists, it is the only kind of
software which corresponds to the ideals of a free
science. Accordingly, the promotion of free software is also a
promotion of science.
</p>
<p>
The distribution of information and the forming of an opinion are done
increasingly by digital media, and the trend is to foster the use of
those means for a direct citizen participation to
democracy. Therefore, a central task of the FSFE is to train
proficient citizens in these media, thereby promoting democracy.
</p>
<p>
Digital space (``Cyberspace''), with software as its medium and its
language has an enormous potential for the promotion of all mental and
cultural aspects of mankind. By making it commonly available and
opening up the medium, Free Software grants equal chances and
protection of privacy.
</p>
<p>
Coining the awareness for the problems related to the digital age in
all parts of society is long-term goal and a core aspect of the work
of the FSFE.
</p>
<p>
Therefore the FSFE will seek to increase the use of Free
Software in schools and universities in order to parallelize the
education in real space matters with the creation of understanding and
awareness of problems in virtual space.
</p>
<p>
Free Software guarantees traceable results and decision-making
processes in science and public life as well as the individual rights
to free development of personality and liberty of opinion. It is the
job of the FSFE to carry Free Software into all areas that touch
public life or ``informational human rights'' of citizens.

Membership Fees, Remuneration
</h2>

<p>


                (1)

may receive adequate remuneration and expense reimbursements for
their services performed for the association. The appropriateness
of such remuneration is determined by the overall financial
situation of the association and by the specific tasks that need
to be performed through the respective organ. Remuneration may not
exceed the usual remuneration paid for freelance enagagements for
similar services rendered to comparable, non tax-exempt
organisations, businesses, or governmental offices (for example
in the IT industry). The amounts for remuneration for such organs
are decided upon by the General Assembly.
</p>
<p>


                (3)

work performed for other non tax-exempt organisations, businesses,
or governmental offices (for example in the IT industry). The
exact terms for remuneration for members and non-members, the
actual amounts as well as all other conditions will be decided
upon through the General Assembly or its defined representative.

<h2><a href="#" name="SECTION00070000000000000000"></a><a href="#" name="sec:fellowshipseats"></a>

Fellowship seats
</h2>

<p>
Two seats in the General Assembly are up for election among Fellows of
the FSFE, with a Fellow being defined in <a href="#sec:fellowshipseats">[ref]</a>
(2.<a href="#orderlyfellow">[ref]</a>).
</p>
<p>


                (1) 
Fellowship seats in the General Assembly must be held by natural
persons, cannot be inherited and enjoy all rights and responsibilities
of regular members of the General Assembly.
</p>
<p>


                (2) <a href="#" name="seats"></a>Fellowships seats differ from regular seats in the following ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Each seat is subject to general election among all orderly Fellows of the FSFE;
</li>
<li>Elections for seats shall be held yearly in rotation;
</li>
<li>The term for each seat is two years;
</li>
<li><a href="#" name="orderlyfellow"></a> An orderly Fellow is a natural person who

<ul>
<li>is registered to the Fellowship programme with correct information;
</li>
<li>made their annual Fellowship contribution;
</li>
<li>maintains a current email address in the Fellowship forwarding.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All orderly Fellows who have been subscribed to the Fellowship
  programme for more than one year are elegible for election.
</li>
<li>The term begins with confirmation of the election results by the Fellowship coordinator.
</li>
<li>Membership in the General Assembly terminates

<ul>
<li>automatically upon conclusion of their two-year term;
</li>
<li>when a Fellow fails to meet the elegibility criteria defined above;
</li>
<li>according to the provisions defined in <a href="#sec:endofmembership">[ref]</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>


                (3) 
The following procedure applies for all elections of the Fellowship
and is done in accordance with the Schulze method for voting:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The election is called and run by the Fellowship coordinator,
  who is appointed by the General Assembly;
</li>
<li>Elections are called by signed email to the Fellows three months
  before the election date;
</li>
<li>Candidates are all Fellows elegible for election who have
  informed the Fellowship coordinator of their intention to stand for
  office at least two months before the election date;
</li>
<li>Each Fellow participating in the election shall submit a ballot
  ranking all Candidates.
</li>
<li>Not all Candidates need to be ranked. Ranked Candidates are
  considered preferred to all unranked Candidates. Voters may rank
  Candiates equally. Unranked Candidates are considered to be ranked
  equally with one another.
</li>
<li>From the list of Candiates, a list of pairwise defeats are generated:
  
<ol>
<li>Given two Candidates A and B, V(A,B) is the number of voters
    who prefer Candidate A over Candidate B.
</li>
<li>Candidate A defeats Candidate B, if V(A,B) is strictly greater
    than V(B,A).
  
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>From the list of pairwise defeats, a set of transitive defeats
  are generated:
  
<ol>
<li>Candidate A transitively defeats Candidate C if A defeats C or
    if there is some other Candidate B where A defeats B AND B
    transitively defeats C.
  
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A Schwartz set is constructed from the set of transitive defeats:
  
<ol>
<li>Candidate A is in the Schwartz set if for all Candiates B,
    either A transitively defeats B, or B does not transitively defeat
    A.
  
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If there are defeats between Candidates in the Schwartz set, we
  drop the weakest such defeats from the list of pairwise defeats, and
  return to step 6.
  
<ol>
<li>A defeat (A,X) is weaker than a defeat (B,Y) if V(A,X) is less
    than V(B,Y). Also, (A,X) is weaker than (B,Y) if V(A,X) is equal
    to V(B,Y) and V(X,A) is greater than V(Y,B).
</li>
<li>A weakest defeat is a defeat that has no other defeat weaker
    than it. There may be more than one such defeat.
  
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If there are no defeats within the Schwartz set, then the winner
  is chosen from the Candiates in the Schwartz set. If there is only
  one such Candidate, (s)he is the winner. If there are multiple
  Candidates, the winner is randomly chosen by lot.
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a href="#" name="SECTION00080000000000000000">
Structure of the association</a>
</h2>

<p>


                (1) 
The Free Software Foundation Europe forms a European federation
structure and is divided into national associations. Those are
associations with own juridical personality after the law on societies
of the European State for its area the association are active.  All
members of the national associations must also be members of the FSFE.  
</p>
<p>


                (2) 
In order to preserve the uniformity, the national associations have to
fulfill minimum requirements determined by the General Assembly, which
are written down in a constitution-template for national
associations. This applies with the exception of requirements that are
inadmissible according to the laws of the state in which the national
association is to be created. In this case the constitution is to be
modified so it reflects the intentions of the constitution-template
most closely. The constitution requires the acceptance by the
Executive Council before the national association becomes part of the
FSFE.
</p>
<p>


                (3) 
The finances of the national associations are determined by the
budgeting in accordance with <a href="#sec:ga">[ref]</a> of this statute.
</p>
<p>


                (4) 
The national associations can conclude contracts in their own name for
the fulfillment of local tasks, if the means are present for the
fulfilment of these contracts.  They can in no case enter obligations
for the FSFE.
</p>
<p>


                (5) 
The national associations can only enter into negotiations for issues
that are focussed around their region and only with public authorities
and organisations responsible for their respective areas.
</p>
<p>


                (6) 
The national associations are entitled and obliged to bear their own
name trough which the affiliation with the Free Software Foundation
Europe is expressed. This has to be done by adding the denomination
``Chapter'' with the name of the state in English to ``Free Software
Foundation Europe'' (``FSFE''). Additionally they can bear the name in
the national language.
</p>
<p>


                (7) 
The Executive Council is entitled to revoke the right for the national
association to use the name ''FSFE'' if the national association
violates this constitution or its own constitution. The national
association can appeal the decision at the General Assembly of the
members.  The appeal must be lodged within two weeks after
communication of the decision at the Executive Council. The Executive
Council has to call in a General Assembly within three months of
punctual insertion of the appointment, which can remedy or overrule
the decision of the Executive Council with a majority of three
quarters of the remaining members.

                (1) 
At least once a year, if possible in the first quarter, is the orderly
General Assembly to take place; if possible in one of the states, in
which a national association exists. It is called up in writing by the
President under adherence to one period of six weeks under indication
of the agenda. The period begins with the day following the sending of the
invitation letter. The invitation letter is to be considered delivered
to the member, if it is addressed to the last address or e-mail

three quarters of the members, the invitation period can be shortened
to three weeks.
</p>
<p>


                (2) 
The agenda is determined by the President. Each member can request a
supplement of the agenda in writing to the President until
