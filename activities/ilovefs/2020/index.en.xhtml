<p>We often underestimate the power of a simple <strong>Thank
You</strong>. Free Software contributors do important work for our
society and they deserve attention. The "I love Free Software Day" on
14 February (also known as Valentine's Day) is the perfect opportunity
for you to express your special gratitude.</p>

<p>In the Free Software community, we put a lot of pressure on project
maintainers. We write bug reports and demand new features from people
who often spend their sparse volunteer time on Free Software code,
translations, tests, or design. There is nothing wrong with that
because constructive feedback helps us to further improve. But it is
also important to show some appreciation!</p>

<p>The yearly "I love Free Software Day" allows you to make 14 February
a day full of positive, creative and lovely messages for the whole
community. Together, we can celebrate software freedom that empowers
us.</p>
