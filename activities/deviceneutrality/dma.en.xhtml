  <h1>Device Neutrality and the DMA</h1>

  <div>

    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
        Device Neutrality is the policy concept to regulate monopoly over
        devices and re-establish end-user control over their digital equipment.
        The Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulates the economic activity of large
        digital platforms and introduces Device Neutrality in the EU
        legislation.

    <h2>Digital Markets Act: an Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The <a
      href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">Digital
      Markets Act (DMA)</a> is an EU law approved in 2022 to regulate the
      economic activity of large digital platforms that act as "gatekeepers" in
      an attempt to create a fairer and more competitive market for online
      platforms in the EU. The DMA is an important advancement for setting
      several anti-monopoly obligations that impact software freedom,
      interoperability and control over personal data. The three principal
      elements of the DMA refers to the designation of gatekeepers, the list of
      dos and don'ts and the enforcement mechanisms.

    <h3>Who are the gatekeepers</h3>

    <p>
      The scope of the DMA does not cover all digital services in the markets,
      but only to those qualifying as 'core platform services' (CPSs) listed in
      Art. 2(2). These include online intermediation services, search engines,
      social networks, video sharing platforms, messaging apps, operating
      systems, web browsers, virtual assistants, cloud computing services and
      online advertising.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DMA constitutes asymmetric regulation. Its obligations do not apply to
      all tech companies, but only to those providers which have been designated
      as <i>gatekeepers</i>. Such designation is done by the European
      Commission based on a cumulative "three criteria test" listed in Art.3(1):
      Gatekeepers are those companies with "significant impact on the EU
      internal market", which "control an important gateway for business users
      to reach end-users", and enjoy an "entrenched and durable position in the
      market".
    </p>

    <p>
      The DMA presumes the three-criteria test is met when a provider of CPS is
      above some thresholds for a certain period (in general 3 years), which are
      lay down in Art. 3(2). The company should present an annual EU turnover ≥
      EUR 7.5 billion, or an average market capitalisation or equivalent fair
      market value ≥ EUR 75 billion and the CPS should be provided in at least 3
      Member States. For the provided CPS, a reach of more than 45 million
      monthly active end-users in the EU and ≥ 10,000 in the last financial
      year. The Commission can designate gatekeepers not necessarily that meet
      these requirements, but fall under the criteria of Art. 3(1).
    </p>


    <h3>Device Neutrality rules in the DMA</h3>

    <p>
      The two principal DMA objectives are promoting "contestability" and
      "fairness" in digital markets. These are specific legal terms. Since DMA
      concerns economic rights, it is a consumer protection legislation in a
      strict sense, but it contains rules that affect directly and indirectly
      end-users. For the DMA, "fairness" means the imbalance of power
      between gatekeepers and business users which confers a disproportionate
      advantage for the gatekeeper. On its turn, "contestability" aims to
      limit the monopolistic power of gatekeepers by allowing their
      disintermediation for better competition in the markets. For Device
      Neutrality both objectives mean that end-users have the right of access to
      alternative routes to market, and third party services and products (e.g.
      Free Software) should enjoy equitable treatment relative to the
      gatekeeper's services. In other words, gatekeepers should not restrict
      business and end-users from accessing rival routes to market for accessing
      content, software and other digital services.
    </p>

    <p>
      For each of the gatekeeper’s core platform services designated by the
      Commission, a set of "hard" and "soft" obligations are imposed in Arts.
      5-7, coupled with corrective mechanisms (Arts. 8-13). Provisions related
      to Device Neutrality are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Art. 5(3)</strong>: Gatekeepers cannot prohibit business users
        (e.g. app developers) to set different prices and conditions for their
        apps in alternative stores (e.g. F-Droid).
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Art. 5(4)</strong>: Gatekeepers cannot prohibit business users
        (e.g. app developers) to conclude contracts with consumers outside
        the gatekeeper' app store, so that they are not required to use the app
        store's payment system.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Art. 5(5)</strong>: Gatekeepers should allow end-users to access
        and use through a business user’s app (e.g. a third-party pp) any
        content, subscriptions, features or other functionalities, even when
        these have been acquired outside the gatekeeper’s CPSs (e.g. using a
        subscription acquired outside the gatekeeper's app).
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Art. 5(7)</strong>: Gatekeepers cannot require business users to
        subscribe to any other core platform service. For instance, gatekeepers
        cannot make access to their app stores conditional upon app developers
        integrating a "Sign in with ...." function into their apps.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Art. 5(8)</strong>: Gatekeepers cannot make business and
        end-users register or sign-in for a service or app conditional to other
        gatekeeper's service or app.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Art. 6(3)</strong>: Gatekeepers are requested to allow and
        technically enable end users to uninstall any pre-installed software in
        devices excluding those essential to the functioning of the operating
        system or device, and which cannot be offered by third parties on a
        standalone basis. Besides, gatekeepers must also allow and technically
        enable end-users to change those default settings on the operating
        system, as long as they do not endanger the integrity of its operating
        system or hardware.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Art. 6(4)</strong>: Gatekeepers are requested to allow and
        technically enable the installation and use of third-party apps or app
        stores on its operating system. They must allow these apps and app
        stores to be accessed via side-loading. Gatekeepers cannot prevent these
        third-party apps and app stores from prompting users to decide whether
        the downloaded app (store) should be the default. However, gatekeepers
        can take strictly necessary and proportionate measures to ensure that a
        third-party app (store) does not endanger the integrity of its operating
        system or hardware or to enable end-users to effectively enable
        security.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Art. 6(5)</strong>: Gatekeepers cannot prefer their own products
        and services more favourably in ranking and search results, or in their
        own app stores.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Art. 6(6)</strong>: Gatekeepers cannot restrict the ability of
        end-users to switch between and subscribe to different apps and services
        that are accessed via the operating system or app store.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Art. 6(7)</strong>: Gatekeepers should allow business users
        (service providers and hardware providers) free and effective
        interoperability with the same hardware and software features accessed
        or controlled via the operating system. However, gatekeepers can take
        strictly necessary and proportionate measures to ensure interoperability
        does not undermine the integrity of their operating system and hardware.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Art. 6(9)</strong>: Gatekeepers should provide end-users (and
        third parties authorized by end-users) with effective "real time data
        portability" (data interoperability) of data provided or generated by
        these end-users.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Art. 6(12)</strong>: Gatekeepers should provide business users
        (third party software developers) fair, reasonable and
        non-discriminatory access conditions to their app stores, search engines
        and operating systems.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Art. 7</strong>: Gatekeepers of messaging apps
        (number-independent interpersonal communication service in the language
        of the law) make basic functionalities of this service interoperable
        with other messaging apps from other providers by providing the
        necessary technical interfaces or similar solutions upon request and
        free of charge. This obligation has been further specified in the law:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Immediately after gatekeeper designation: End-to-end text messaging
            and the sharing of images, voice messages, videos and other attached
            files between two individual end users should be implemented
            immediately after the EC designating the gatekeeper.
          </li>

          <li>
            2 years of designation: End-to-end text messaging within groups of
            individual end users and the sharing of images, voice messages,
            videos and other attached files between a group chat and an
            individual end-user.
          </li>

          <li>
            Within 4 years of designation: End-to-end voice and video calls
            between two individual end users and between a group chat and an
            individual end user.
          </li>

        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Enforcement mechanisms</h3>

    <p>
      The DMA represents a new attitude towards platform regulation. It is a
      hybrid form of competition and telecommunications law, whereby a
      designated authority identifies subjects who will fall under the scope of
      the regulation. However, unlike telecom law, which charges national
      regulatory authorities, enforcement is centralized on the European
      Commission. Besides, differently from competition law, the Commission
      imposes remedies on them in advance and not after long and lengthy
      antitrust procedures. For that, the Commission was granted significant
      legal powers for enforcing the obligations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Companies falling under the quantitative thresholds of gatekeeper
      designation criteria (Art. 3(2)) should automatically notify the
      Commission, which will identify the services and products that will
      be regulated. The Commission can also conduct an investigation and
      designate further companies as gatekeepers that meet the qualitative
      criteria of Art. 3(1).
    </p>

    <p>
      Gatekeepers should provide audit reports to the Commission on the measures
      implemented within 6 months after their designation (Art. 11(1)). The DMA
      contains anti-circumvention provisions in Art. 13(4) forbidding
      gatekeepers to engage in behaviour that undermines the effective
      implementation of the obligations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DMA provides the EC with a market investigation tool (Art. 16) to
      examine whether a company should be designated as a gatekeeper, to
      investigate non-compliance by gatekeepers, and to update the list of
      services and the obligations. In case of non-compliance, the gatekeepers
      the possibility to offer commitments to end further proceedings. The
      Commission can impose fines up to 10% of the yearly turnover and, in case
      of systematic non-compliance, refusal to give information, etc. periodic
      penalty payments up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover (Arts.
      30-31).
    </p>

    <p>
      An important element for private enforcement is located in Art. 27 which
      grants any third party (including business, end-users and competitors) the
      ability to inform the regulatory national authority about any gatekeeper
      practice or behaviour that falls within the DMA’s scope.
    </p>

    <h2>DMA and concerns for Free Software</h2>

    <p>
      The monopolistic power of large tech corporations causes distortions on
      digital markets affecting negatively end-users’ rights and control over
      devices. User freedoms relating to Free Software depends on a political
      and economic environment in which they can exercise their free choice
      when using their devices without being stuck in closed environments under
      control of gatekeepers. Digital markets will benefit with DMA regulating
      the commercial practices of large platforms, forcing them to facilitate
      access to Free Software in devices. Device Neutrality translates in the
      DMA as stricter consent rules for pre-installed apps, safeguards against
      vendor lock-in, and data portability. The right for end-users to use their
      own device and operating system is an important factor to guarantee access
      of Free Software operating systems to dominant platforms. As a daily
      reality for many users, this option enlarges the audience for Free Software
      adoption. However, the future holds challenges for the practical
      implementation of the DMA rules and ultimately Device Neutrality.
    </p>

      </a>
      <figcaption>
        The DMA represents a significant step for breaking monopolies over
        devices. However, practical implementation may present challenges for
        Free Software and Open Standards.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Open Standards are missing</h3>

    <p>
      Still in the legislative process, the FSFE defended the inclusion of clear
      language mandating the adoption of Open Standards for the interoperability
      obligations, which was not contemplated in the final version of the law.
      Instead, the DMA mentions "free and effective interoperability"
      (Art. 6(7)) regarding hardware and software features that can be
      accessed/controlled via an operating system by third parties, as well as
      "fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access conditions" to app
      stores, search engines and operating systems. The solution adopted may
      allow gatekeepers to implement proprietary standards and restrictive
      access to APIs that are incompatible with Free Software. This was a lost
      chance to leverage competition with accessible and non-discriminatory
      technical specifications. Open Standards remain an important element for
      innovation by allowing market actors to innovate on top of technical
      standards.
    </p>

    <h3>Security concerns vs commercial interests</h3>

    <p>
      Another source of concern relates to how the law allows gatekeepers to
      limit interoperability for the sake of integrity and security of the
      gatekeepers' services or devices (Art. 6 (3) and (7)). Our experience
      demonstrates that companies have been electing security concerns to limit
      users' rights and software freedom even in the absence of empirical
      evidence of such risks for the integrity of the devices. Instead,
      commercial interests are the main drive to pursue such restrictive
      practices. Such disposition in the DMA has the potential to hinder
      compliance or even, in a worse case, strength or consolidate the
      gatekeepers' entrenched position in the market.
    </p>

    <h3>Complex digital and market environments</h3>

    <p>
      The procedural enforcement efforts also raise questions regarding
      achieving real and effective Device Neutrality. The DMA encompasses the
      regulation of several complex layers of devices, as operating systems,
      browsers, apps stores, as well as interoperability and data portability.
      Similarly to telecommunications law, such measures would require further
      specification and further regulatory efforts oriented for practical
      implementation. As our experience has shown with Router Freedom in the EU,
      although the related telecom rules were much simpler to implement, even so
      it has been taking years to be properly applied by national regulators in
      the EU. Therefore, not only the lobbying power of such platforms, the
      allowances the law made towards "security and integrity", the absence of
      clear language mandating Open Standards and also market pressure can
      relativize the enforcement priorities of the Commission and other
      policymaking bodies.
    </p>
