          <title>How much does freedom influence your life?</title>
              <body>
               The Free Software Foundation Europe believes that freedom is
               priceless and works hard for freedom in the digital society.
               Being a non-profit organisation, much work is done by
               volunteers, but not everything can be done that way. Working
               for something as priceless as freedom does have a cost. That
               is why we would like you to support our work.
