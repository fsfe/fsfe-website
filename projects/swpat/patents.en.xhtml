    <h2>What are patents?</h2>

    <p>The idea of patents goes back to the medieval monarchs who conferred
        rights and privileges in the form of open letters (latin "litterae
        patentes") bearing their royal seal. Such patents on procedures to make
        glass, for instance, were commonly granted on the basis that this skill
        be taught to others.</p>

    <p>Later, democratic governments took the place of monarchs, but the basic
        idea remained the same: a limited monopoly was granted for a certain
        invention or process in exchanged for making that invention or process
        public. That way others could learn from it and further develop new
        inventions and processes.</p>

     <p>The underlying principle of patents and their justification is that
         they are monopolies which are granted by society for the sake of
         benefitting society.</p>
