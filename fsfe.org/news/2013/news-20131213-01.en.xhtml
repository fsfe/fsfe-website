		<h1>160,000 Euro short for 2014</h1>

    <p>As a reader of our website, you are aware of the
    importance of Free Software for a free society. The FSFE has been fighting
    for Free Software since 2001. Since then, <a
    href="/about/timeline/index.html">we have made a big difference</a> by
  exercising political pressure, helping Free Software developers with legal
  expertise, and building public awareness for software freedom. To continue
  this important work, we need a total budget of 390,000 Euro for 2014. We are
  currently still 160,000 short of this goal.</p>

  <p>Today you can support us in our work: either by <a
    href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">becoming a Fellow of FSFE</a> or <a
    href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">by a one-time donation</a>.</p>
