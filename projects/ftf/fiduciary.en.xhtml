	<h1>Fiduciary Programme</h1>

<p>FSFE can act as the legal guardian of Free Software projects. The
Fiduciary Programme allows projects to use the <a href="fla.html">Fiduciary
License Agreement (FLA)</a> to assign copyrights to FSFE, allowing the
consolidation and effective management of their copyright status. It allows
developers to focus on making great applications rather than dealing with
legal administration.</p>

<p>FSFE makes sure projects are in a strong legal position without being
prescriptive; we don't dictate project policy or project management. Our
ob is to make sure you can do your job.</p>

<p>The details of our <a href="guidelines.html">fiduciary selection
process</a> and our <a href="fiduciary-policy.html">policies</a> are
available for review, and your comments are always welcome.</p>

<p>You can also adapt the Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA) to consolidate
your copyright under your own administrative umbrella.  We have a page
containing customisable versions of the FLA <a href="fla.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like more information about our fiduciary programme
please <a href="mailto:legal@fsfeurope.org">contact us</a>.</p>
