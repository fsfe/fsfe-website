    <h1>FSFE invites you to find and report proprietary software advertisements on government websites</h1>

    <p newsteaser="yes">The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is launching a campaign to remove proprietary software advertisements from government websites. Every time that state websites link to non-Free applications and encourage visitors to use them, they unnecessarily threaten their citizens' choice and freedom.</p>

  <p>What would you think about a sign on the highway stating “You need a Volkswagen to drive on this road. Contact your Volkswagen dealer for a gratis test drive – Your Government”? When it comes to PDF reading software, governments seem to think that this is acceptable.</p>

  <p>Websites such as <a href="http://pdfreaders.org/">pdfreaders.org</a>, launched by a FSFE fellowship group early last year, demonstrate that a variety of Free Software PDF readers exist for all major operating systems. Yet despite this fact many publicly funded sites continue to endorse one particular application.</p>

  <p>Such endorsements give unfair advantage to whichever proprietary product they recommend, and are often accompanied by inaccurate statements presenting the application as the only available option.</p>

  <p>FSFE invites European citizens to seek out proprietary software advertisements on their government's websites, and <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/pdfreaders.en.html">report them</a>. In addition, FSFE has prepared a petition demanding an end to such advertising practices, and encourages the public to <a href="www.fsfe.org/campaigns/pdfreaders/petition.html">sign it</a>.</p>

  <p>The hunt begins on September 13th, and will continue until October 17th 2010. Prizes will be awarded at the end of October to the individual or group who reports the greatest number of infringing government websites.</p>
  
  <p>Good hunting!</p>
