      As every year, the FSFE will be present at the GNU/LinuxTag, one of the highlights of the Free Software year since 1996, with many volunteers and presentations to spread knowledge about Free Software and the work of FSFE. Meet many of the FSFE activists and visit their talks about WIPO, GPLv3, DRM, and other topics.
