    <name>Email self-defense with GnuPG</name>
    <description>
      After Snowden's revelations about the mass surveillance programmes of the NSA and other Western security agencies, there is a big interest by the people in reclaiming their privacy as well as secure communication. To help people in their email-communication, we made a leaflet that explains the problems of email-security and how to solve them, using GnuPG for email encryption. In addition, this leaflet explicitly explains what is a backdoor and why software for security measures needs to be Free Software.
