    <title>The Vista message: Upgrade to GNU/Linux now!</title>
    <body>
      <p>
FSFE considers this a unique opportunity: With the release of Vista,
users will need to upgrade to a new operating system that will feel
different and require some time to get used to its functionality. The
same is true for any modern GNU/Linux distribution. It is about the
same investment in effort, but it will give you control over your own
data.
