<h1>Report: FSFE Booth and Activity at Chaos Communication Camp 2023</h1>

<p>The Chaos Communication Camp 2023 brought together technologists, 
activists, and enthusiasts to discuss, share, and celebrate software 
freedom, privacy, and various aspects of technology. The FSFE 
participated in the event, being part of the 'Bits und Bäume' village. 
The village offered a platform for engaging discussions, workshops, and 
activities.</p>

<h2>Activities and Engagements</h2>
<p>
The FSFE booth was only one of the options to find the Free Software 
Foundation Europe at the event. Tobias Diekershoff and Bonnie Mehring, 
who represented the FSFE at the event, also gave several sessions about 
their work for software freedom and the various activities at the FSFE.
</p>

<h3>Talks</h3>
<p>
The first talk, given by Bonnie Mehring, focused on the activities around 
the <a href="/activities/ilovefs">I Love Free Software Day</a>. Even 
though the I Love Free Software Day has been running for over a decade 
now, this was the first talk about its history, the importance of the 
day, past activities, and upcoming ones. Its title "Sharing the Power of 
Appreciation: I Love Free Software Day" says it all. The talk highlighted the 
significance of the annual "I Love Free Software Day" and its impact on 
raising awareness and gratitude for Free Software contributors.

Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</a> coding contest for young Europeans. This 
presentation showcased the importance of involving young minds in Free 
Software, encouraging them to be part of the movement, and helping them 
meet like-minded people and create friendships throughout the contest.

<h3>Workshop</h3>
 <p>
 A workshop on the <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE tool</a> was conducted at the Bits und Bäume 
 workshop tent by Tobias Diekershoff. This interactive session educated 
 attendees about the benefits of using the REUSE tool for managing and 
 sharing Free Software projects, emphasizing the importance of proper 
 licensing and documentation.
 </p>

<h3>Book Reading</h3>
 <p>
 A captivating book reading session featuring the children's book <a 
 href="/activities/ada-zangemann/">"Ada and Zangemann"</a> was also held 
 by Bonnie Mehring at the Family village. 
 This heartwarming story introduced young readers to the world of 
 technology, tinkering, and software freedom through the adventures of 
 Ada, a young hacker who learns about controlling and understanding 
 technology.

<h3>Free Software Singalong</h3>
 <p>
 And as it has become quite a tradition, the FSFE organised the Free 
 Software singalong, a delightful and fun activity that served as an 
 easy entry point for newcomers to learn about and engage with the Free 
 Software Foundation Europe. Three sessions were held, each with musical 
 accompaniment. Attendees enjoyed singing along while connecting with 
 like-minded individuals.
