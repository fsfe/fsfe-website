<li><em>Who can vote?</em> All registered Fellows can vote.</li>

<li><em>Election Platform</em> All candidates will use the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org">wiki</a> and/or their <a href="https://planet.fsfe.org">blogs</a> as a promotion platform, so that
all Fellows can learn more about them.</li>

<li><em>Voting System</em> For the voting process we will use the Schulze
