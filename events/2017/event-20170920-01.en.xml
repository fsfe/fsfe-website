	  <title>Special meeting FSFE Franken on September 20, 2017 in Nuremberg</title>
    <body>
      <p>
	On Wednesday, September 20, 2017, starting at 6:30 pm, the
	local FSFE group Franconia will have a special meeting in the
	Lederer Kulturbrauerei in Nuremberg with special guests from the local FSFE group DÃ¼sseldorf.

        All Friends of Free Software are hereby invited!

        If the weather is nice, we will be in the beergarden, if it
        rains or if it is too cold, we will be inside.  Either way,
        you can recognize us as an FSFE group by our t-shirts and our
        table decorations.

        If you are planning to come, please drop me a line at
        floriansnow@fsfe.org so I know how many seats to reserve.
