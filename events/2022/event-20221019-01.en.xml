        <title>FSFE Netherlands online get-together (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>On the  19th of October, the FSFE Netherlands will have another online local group meeting. The meeting will be from 20:00 until 22:00 CEST on the conference server. It is usually quite 'gezellig' and so most stay until 23:00, but you can leave whenever you see fit. The meeting is open for everybody, and we'll switch to English if not everybody understands Dutch. More information can be found on the wiki. At the meetings we abide by the FSFE Code of Conduct. The URL of the meeting is https://conf.fsfe.org/b/netherlands</p>
