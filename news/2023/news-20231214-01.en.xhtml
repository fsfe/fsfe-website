<h1>Router Freedom tech wiki is now online!</h1>
<p>In recent years we have focused on the policy and legal aspects of Router Freedom. Now, with the help of our Netherlands volunteer team, we are publishing the Router Freedom tech wiki, which provides information on the necessary steps you need to use and connect your own router. We need your help to get it printed!</p>

<p>The FSFE has concentrated its efforts in recent years to conduct a European-wide initiative to defend the rights and interests of end-users regarding <a href="/activities/routers/routers.html">Router Freedom</a>, after the series of reforms introduced by EU telecom law with regards to internet devices and terminal equipment. Numerous reports, policy papers, news items, and dedicated studies have been published so that regulators and legislators all around Europe could make informed decisions to safeguard this fundamental right for net neutrality.</p>
<p>We have also helped people to get active, providing solid material for policy engagement with our <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters/">Router Freedom policy wiki</a> and a <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-router-freedom-activity-summary.pdf">handbook</a> with the most important elements regarding freedom of terminal equipment. And <a href="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/router-freedom-monitoring-tool_581123">we have been successful</a>, contributing to several regulatory processes that introduced Router Freedom in EU member states.</p>
<p>However we were still lacking a practical guide for interested technical people desiring to change their router provided by the ISP, helping them on the path (sometimes not so trivial) of installing their own private router at home. We introduce the new Router Freedom tech wiki, prepared by our <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/BNL">Netherlands team of volunteers</a>!</p>

<h2 id="covering-the-basics-for-using-your-own-router">Covering the basics of using your own router</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.fsfe.org/en/teams/router-freedom-tech-wiki">Router Freedom tech wiki</a> guides you towards Router Freedom. It is set up to be as generic as possible, as each situation is different. Different countries have different legislation. ISPs have different policies in place and provide different information. Lastly your modem or router of choice will also influence the options you have.</p>

<p>This wiki helps you to replace the ISP’s router/modem with your own. Most modems of the internet service provider allow you to set them in 'bridge' mode, so you can use your own router for the internal networking. Although this allows you to separate your internal networking from the ISP, you would end up with two devices where you could just have one.</p>
<p>We would love to hear back from you, and to know more about your experience in setting up your router, sharing what you did and how you did it. Please feel free to check the wiki out and use it. If you already use your own router, share your experience in the comments section or mark your message in social media with the hashtag <strong>#RouterFreedom.</strong></p>

<h2 id="help-us-spread-the-word-about-router-freedom">Help us spread the word about Router Freedom!</h2>
<p>Since several countries have officially introduced the possibility for users to use their own routers, we want to encourage people to try out and enjoy this freedom. We need your help to design, publish, and print materials that can be used on booths and at other in-person events, so people can talk about and collectively learn about using their own routers.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Leaflet</strong>: If we raise <strong>3,000 euros</strong>, we can cover the costs for the design and printing of a new leaflet with a nice and intuitive design for the decision tree, as well as with basic information about Router Freedom. As are all our information materials, it will also be available under a free license on <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword">our website</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Sticker</strong>: As a thank you for your help, did you know that you can order our <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword#device-neutrality">Router Freedom sticker</a> for free to show off on your liberated router/modem?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-router-freedom-initiative">The Router Freedom initiative</h2>
<p><a href="/activities/routers/index.html">Router Freedom</a> is the right that customers of any Internet Service Provider (ISP) are able to choose and use a private modem and router instead of equipment provided by the operator. Since 2013, the Free Software Foundation Europe has been successfully engaged with Router Freedom, promoting end-users’ freedom in many European countries. Join us and learn more about the several <a href="/news/2021/news-20210330-01.html">ways to get involved</a>.</p>
