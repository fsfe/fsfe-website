      As a supporter of FSFE, I am a strong follower of the philosophies,
      principles and the mission of the foundation. I joined as supporter with
      an aim to explain and explore the possible promotion of free coding
      philosophy in the world of IT with freedom. Freedom in terms of
      everything is one of the principal values of our democratic community.
      Associating, supporting and disseminating Free Software is a unique
      mission for equal opportunity, full participation and protection of the
      rights of the digital citizens / "Netizens". I am always excited to have
      the dialogue on scholarly scientific issues with people who have open and
      free minds. Finally I got a community of supporters whose mission is to
      create a worldwide community of free coders. I believe a voice that
      illuminates why Free Software are anticipated well for the open community
      of "ITzens". I think that this will nurture the Free Software Ecosystems
      to grow in multi-dimensions. I admire the FSFE's campaigns - "Public
      Money, Public Code" and "Save Code Share".
