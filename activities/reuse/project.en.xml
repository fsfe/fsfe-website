    <title>Reuse of Free Software</title>
    <description>
    FSFE is elaborating and promoting best practices for Free Software
    developers to encourage reuse of their software. By lowering the
    barrier to reuse Free Software, we can entrench the position of
    Free Software as the foundation and default for all new software.
    Based on
    existing sources and the experience of our community, we want to show
    and encourage the practices we know make the process of reuse easier.
