<h3>General FSFE and Fellowship material</h3>

<h4>"Join the Fellowship" Poster</h4>
<p><img src="/order/promotion/joinfellowship-poster_thumb.png" style="text-align:left"></img>Our "Join the Fellowship" Poster. A good poster to pin on a prominent place, for example inside a Hackerspace, and for use at any public activity.</p>

<h3>FreeYourAndroid Campaign</h3>

<h4>"Free your Android" Poster</h4>
<p><img src="/order/promotion/fya-poster_thumb.png" style="text-align:left"></img>This is the poster of our "Free Your Android" campaign for which are flyers available, too.
