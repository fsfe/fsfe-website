  <h3>Do you find yourself changing your smartphone device too 
		 often?</h3>
  <h3>Are you aware of the impact that growing 
		 smartphone production has on our climate?</h3>
  <h2 class="painted">Then keep using 
		 your phone with Free Software! </h2>

  <p>
	E-waste increases every year. The production of devices requires a 
	lot of energy and resources. To save the planet from being 
	overburdened we need to deal with technology in a more sustainable 
	way. Let us start with one of the most vital pieces of technology 
	in our daily life: smartphones are too valuable devices, to be 
	replaced every other year or even less.

      <h3>Even when the software lags, hardware remains in good condition. </h3>
      <p>
	You may decide to change your device for many reasons. The 
	device becomes slow or non-responsive, or the manufacturing company 
	stops supporting its software, which leads to security risks. In 
	most of these cases the <a 
	href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/about.html#problem-short-life-time-through-software-obsolescence">hardware 
	still works pretty well</a>. So why tossing away your shiny 
	expensive hardware? Wouldn&#39;t it be better instead to update and 
	keep using it? That is what Upcycling Android is about!

      <h3>The software can be replaced.</h3>
      <p>
	  Smartphones can be modified. An operating system is a collection 
	  of software that enables you to use your phone and run 
	  applications on it. You do not need to stick to the default 
	  operating system. Instead, you can install an alternative <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/Android/OperatingSystems">operating 
	  system</a> on your phone.
      </p>

      <h3>Your device can perform better with Free Software.</h3>
      <p>
	How many apps were already on your phone the first time you turned 
	it on? How many of them are you actually using? How many of them 
	run advertisements you are not interested in? Unwanted software and 
	trackers often exhausts the battery and processing power of your 
	device. Switch to Free Software and take back control of your apps. 
	It is your device! Only install the apps you like and you will see 
	your phone performing better than before.

   <h2 class="painted">What you can do to make it yours</h2>
  
  <p>
	Smartphones with alternative and Free Software operating systems 
	give you full control over your device. This way you can modify and 
	update the software as long as you wish and need.

  <h3>Reclaim your smartphone</h3>
  
  <p>
	Replace the operating system of your smartphone with a Free 
	Software operating system. Often you need to root your phone to do 
	so. The vast majority of smartphones can be rooted. There are 
	plenty of Free Software operating systems available which are 
	called "custom ROMs". Each custom ROM comes with different focus, 
	some focus on privacy, others on freedom, on usability and more. 
	Choose the one that matches your purpose best. Your phone will be 
	updated, upgraded and upcycled! Enjoy the look and the feel of a 
	brand new device. 
  </p>
  
 
  <h3>Install Free Software apps</h3>

  <p>
	Even if you are still using your stock Android: Installing Free 
	Software apps is possible in any type of smartphone. You can simply 
	install F-Droid and immediately enjoy the biggest Free Software app 
	store in the Android world! Browsers, Maps, Games, Music, Chats and 
	more, everything in one place! Every app you replace with a Free 
	Software app gets you closer to a long-lasting enjoyable device. 
	Maximise the use of Free Software to contribute to a sustainable 
	digital environment.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="painted">Join the movement</h2>

	Free Software is everywhere around! Millions of people use, share, 
	and develop it everyday. Communities surround the most popular apps 
	and a helping attitude often welcomes newbies. Join us in promoting 
	Free Software into the Android world!
