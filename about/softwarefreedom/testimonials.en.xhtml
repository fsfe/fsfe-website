        The anouncement of the creation of the GNU Project was the beginning of the software freedom movement! Today it is a global and broad
	movement that includes small local companies, large global corporations, civil society
	organisations and thousands of professionals. All are working towards a world where the
	four freedoms are guaranteed: users are free to use software and adapt it to their needs,
	and are able to understand and share it. These rights support other fundamental rights
	such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and privacy.
