<h1>Let’s advocate together for Free Software in the European Elections</h1>

<p>
European citizens will hit the ballot boxes from 6 to 9 June 2024 to 
choose their next representatives in the European Parliament. As the 
campaign heats up, it is important to get active and ensure Software 
Freedom is part of the larger political debate. How can you do this? 
Find practical advice on how to advocate for Free Software in the coming 
months!

<p>
Every five years, European citizens elect their representatives to the 
European Parliament, the EU's sole directly elected institution. These 
representatives shape new EU legislation and how taxpayers' money is 
spent. The electoral campaign has started and candidates across Europe  
are organising and taking part in different events to listen to 
citizens’ demands. Electoral programs are often written during these 
events, together with your input. Get active and ask your candidates 
their stance on Free Software (also known as Open Source).
</p>

<h3>Get to know your candidates and their events</h3>
<p>
Identifying your local EU candidates is the first step to starting the 
debate. You can search political parties’ and institutional websites to 
find the candidates running for election in your area. If elected, they 
are the ones who represent you based on your area of residence and have 
more direct contact with their constituents. In the run-up to the 
elections, round-table discussions, election booths and debates with 
candidates will be held. To find those, do not forget to check the 
candidates’ social network accounts, too.
</p> 

<p>
Additionally, seek recommendations from <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/">local Free Software advocacy 
groups or communities</a>, as they might take part in or organise meetings 
related to the European elections.
</p> 

<h3>Talk to your candidates</h3>
<p>
Once you found a way to talk to your candidates, you can kick off the 
conversation starting with <a href="/freesoftware/">the basics</a>. If 
you cannot find any event around your area, you can directly ask for a 
meeting with the candidates, or you can propose local groups and 
communities to organise one! Ask candidates if they know <a 
href="/freesoftware/">what Free Software is and tell them why it is 
important</a> for a democratic society. If you cannot go to an event or 
meet the candidate in person, you can also write an email to your local 
candidate and ask their position on Free Software.
</p>

<p>Free Software is an important topic when it comes to public 
administrations. You can use the following arguments to explain why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Free Software, thanks to the four freedoms, allows public 
administrations to take control of their digital infrastructure. Using 
Free Software in public administrations is a prerequisite for becoming 
digitally sovereign and crucial for a resilient digital society, 
especially in times of crisis.
</li>
<li>
Free Software licenses help public administrations to escape dependency 
and vendor lock-in, which at a high cost hinders competition and 
innovation.
</li>
<li>
Free Software ensures that the source code is accessible so that 
security holes can be fixed without depending on one service provider.
</li>
</ul>  
<p></p>
 <blockquote>
 <p>Mention the FSFE’s <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">“Public Money? 
 Public Code!”</a> initiative and ask the candidates a position on the 
 topic. Make their answers public to help other people in the EU 
 understand the candidates’ positions on Free Software.</p>
