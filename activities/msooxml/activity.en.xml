    <title>MS-OOXML</title>
    <description>
      Since the very beginning of the standardisation process for
      Microsoft's Office Open XML - OOXML (hereinafter MS-OOXML), the
      FSFE has expressed serious doubts about whether MS-OOXML could be
      considered as open, if even, as a standard at all. The FSFE first
      raised the issue in the community and led the movement against
      the standardisation of MS-OOXML, following closely over the years
      the relevant developments.
