    <title>FSF Europe - Software Patents in Europe</title>

      <center><h1>Software Patents in Europe</h1></center>
      <p>
      Software patents for Europe are currently being pushed forward
      actively by a lobby gathering around the European patent office and
      the Business Software Alliance (BSA), which represents the interests
      of the large U.S. companies. Software patents are a menace to society
      and economy and the FSF Europe is actively involved in the resistance
      against such plans.</p>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    
    <p>The European Commission's original proposal for the directive was
        heavily criticised for allowing unlimited patenting of software,
        calcuation rules and business processes, while making the claim of not
        doing so.</p>
        
    <dl>
    <dt>September 24, 2003:</dt><dd><p>The European Parliament, the only body in the
               European Union that is elected directly by its citizens, had to
               decide on the commission's proposal. Giving the needs of
               European citizens and industry preference, the Parliament
               passed the directive after limiting the scope of patentability
               to exclude pure, abstract software without a technical context.</p>
        
               <p>This decision was regarded a victory for democracy and a step
               towards a more transparent and participatory European Union by
               many.</p></dd>
        
     <dt>May 18, 2004:</dt><dd><p>The council of the European Union, a body representing
               the Ministers of its member states, rejected the parliament's
               version. Instead it agreed upon a new proposal of the
               commission that was in effect identical to the original
               proposal, in some respects even worse. Formal adoption of that
               proposal was delayed, however.</p></dd>
        
       <dt>December 21, 2004:</dt><dd><p>The directive was put on the agenda of the EU
               Council on Agriculture and Fishery to be approved as a
               so-called "A-item" without further discussion.</p>
        
           <p>Paying an unexpected visit, Poland's Vice Minister of Science,
               Wodzimierz Marcinski, vetoed this item at the beginning of the
               meeting, so it was taken off the agenda. Poland received much
               well-deserved applause for this act in defense of democracy and
               prevented serious harm to European economy.</p>
        
           <p>The EU Council can now decide to either try again passing the
        directive as a so-called "A-item" without further discussion or to
        make it a "B-item", allowing for further discussion.</p></dd>
    </dl>
        
    <p>Since it is likely that growing public and political resistance
        against software patents in several countries will then influence the
        outcome significantly, it is also possible they will try to bury the
        directive silently and push again for software patents in the scope of
        another directive, hoping that will pass unnoticed.</p>
        
    <p> For that reason, FSFE asks that the directive is put on the agenda as
        a "B-item" for further discussion to reintroduce the changes made on
        September 24, 2003 by the European Parliament so it can then be
        finally adopted in the second reading in the Parliament.</p>
        
     <p>Until that time it is important that people and companies keep voicing
        their dissent with the plans for software patentability and support
        the initiatives to make this dissent visible -- such as the campaigns
        by FSFEs associate organisation, the FFII.</p>
