Resorting <svn>/branches/test/order/ for to

- cleaning up the mess
- deleting outdated material/data
- more consistency in paths, filenames, article tags
- adding new articles
    baby bodies
    cufflinks
    gnu-pins
    bio/fair trade hoodies
    tshirt-ilovefs
    shirt-fsfs-red
- including more and more better photos (hopefully)

These are just some notes to make life easier for web@ and
translators@, hopefully.

New directory tree

I mkdired /order/articles/
to distinguish to other $things like /promotion/.
I mkdired /order/articles/images/thumbnails/
to store the images consistently.

At /articles/, there should be just one item.en.xml and just
one info.<language>.xml for each language. 

The articles are sorted roughly as they are displayed at
fsfe.org/order There is no technical reason for that, it just
should ease editing.

Getting rid of /<year>/

The following directories contained old articles. All
files in those directories are moved into an archive at
DUS office, beyond svn, for there is no reason to have a
version control for them.

These directories are useless now and can be deleted. No
need for anyone to take further action.

/2001/
/2002/
/2003/
/2004/
/2006/
/2007/

/2005/ contained both, old and actual articles. The data
and pictures of the old ones was handled as above, the
actual data have been moved to /order/articles/item.en.xml
and .../info.<language>.xml
The images have been moved to /articles/images/[thumbnails]/
Filenames of images and paths in item.en.xml have been
changed accordingly.

The following directories contained actual data. It was
handled as above.

/2009/
/2010/

Questions to web@: 

- in all info.ru.xml, the first character (even before
the prolog) is ï»¿. Is that intended? I didn't deleted it yet.

- Do I suggest correct that the only purpose of 
'date="<introducing_date>"' at item.en.xml and        
<xsl:sort select="@date" order="descending"/> at order.xsl
is to sort the articles?

- Before, the built script had to search in all /order/<year>/
I do not know where to tell him how to proceed now. Can you
help here?

- How to proceed on? First asking translators@ to take care
of the few changes, then moving to production branch, ot the
other way round?

TODO Rainer:

  svn del for directories /<year>/ when moving to production branch
  rename article tags in OTK:
    tshirt-hacking2-black -> tshirt-hacking-black
    mug-fellowship -> mug-fellowship-black
    mug-white -> mug-fellowship-white
    mug-white -> mug-fellowship-white
    zipped-fsfs-grey -> hooded-fsfs-grey-zip
    check all hoodies! -> hooded-fsfs...
    ballpen-riva -> ballpen-green
    ballpen-senator -> ballpen-blue
  make photos 
    hooded-fsfs-blue-bio
    hooded-fsfs-grey (logo not actual!)
    baby bodies
    gnu/plussy cufflinks
    gnu pins
    organise better, consistent photos of all articles anyway
  write one sentence about bio and fair trade for
    hooded-fsfs-black-bio
    hooded-fsfs-blue-bio

TODO translators:
  
As most data could be transferred smoothly, in most cases a
rough check should be sufficient. .nb and .fr versions are
just rudimental yet, in other versions some articles are missing
(I would like to encourage the spanish friends...)

remarks:
  remove "second edition" at tshirt-hacking-black
  text on back side of girlie-hacking-black has changed
  add new articles
