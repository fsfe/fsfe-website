<h1>CRA &amp; PLD: Liability rules with large exemptions for Free Software are introduced</h1>

<p>
With today's votes on CRA and PLD on the introduction of liability rules 
for software, a broad exception for Free Software was made, so that 
after long and intense debates individual developers and non for profit 
work are safeguarded.

<p>
On Tuesday, March 12, the two votes in the plenary of the European 
Parliament on the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and the Product Liability 
Directive (PLD) marked the provisional end of a long debate on the 
introduction of liability rules for software - with a broad exemption 
for Free Software.
</p>

<p>
Already at an early stage, <a href="/news/2023/news-20230323-01.html">the 
FSFE argued in a hearing in the EU Parliament</a>, for the inclusion of 
clear and precise exemptions for Free Software development in the 
legislation and for liability to be transferred to those who 
significantly financially benefit from it on the market.
</p>

<p>
The co-legislators have largely complied with our  demands and following 
intensive debates, have significantly improved the Commissionâ€™s 
proposal, by  introducing an exemption for Free Software and including 
it in the articles of the regulation. In the future, individual 
developers and non-profit development of Free Software will be exempt 
from the CRA and the PLD. Nevertheless, the wording  in both the 
regulations are different and a standardisation processes and guidelines 
are still being drawn up. We will therefore closely monitor the 
implementation and whether Software Freedom is protected accordingly. 
The efforts of Free Software advocates have also helped to ensure that 
decision maker in  EU institutions now have a better understanding of 
Free Software and its various stakeholders, which will be useful in 
future debates.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In the debate about liability rules for Free Software, it has become 
clear how important Free Software is for our economic and social 
development. On the other hand, it has also become clear what needs to 
be taken into account in the Regulation when it comes to software 
freedom. This has shown the  immense importance of working together with 
the various stakeholders in Free Software development and distribution 
and as well as to understand and accommodate the different interests of 
these players," concludes Alexander Sander, FSFE`s Senior Policy 
Consultant.</p>
