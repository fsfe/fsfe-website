    <h1>As Microsoft repeal some Xbox restrictions, more apply to other products</h1>

    <p newsteaser="yes">Faced with user protests, Microsoft has been forced to
    make the terms for its latest Xbox gaming console look a little less
    restrictive [1]. However, the “new” (restrictive) terms which had caused
    such outrage were not in fact new at all: they were similar to most other
    proprietary software licences, including those covering other Microsoft
    software products and on-line services.</p>

    <p>Restrictions on selling, sharing and gift-giving appear, for example, in
    the Windows 7 and Office 2013 licences. Similar restrictions will continue
    to apply to the Xbox one in that "downloaded titles cannot be shared or
    resold" [1]. Geographic restrictions can also apply to Office 2013, along a
    class action waiver. Gamers who were angered by the invasive, inadequate
    and mandatory 24 hour check-in and Kinect voice/motion sensor may be
    similarly angered by the clause demaning “you must comply with any
    technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in
    certain ways […] You may not […] work around any technical limitations in
    the software” in the Windows 7 licence.</p>

    <blockquote><p>“Even after reversing course on some of the more egregious
      Xbox One terms, Microsoft still leaves its users wearing digital
      handcuffs,” says Karsten Gerloff, FSFE's president. “We encourage
      everyone to choose Free Software instead, and break free of these
      restrictions.”</p></blockquote>

     <blockquote><p>“While proprietary licenses restrict your freedom, Free Software
      always guarantees that you can use the software for any purpose, to study
      how it works, to share it with others, and modify it to your needs” says
      Matthias Kirschner, FSFE's Head of Public Awareness. “Users should not
      have to beg for these rights.”</p></blockquote>
