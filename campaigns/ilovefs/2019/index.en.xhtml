<!-- For translators: Have a look at the previous years' campaigns. The
IloveFS pages normally don't change that much and you probably can
reuse many parts of them -->

<p>We should remember the power of a simple "thank you" to 
motivate Free Software contributors in their important work for 
society. And the 14th of February (Thursday) is the ideal day to 
do that.</p>

<p>A lot of criticism is exchanged in the Free Software community. We write bug 
reports, tell others how they can improve the software, ask them for new 
features, and generally are not shy about criticising others. There is nothing 
wrong with that. It's constructive, as it helps us to constantly improve. But sometimes we should also show our appreciation and encouragement to those hardworking people behind Free Software.</p>

<h2>Show your love for Free Software</h2>

    <p>Many people are in love with Free Software for different reasons. (<a href="/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.html">full gallery</a>)</p>

<p>Free Software drives a huge number of devices in our everyday lives. It ensures 
our freedom, our security, civil rights, and privacy. It enables everyone to 
participate in a fair society. And since everybody loves Free Software for different reasons, let's show this variety to the world!</p>

<p>Valentine's Day, being the traditional day for people to show their love for others, presents us with the perfect opportunity to say <strong>thank you</strong> to the contributors of the various Free Software we love: developers, translators, designers, testers, or documentation writers, of huge softwares or smaller projects. All of them work to keep the Free Software ecosystem which we enjoy every day healthy, vibrant, and growing.</p>

<h2>Be part of #ilovefs</h2>

<p>It doesn't matter who and where you are or what your background is – everyone can participate in the <strong>"I love Free Software"</strong> day in many various ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, thank your favourite contributors for their work in a personal way by sending one of <a 
  href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#ilovefs-postcard">our 
  postcards</a>.</li>

  <div class="captioned right" style="max-width: 506px; width: 30%;">
    <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#ilovefs">
      <img src="/contribute/promopics/ilovefs-postcard-front-thumb.png" alt="our postcard with the text: I love Free Software - but I love you more" />
    </a>
    <footer>

    </footer>
  </div>
  <li>Show your appreciation publicly using social networks or your blog to 
  demonstrate to the world how many people love Free Software – and thereby 
  motivate others to do the same. Just use the hashtag 
  <strong>#ilovefs</strong> on <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mostodon</a>, <a 
  href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ilovefs">Twitter</a>, or other 
  platforms.</li>
</ul>

<p>If everybody contributes a small part, we can enjoy a beautiful <strong>"I love Free Software"</strong> Day together. </p>
<p>Let's share videos and pictures, tweets, send postcards and blog posts using the #ilovefs, and show our love individually.</p> 

<p>Happy <strong><span style="color:red;">"I love Free Software"</span></strong> Day everyone!</p>
