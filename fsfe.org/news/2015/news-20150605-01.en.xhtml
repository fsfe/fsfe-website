      <h1>FSFE submits comments on Reda copyright report</h1>
		
		<p>On June 16th, the European Parliament's Legal Affairs committee will vote on a report with a number of groundbreaking recommendations for copyright reform.</p> 

		<p>The report was written by MEP Julia Reda (Pirate Party) and consists of a number of very sensible proposals to adapt copyright law to today's challenges. However, the report has also drawn a considerable amount of opposition from stakeholders who benefit from the current, overly strict rules.</p>

		<p>The Legal Affairs committee will decide on the final shape of the report before the vote in plenary session in July. FSFE has provided <a href="/news/2015/news-20150605-02.html">input to MEPs</a> on a number of points that we consider crucial to copyright reform.</p>
		
		<p>FSFE's input to the members of the Legal Affairs committee focuses on the following points:</p>	
		
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>The public domain should be actively safeguarded, extended and opened to authors who want to publish  their work directly onto it.</li>
			<li>Works (software included) produced by public sector should be made available to the public for use and modification.</li>
			<li>Digital Restriction Management (DRM) should not hinder the actual exercise of exceptions and limitations. Source code of such technologies must be published to enable interoperability and respect of user's privacy.</li>		
		</ul>
		</p>
