<h1>I ♥ Free Software Day &amp; SUSE OSCC network</h1>

<p>  
We got an email, a few weeks ago, that caught our attention. It came 
with a donation explaining that it was made in the name of an employee 
network at SUSE. We decided to investigate, asked the people 
responsible, and today we want to share this awesome story with you. 
(Note - this is also a great idea for an initiative to ask your company 
about).

<div>Several weeks ago, we received a really nice message:
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>I'm part of a special interest group / employee network at SUSE called the SUSE Open Source Community Citizens (OSCC). In the spirit of the "I Love Free Software Day", we asked our SUSE colleagues to share why they got into and love Free Software. Every story told was being rewarded with 50 EUR that is going to be donated to the Free Software Foundation Europe, to support any of the activities that you're doing.</em></p>
</div>
<p>
Of course our curiosity was piqued: we wanted to see the messages that 
they shared, to know a bit more about the SUSE OSCC group and this 
initiative and to know why they chose us.
This is what we found:</p>

<p>
On 14 February 2024, SUSE celebrated "I Love Free Software" day with its 
employees around the world with a variety of activities. One of the 
activities, organised by the SUSE employee volunteers of the Open Source 
Community Citizens, was simple: tell us why you got into Free/Libre/Open 
Source (FLOSS) Software and why you love it. Easy, right?
</p>

<p>
But that was not all! With the support of SUSE Cares<a id="ref-1" 
href="#fn1" role="doc-noteref"></a>, the SUSE Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) program,  every story was worth $50! To donate to a 
non-profit charity. And for this occasion OSCC chose the Free Software 
Foundation Europe.
</p>

<p>
About 50 people participated sharing their 'I Love FS' messages, mainly 
internally through the internal communications wall but also externally 
on social media. In total, the amount of 2500EUR was reached, matching 
the Silver Sponsorship level!.
</p>

<blockquote>
<cite>“The employee network / special interest group that organized this 
is focused on Open Source/Free Software and community activities. We 
like and generally endorse many of the activities from FSFE and several 
SUSE employees have been active in free software communities pretty much 
since GPLv2 was released. I personally have a connection to that as 
well”</cite>, explained Dirk Müller, one of the main organisers of this 
activity and a member of the OSCC group.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Andy Fitzsimon, the sponsor of the employee network, said: <cite>“SUSE 
is proud to support the Free Software Foundation Europe, championing the 
 ideals of free/libre software. Our donation reflects our commitment to 
 fostering a collaborative community where technology and innovation 
 benefit everyone.”</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although most of the reasons, often with personal messages that were 
shared by the SUSE colleagues, were shared within SUSE, some were 
posted on public social media. A few samples are below:

<p> 
An awesome action, right? It really makes us happy to hear stories like these 
about I Love Free Software celebrations! And even more, when the 
initiative comes from the employees and the company supports them!</p>
