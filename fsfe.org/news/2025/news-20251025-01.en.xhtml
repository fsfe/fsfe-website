<p>There is a hype about starting a new project, about creating
something from scratch, to see how something that was once just an idea
becomes a reality. The sense of pride you feel after hours of working
sovling a problem and, finally, getting it to work is invaluable. It’s
even more rewarding when you’re working toward a clear goal and a finish
line to cross. In this case, the <a href="/activities/yh4f">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom (YH4F)</a> awards
ceremony in Brussels, the finish line for our six 2025 winning projects.
</p>

<p>For one more time, young Europeans had the chance to tackle their own
projects, making their ideas a reality with Youth Hacking 4 Freedom, the
programming competition for Europeans between 14 and 18 year old. YH4F
gives teenagers the chance to showcase their Free Software skills and
creativity. During six months, starting January 2025, YH4F participants
worked on their own ideas, alone or as a team, submitted their projects
and presented them in front of a diverse jury. </p>

<p>The six winners are awarded cash prizes ranging from €4,096 to
€1,024. </p>
