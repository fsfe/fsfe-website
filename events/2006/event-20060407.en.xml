       <title>Software patents, copyright, and GPLv3</title>
          <body>
	    Ciaran O'Riordan and Gareth Bowker will speak in London on
	    why and what FSFE does to prevent legislative harm to
	    software freedom - harm such as that caused by patenting
	    software or distorting copyright.  O'Riordan will also
	    discuss the GPLv3 and its year-long public consultation
	    process.  Both will take questions.
