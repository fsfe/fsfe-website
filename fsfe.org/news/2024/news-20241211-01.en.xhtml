<h1>Meet Vinícius and Simon, young hackers from Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</h1>

<p>
The 3rd edition of Youth Hacking 4 Freedom  (YH4F) has officially 
concluded, celebrating the impressive talents of young European 
developers. Two of the participants in the 2024 edition are sharing 
insights about their projects and experiences: Vinícius developed an 
automatic telescope while Simon worked on bringing Free Software on the 
SHC devices.

<p>
The <a href="https://yh4f.org">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</a> contest is a 
competition organised by the Free Software Foundation Europe that 
encourages young Europeans to work on  a personal technical project. 
After six months of programming, the competition <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20241027-01.html">successfully ended</a> last 
October with an inspiring award ceremony weekend. This unique 
programming competition is more than just a contest: it's an opportunity 
for young talents to showcase their creativity, learn new skills, and 
contribute to their community. 
</p>  

<p>
Vinícius automated the process of star tracking showcasing, ability to 
upcycle devices with his <a 
href="https://codeberg.org/Batsvini/Automatic_Telescope_YH4F2024"> 
Automatic Telescope</a>, whereas Simon created a <a 
href="https://gitlab.com/1337Misom/openshc-external"> project with SHC 
devices</a> because of the freedom of choosing his own project. In this 
interview, we will learn more about them and their projects with 
different approaches but similar spirit!
</p>  

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> Hi Vinícius! Hi Simon! First of all, 
congratulations to both of you for your participation in the third 
edition of YH4F! Could you please briefly introduce yourselves and tell 
us what you like to do before we delve into your projects?
</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Vinícius:</strong> My name is Vinícius Carrijo Tambascia and I’m 
17 years old. I was born in Brazil and moved to Sweden at the age of 10. 
My hobbies are looking at the stars with the telescope, playing tennis 
and skateboard when the weather is good, and also to make projects with 
software and hardware.
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Simon:</strong> My name is Simon. I am 15 years old living in 
Germany. My hobbies are swimming and programming.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> What was your first experience with programming 
and how did you start learning it? Was it with Free Software?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Simon:</strong> I started to learn programming during COVID, 
when I bought myself a Raspberry Pi 4 and began experimenting with <a 
href="https://archlinuxarm.org/"> Arch Linux ARM</a>. For me, Free 
Software was there from the beginning. I tried to compile obscure 
programs that only met one requirement, but by fixing bugs and reading 
their code, I gained a lot of experience and knowledge about programming
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Vinícius:</strong> My first experience with programming was with 
a Free Software website called Scratch. Scratch allows you to make games 
and animations using blocks as code. It’s relatively easy to use and it 
teaches the concept of programming.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE:</strong> How and why did you decide to join YH4F? What do you like the most about the contest?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Vinícius:</strong> I first heard about this competition from my 
parents' friends. I got interested in this competition because I never 
did anything like this before and I also wanted to challenge my skills 
to see what I could learn and achieve.
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Simon:</strong> I joined YH4F last year because it was the only 
competition in which you could do whatever you want, and it was also one 
of the few competitions where younger people could participate.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> Vinícius, how did you come up with your project 
idea? What motivated you to do your project?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Vinícius:</strong> A month before joining this competition, I 
got a small telescope from my grandparents. I started using it a lot but 
I did have issues trying to point at a star that wasn’t visible to the 
naked eye. I knew this problem would be solved with an automatic 
telescope but they are much more expensive. Therefore I thought I could 
make my own automatic telescope for this competition. Before coming to 
this final idea, I had thought of many other options such as games, 
automatic watering systems for plants, and remote control planes.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> Vinícius, is astronomy a long-standing passion of 
yours or did the project stem from your interest in coding?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Vinícius:</strong> I always had a certain level of interest in 
astronomy but it wasn’t a long standing passion. The telescope helped me 
to gain even more interest in astronomy.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> Simon, what inspired your project idea? What was 
the motivation behind choosing this particular project?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Simon:</strong> I received these devices from a relative, who 
switched to a different smart home system after the shutdown of the the 
one they were using. So I tried to get them up and running in offline 
mode but the encryption keys, used for pairing and communicating with 
the end devices, were not saved from the previous owner.
</p>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> Your project emphasises freedom for users. In 
which specific ways do you think Free Software can empower users when 
integrated into SHC devices?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Simon:</strong> The main goal of my project is to get end 
devices to use an open standard for communicating. Additionally, I want 
to release all software that I write for them so that if I lose interest 
or they break, other people can try to fix any issues/bugs still present 
in the software.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> What were the main problems or challenges that 
you both encountered during the programming phase?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Vinícius:</strong> I had problems throughout the whole process 
of making the project. I started by making the hardware and the 
mechanical part of the telescope. I spent a lot of time coming up with 
ideas on how to move the telescope and all of my original ideas didn’t 
work. Halfway through the competition I managed to move the telescope up 
and down by itself using a system that involved a rope and a motor. The 
next part was to make the telescope move horizontally by itself, however 
this part was much more challenging. I tried so many different ways but 
nothing worked until the end of May. By then I actually had a telescope 
with all the mechanics and hardware working but the problem was that I 
had less than a month for the actual coding period. Time management was 
a big problem here because I spent a lot of time on the building phase 
and little on the programming one. During the programming phase, I 
didn’t know how I was going to do it. I wanted to connect the Arduino 
[board] to astronomy software (like Google Maps but for stars) to get 
the live coordinates of the star you want to track, however I simply 
didn't know how to do that. I tried but got nowhere. Instead I came up 
with an idea to track the stars using a bunch of mathematical equations 
that <a 
href="https://codeberg.org/Batsvini/Automatic_Telescope_YH4F2024">model 
the trajectory of the stars</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Simon:</strong> Mainly, learning how Linux works under the hood, 
especially building my own "OS" using build-root, was a significant 
challenge. Another big problem was that missing documentation for the 
hardware, which meant that I had to figure out all connections to other 
peripherals on my own.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE:</strong> Did you work on your project alone?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Yes, I worked on it alone.</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Vinícius:</strong> I did work on my project alone but I had some 
help. My school helped me with the project by allowing me to use their 
3D printer machine. I could have not done the project without a 3D 
printer. I also had some indirect help from my parents' friends as we 
discussed ideas for building the telescope.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> As far as we understood, Vinícius, you have 
developed software to follow the movement of the stars in the sky. How 
did you do that?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Vinícius:</strong> I tracked the path of the start by coming up 
with equations that could model the star based on its current position. 
The path of the star around the sky is mainly caused by the Earth's 
rotation around its axis and the sun. This is only true for the stars 
very far away unlike the planets in our solar system.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> This sounds like a lot of work. We are truly 
amazed by the effort you put into your project Vinícius.
</p>
<p>
Simon, your project includes both software and mechanical components. 
What were the main challenges in making sure the software and hardware 
work together?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Simon:</strong> The biggest challenge is figuring out how the 
hardware is connected with one another and then adjusting the software 
to fit the hardware.
</p>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> How has participating in YH4F and working on 
these projects affected you personally? What have you learned about 
yourself through this experience?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Vinícius:</strong> Working on this project has helped me to 
develop my coding skills, but most importantly it has shown me that I 
can do more complicated projects than I originally thought. At the 
beginning of the project, I doubted myself that I could do something so 
advanced, but in the end, I realised that anything is possible with a 
lot of dedication and effort. Nothing goes according to plan, but we can 
still go around it and reach the goal.
</p> 
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Simon:</strong> I discovered that there are many people like me 
that love to tinker with electronics and software.
</p> 
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> Do you think you will continue working on your 
project and what would be some next steps you would like to take? Are 
you planning to improve the documentation so that more people can reuse 
your projects?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Simon:</strong> I will definitely continue to work on this 
project, but I will probably stop developing the Linux port because the 
hardware in the central devices is very slow and has no real use any 
more. However, the next step will be to design custom PCBs for the end 
devices and use ESP32s to create a replacement board that uses <a 
href="https://csa-iot.org/">Zigbee</a>, an open standard, instead of the 
closed standard they have used so far. Another reason for switching to 
Zigbee is that I recently switched to Zigbee for my home automation and 
don't want multiple different communication standards that may not work 
after 10 years. I will definitely document the process for developing 
the new PCBs and also share other information I still have for the 
central devices.
</p> 
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> And last but not least, is there any kind of 
advice that you would like to tell new Youth Hacking 4 Freedom 
participants?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Vinícius:</strong> Time management is very important. If you're 
thinking of making a project that involves hardware, then make sure that 
the building period doesn’t take all of your time because the main focus 
of this competition is the software. I believe I could have made better 
software if I had spent less time on the building part and more on the 
programming part.
</p> 
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>
<strong>Simon:</strong> I think you should always just try to do your 
best. Even if you don't win, you will still make friends and have fun in 
the process.
</p> 
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE:</strong> Thank you Vinícius and Simon. We wish you the 
best of luck with your future plans and a lot of success with your 
projects!
