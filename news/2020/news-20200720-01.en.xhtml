		<h1>(Y)our recent successes towards software freedom in Europe</h1>
		
		<p>The spread of Covid-19 brought dramatic and drastic changes for us and our societies, and this shed light on the global need for global solutions like Free Software. Here is a short summary of the recent successes towards software freedom in Europe we achieved together with your help and despite the crisis. </p>
		
		<p>The spread of Covid-19 brought dramatic and drastic changes for us and our
		societies. One of the things most of us experienced was to stay at home or in
		quarantine. Apart from severe consequences people have been facing, suddenly
		many people also have been forced to work from home. In response, our
		community was quick and eager in helping people to stay in control of
		technology. Already, in the very beginning, our community members gathered
		knowledge and <a href="/news/2020/news-20200403-01.html">wrote a guide to freedom respecting online collaboration and
		communication tools into our wiki.</a></p>

		<p>In our official channels, the FSFE focused early on highlighting that <a href="/news/2020/news-20200408-01.html">global
		problems need global solutions</a> and on explaining why <strong>only Free Software 
		creates global solutions and cooperation</strong>. We received positive feedback and 
		we luckily have seen tremendous success with our message: the European Union,
		the World Health Organsation and the EU eHealth Network followed our 
		arguments and they now recommend that any COVID-19 contact tracing app 
		development be published as Free Software. Many countries followed their 
		recommendations, for example Austria with StoppCorona, the Netherlands with
        PrivateTracer, Germany with the Corona Warn App, Czech Republic with eRouška and Italy with Immuni App.</p>

		<p>This is a huge success for software freedom! It is a result of the daily
		work we all persistently invest in Free Software advocacy. <strong>For almost 20
		years the FSFE has been part of an ever growing freedom respecting community in
		Europe.</strong> We gather reliable expertise and consultancy and continuously explain
		to the public and political representatives the benefits of software freedom.
		Now, in the face of the crisis, national and international players finally
		seem to realize the advantages of Free Software.</p>

		<h2>Health care apps as Free Software</h2>
		
		<p>Hopefully, the decision to publish Covid-19 health care apps as Free Software
		by itself helps to change mindsets of decision-makers in the long run. But also
		the viral effect of the preceding discussions, publications and decisions is priceless.
		Major international and national news agencies have reported about health care
		apps becoming Free Software and the benefits involved. In several countries
		we have seen a coalition of scientists, data protection agencies, ministries
		and politicians who argued in favor of software freedom. Every time they
		do, <strong>more people are understanding why software freedom matters for our society</strong>. And
		any time more people are understanding the importance of software freedom, it is
		likely that some of them join our cause.
		</p>


		<p>These developments are part of the success of our work and they show that even
		in a time of dramatic crisis you can help people to understand the benefits of
		controlling technology. On the other hand, there is still a lot to do. Many
		countries still encourage the use of proprietary tracing apps. In other
		countries  - for example in Germany where the Corona Warn App was developed - the
		tracing apps themselves are Free Software but they depend on the proprietary
		"Exposure Notification Framework" only accessible by installing the
		proprietary Google Play services or Apple iOS update. You also need to use the proprietary app
		market to install the app itself. Then <strong>what is all freedom worth if the
		solution depends on third-party proprietary blobs?</strong> And if you have to use
		proprietary software to install them?
		</p>
		
		<h2>Public administrations for Free Software</h2>


		<p>If we take a look at the big picture and away from the COVID-19 apps, <strong>many
		administrations recently have announced that they plan to follow our road to freedom</strong>.
		<a href="/news/2020/news-20200610-01.html">Hamburg</a> wants to focus more on Free Software, <a href="/news/2020/news-20200630-01.html">Munich</a> commits to "Public
		Money? Public Code!", <a href="/news/2020/news-20200424-01.html">the Netherlands</a> commit to Free Software by default,
		the Spanish Municipality of <a href="/news/nl/nl-202007.html#-dinero-p-blico-c-digo-p-blico-">Benigànim</a> signs the Open Letter of our "Public
		Money? Public Code!" campaign and the German city of <a href="/news/2020/news-20200630-01.html">Bühl</a> uses Free Software
		to connect their citizens. We want to help them on their journey and ask more
		to join! We want to make sure people understand that this is a long term
		activity, and we offer help and guidance.</p>
		


		<p><strong>Now is a good time to raise awareness about our mission in new audiences</strong>.
		Progressing for our long term work, the recent successes and the
		public discussions about Free Software we want to speed up the path towards a
		Europe built on Free Software. Please help us to convince more decision-makers
		and to supply them with good material to show the benefits of Free
		Software.</p>
