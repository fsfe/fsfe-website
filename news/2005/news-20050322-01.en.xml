    <title>FSFE to help bring Microsoft to its feet</title>
    <body>
      Pushed by the FSFE, the EU antitrust case against Microsoft is gathering momentum again. "We will help the Commission to bring Microsoft to its feet and move towards re-establishing competition", Georg Greve, FSFE's president. In spite of a record-breaking 497m Euro fine, the software company keeps refusing to release Windows specifications that would make it possible for software developers to have their programs interact with Microsoft's. Georg Greve calls for the EU Commission to impose on Microsoft a fine of 5% of the software company's daily net turnover for each day it refuses to comply with the Commission's demands to reinstate competition in the European software market.
