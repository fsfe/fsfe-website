<p>The Freedom Task Force provides licence support services to individuals, projects and businesses involved with Free Software.  We do this through the provision of services that include consultancy and education.  We are a project managed by Free Software Foundation Europe.
</p>

<h3>Our Methods</h3>

<p>The Freedom Task Force has a <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/about/coughlan/coughlan.html">
full-time coordinator</a>, networks of legal and technical experts, and a team of volunteers. 
On demand we form ad-hoc teams of experts to deal with specific issues.  We believe in positive engagement and constructive dialogue. We seek to resolve issues amicably and for the long-term benefit of Free Software.</p>

<h3>Our Goals</h3>

<ul>
 <li>To collect, analyse and share legal knowledge about Free Software.</li>
 <li>To safeguard the interests of Free Software projects and businesses.</li>
 <li>To bring together experts in Free Software legal issues.</li>
 <li>To work with other groups and help them achieve similar goals.</li>
</ul>
