<h1>Ready for FOSDEM 2023?</h1>

<p>FOSDEM 2023 is taking place in Brussels the first weekend of 
   February. The FSFE team will be participating at the main Free 
  Software convention in Europe with a booth and giving some keynotes. 
   Are you going to be there? Come to our booth and do not miss our 
   talks!</p>

<p>After two years without the chance to meet in person and spend time 
talking with other Free Software friends – and newcomers – around our 
booth, we are almost there: FOSDEM is back as an “in situ” event.</p>
 
<p>FOSDEM brings together thousands of Free Software enthusiasts for 
 one weekend in Brussels to discuss current topics and developments in 
 the Free Software world. This year we are back at the Université Libre 
 de Bruxelles with <a href="https://share.fsfe.org/s/8kZaPS5gifd37KQ">our booth and several talks</a> to encourage and raise 
 awareness on wider issues that impact our movement. Networking is 
 equally important. We have prepared  social gatherings to get to know 
 each other a bit better during the evenings in some informal venues.</p>

<h2>FSFE FOSDEM Legal &amp; Policy DevRoom, TEDective - Saturday 4 February</h2>

day of the conference. Together with our co-organisers Karen Sandler

policy topic.</p>

<h2>FSFE FOSDEM Public Money, Public Code!,  REUSE - Sunday 5 February </h2>
<p>Our second day will start with a talk in the morning about our campaign 
‘Public Money? Public Code!’, in which we will provide a policy brief 
of the state of play of Free Software in the European Union. If you are 
interested in this topic, you should attend another of our talks about 
this issue to learn how to effectively push for Free Software all over 
Europe. That one will take place in the afternoon under the title ‘If 
it’s public money, make it public code!’. 
</p>

<p>Also in the afternoon you can learn about REUSE, our tool to communicate licensing and copyright 
information, which makes developing, using,and re-using Free Software 
easier. 
</p>

<p>Of course, we have more activities, campaigns and topics that 
our team can discuss with you. So stop at our booth! We will be willing 
to answer your questions and show you some of the initiatives that we 
have going on.
