    <title>EURA Slovakia case</title>
    <description>
    The Slovak company EURA faced fines of 5600 euros for not purchasing and use 
    Microsoft Windows operating system for submitting electronic tax reports. 
    The Slovak tax administration gave EURA the option to either buy and use 
    Microsoft Windows or face the fines. The FSFE assisted in this case 
    advocating for platform-neutral solutions for such procedures. Unfortunately, 
    the court ruled against Free Software and Open Standards, but we were able to 
    raise awareness about these wrongdoings in Slovakia and beyond.
