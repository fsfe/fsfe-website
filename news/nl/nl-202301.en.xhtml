<h1>Promising news from Belgium and Dortmund +++ IT Security +++ Job opportunity</h1>

<p>
  In January’s Newsletter: Dortmund embraces Free 
  Software, and Belgium is working to ensure Router Freedom. A 
  cryptographer analyzes IT security. A digital health ecosystem 
  licenses files with the REUSE tool. We are looking for an office 
  coordinator. We look forward to seeing you in FOSDEM and I Love Free 
  Software events.

<h3 id="belgium-ready-to-tick-all-boxes-for-router-freedom">Belgium Ready to Tick All Boxes for Router Freedom</h3>

<p>
  Collaboration with supporters and volunteers brings us closer to 
  victory. We addressed Router Freedom to privacy groups, consumer 
  organisations, regulators, and telecommunications industry 
  representatives. We want the upcoming legislation in Belgium to 
  protect the right of all internet users to choose and use a private 
  modem and router. We were not alone. 260 people from Belgium answered 
  our survey which we could use to show potential barriers to Router 
  Freedom.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/news/2022/news-20221215-01.html">The 
  Belgian telecommunications regulator drafted a framework that ensures 
  Router Freedom for all connections</a>, including optical fiber which 
  was often excluded in other countries. Enforcement of the current 
  proposal will mark a win for digital rights in Belgium.
</p>

<h3 id="dortmund-becomes-exemplary-municipality-for-free-software">Dortmund Becomes Exemplary Municipality for Free Software</h3>

<p>
  By embracing Free Software, Dortmund becomes an example for other 
  municipalities. The City of Dortmund, together with Berlin and 
  Munich, is initialising the &quot;Open Source Big 3&quot; and setting 
  up a &quot;Coordination Office for Digital Sovereignty and Open 
  Source&quot;. This Office in Dortmund will cooperate with the 
  Municipal Joint Office for Administrative Management (KGSt) on Free 
  Software governance. The involvement of KGSt makes this development 
  relevant for all other municipalities in Germany.
</p>

<p>
  We will inform you about the developments in an online event on 11 
  January 2023,  organised in cooperation with the Do-FOSS initiative 
  and the Offene Kommunen.NRW. <a href="/news/2022/news-20221215-02.html">Register to

<h3 id="podcast-episode-what-makes-a-program-secure-">Podcast Episode: What Makes a Program Secure?</h3>

<p>
  Achieving optimal security is a challenge for the average user; we 
  need to decide what level of privacy we need and what we are 
  comfortable with. Cryptographer and privacy specialist Cryptie 
  explains what makes a program secure: it has to be audited, checked, 
  and corrected. Free Software allows more people to audit as more 
  people are allowed to read the code and discover vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately Free Software creates a culture in which people are ready 
  to answer to criticism on systems and software. However there is also 
  Free Software that is not audited, so its security is not confirmed. 
  Conclusion: the best and most secure software is Free Software, but 
  not all Free Software is secure. <a href="/news/podcast/episode-18.html">Listen to our 
  new podcast episode with Cryptie</a>.

<h3 id="digital-health-ecosystem-licenses-files-with-reuse-tool">Digital Health Ecosystem Licenses Files With REUSE Tool</h3>

<p>
  The combination of two ideas, universal access to healthcare and Free 
  Software, gives us GNU Health. Created by GNU Solidario, a non-profit 
  dealing with technology and social medicine, GNU Health is a 
  community-driven Free Software project. While visiting schools in 
  Latin America twenty years ago, the founder, Dr. Luis Falcón, 
  realised that technology needs to support social changes.
</p>

<p>
  To make the licensing clear, the project has recently adopted the 
  REUSE specification 3.0 in its components Hospital Management System 
  (both server and client) and Thalamus (the message server for the GH 
  Federation). Luis presented  the project and the process of the REUSE 
  implementation in a <a href="/news/2022/news-20221219-01.html">video 
  interview</a>.
