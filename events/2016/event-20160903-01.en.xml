		<body>
  <p>On Saturday, September 3rd, we invite for the FSFE birthday party to celebrate 15 years of existence in c-base - the famous hacker space in Berlin, Germany. Opening is directly after the end of Saturday's FSFE summit at 18:00 hours with a warm up and get together. At 20:00 there will be around one hour of program in that we shed light on FSFE's local heroes that keep us growing strong. Afterwards, we start the party with music and drinks - a nice time to revel in the past and look forward to the future.  </p>
