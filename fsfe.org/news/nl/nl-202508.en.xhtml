<h1>MP Explore +++ CRA questionnaire +++ DMA news</h1>

<p>In July we continued working to make the EC aware of the gatekeepers
“excuses” to avoid compliance with the DMA and we are gathering your
feedback about the Cyber Resilience Act. We have also developed a Free
Software tool to help us reaching out to representatives in Parliaments
across Europe. And more: SFP, FOSDEM...</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“It was great spending the weekend at the Software Freedom Flat 
		with the System Hackers! We came together to work on the FSFE's 
		infrastructure, solve tech challenges, share laughs and tech 
		discussions with the volunteers. Of course, we also made sure that the 
		wonderful people working on policy and law to fight for software 
		freedom could do so."</p><cite> Tobias Diekershoff, FSFE System 
		Hackers coordinator - </cite>

<h3 id="mpexlore">Help the FSFE to connect with representatives</h3>

<p>Developed by the Free Software Foundation Europe, MP Explore is a
Free Software tool to help us reaching out to representatives in
Parliaments across Europe. <a href="/news/2025/news-20250731-01.html">We 
need your help! Contribute by adding your
local, regional, and national parliament!</a></p>

<p>MP Explore is a tool designed to retrieve official and publicly
available up-to-date contact information about Members of Parliament
(MPs). This information, alongside other capabilities, such as
filtering, is important for our policy activities to effectively reach
representatives. MP Explore allows to obtain this data from any number
of sources, therefore becoming an effective tool to obtain such
information of political representatives.</p>


<h3 id="cra">CRA: Free Software stewards, maintainers and manufactures, share your
input!</h3>

<p>To assess how the EU Cyber Resilience Act may impact the Free
Software ecosystem, the “Dialogue on Cybersecurity” project, of which
the FSFE is part, <a href="/news/2025/news-20250717-01.html">have 
developed a questionnaire</a>. Its aim is to develop
proposals for guidance.</p>


<h3 id="dma">DMA: Google non compliance with the DMA and our Interoperability
Survey</h3>
<p>Under the DMA, the FSFE with a coalition of civil-society
organisations, prompted the European Commission to open proceedings to
investigate Alphabet's (the parent holding company of Google and several
former Google subsidiaries) regarding the uninstallation of
pre-installed apps in Android. Alphabet is arguing that they are
complying with the law by allowing the end-user to disable these app. We
disagree, deinstalling an applications means its complete removal from
the operating system, not its disabling.</p>
<p><a 
href="https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Joint-DMA-complaint-Alphabet-for-publication.pdf">Read 
our joint complaint</a> regarding Alphabet’s compliance with Art 6(3) 
and 13(4) DMA.</p>

<p>If you are a Free Software developer who has or plans to request
interoperability with the gatekeepers services, remember to <a 
href="/activities/deviceneutrality/interop-survey">fill in our
Digital Markets Act Interoperability Survey</a>. The FSFE is gathering
first-hand experiences from developers requesting software
interoperability to collect crucial input from Free Software developers
who have tried, or plan to try, to request interoperability from
companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon under Article 6(7)
of the DMA. We want to monitor how gatekeepers are handling the
interoperability requests submitted by Free Software developers. We want
to hear the developers’ experiences and to make sure their voices are
heard when gatekeepers fall short of their obligations. </p>


<h3 id="sfp">SFP#36: Policy and EU: Call on the Commission to implement the AI
Act</h3>
<p>In August 2025 the first part of the European Artificial Intelligence
Act enters into force. For our 36th episode of the Software Freedom
Podcast Bonnie and Alex break down <a 
href="/news/podcast/episode-36.html">the current discussion about it and
shed light on the arguments</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, thanks to one volunteer the Software Freedom Podcast has
now transcripts, social interact, and more tags coming.</p>


<h3 id="fosdem">FOSDEM: give us your input for the Legal &amp; Policy Devroom</h3>
<p>We’re already planning the Legal &amp; Policy Devroom for FOSDEM 2026
and want your input! What did you enjoy in 2025 (see the schedule)? What
could be improved, and which topics should we feature if our devroom is
accepted again? Share your feedback at <a href="mailto:contact@fsfeo.org">contact@fsfe.org</a> or on the
Fediverse and contribute to shape next year’s program!</p>

	the weekend, the participants work on some maintenance tasks oon the
	network infraestrcture as well as removing some services, such as jitsi
	or discourse, and improving others, such as the ,onitoring of our
	systems</figcaption>

<h3 id="yh4f">YH4F: Time for reviewing the 2025 projects!</h3>

<p>After six months of dedicated programming, the <a href="/activities/yh4f/jury.html">YH4F jury</a> is now set
to evaluate the submitted projects. The jury consists of Free Software
professionals from diverse backgrounds, who will review the projects
over the coming weeks based on originality, creativity, and code
quality. In the first voting round, the jury will select 12 projects
that are placed on a shortlist and thus eligible for one of the cash
prizes. During the upcoming weeks the young developers will be invited
to an online interview in which they have the chance to present their
work and answer questions before the final prize decisions are made.</p>
<p>The winners will be announced at the YH4F Awards ceremony in
mid-October in Brussels, where they will enjoy an all-expenses-paid
weekend. Six participants will receive cash prizes ranging from €4,096
to €1,024.</p>

<h3 id="conferences">Summer events!</h3>
<p>Summer is also a nice time to visit conferences and attending events.
While we are busy in Berlin with End of 10 events, in where we help
users to installs Linux on their devices, we will be also attending
FrOSCon (Sankt Agustin, Germany) with a booth and several talks.
Moreover, we will travel to Italy to the Scambi Festival 2025 to present
FSFE's work and involvement in the Next Generation Internet
initiative.</p>
