	  <title>'Licences that support freedom' speech at FKFT</title>
    <body>
	    Shane will talk about the types of licence that provide and
	    protect freedoms of use, study, sharing and improvement in both
	    technology and educational text.  He will review the main challenges
	    that platforms like SELF may encounter from the legal point of view and
	    what kind of mechanisms help support reliable legal infrastructure.  He
	    will also discuss the work of FSFE's Freedom Task Force in providing
	    education and support services relating to legal support for Free Software in Europe.
