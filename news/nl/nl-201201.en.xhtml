<h1>FSFE Newsletter - January 2012</h1>

<h2>Preventing 6000 mines against Free Software?</h2>

<p>Competition authorities are investigating the sale of 6000 patents from
Nortel, a bankrupt telecommunications equipment manufacturer, to a consortium
of Apple, Microsoft and four other companies.</p>

<p>FSFE considers it a serious risk to competition in the mobile technology
space, and Free Software as a whole, if those companies acquire these patents.
Soon after the sale, we approached EU and US competition authorities, and in
September submitted a <a href="/activities/swpat/nortel.html">summary of our concerns</a>.</p>

<h2>80 billion EUR for R&amp;D: What will we get?</h2>

<p>The European Commission has adopted a set of proposals for its next
framework program, called Horizon 2020. This program will provide 80 billion
EUR for research and development projects from 2014 to 2020. Prior to
finalisation of the proposal, <a href="/news/2011/news-20111128-02.html">FSFE had
  provided input</a> to the Commission in order to make the program accessible
for Free Software research and projects. FSFE will continue to engage with the
European institutions in order to support the development of Horizon 2020 in
the interest of Europe's citizens.</p>

<h2>Free Software makes German Parliament more secure</h2>

<p>On the request of some members of parliament, the <a
  href="http://von-notz.de/2011/12/verschluesselung-mails-an-uns-ab-jetzt-auch-verschluesselt/">
  German Bundestag's IT-department now supports GnuPG</a>, so members of
the parliament have the option to set this up and receive encrypted and signed e-mails. The
president of the German City Council and Munich's main mayor <!-- DE: Präsident
des deutschen Städtetags und Münchens Oberbürgermeister --> Ude <a
  href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/mk/?p=871">wrote to the EU-Commissioner Neelie
  Kroes</a> that she should support Open Standards and Free Software.</p>

<p>Those are nice examples where politicians understand the advantages of Free
Software and also act upon this knowledge. We want more politicians with this
knowledge. One concrete activity is our <a
  href="/activities/elections/askyourcandidates/askyourcandidates.html">"ask your
  candidates campaign"</a>, where we <a
  href="/activities/elections/askyourcandidates/example-questions.xhtml">send out
  questions</a> to the political parties before elections, and then evaluate the
answers. This year we did so for elections in Vienna/Austria, Switzerland, and
5 federal state elections in Germany.</p>


<h2>Something completely different</h2>

<ul>

  <li>In the dispute between the companies AVM and Cybits the written reasoning
  of the decision of the Regional Court of Berlin <a
    href="/news/2011/news-20111201-02.html">is now available</a>. The court
  confirmed FSFE's view that users of GNU GPLed software are allowed to modify
  and install it even if it is shipped as a part of an embedded device's
  firmware.</li> 

 <li>City officials in Helsinki, Finland, <a
   href="/news/2011/news-20111213-01.en.html">are overwhelmingly satisfied
   after trying out the Free Software office suite</a> OpenOffice.org on their
 laptops. 75% of 600 officials have been using OpenOffice.org exclusively since
 February, as part of a pilot project where the city installed the program on
 22,500 workstations.</li>

  <li><a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/fellowship-interviews/?p=509">In this
    month Fellowship interview</a> Chris talked with Paul Boddie, who has been
  working with Python since 1995, and from 2006 to 2010 was involved in
  organising the annual EuroPython conference, administering various
  conference-related tools and developing the conference website.</li>

  <li>An important decision of the Court of Justice of EU, AG's opinion in
  awaited European interoperability ruling, two software patent cases and much
  more is to be found in our <a href="/news/2011/news-20111220-01.html">legal
    news</a>.</li>

  <li>We are preparing for Document Freedom Day 2012. The <a
    href="http://documentfreedom.org">website was updated</a>, on <a
    href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/df-coordination">the
    mailing list we are discussing new ideas</a>, and you are welcome to
  join.</li>
