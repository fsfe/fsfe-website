    <title>Berlin Fellowship meeting</title>
    <body>
	<p>On 14th of February there will be the next Berlin Fellowship meeting and it is going to take place at <a href="http://zope2.in-berlin.de:8100/wsb/elok/jc-e-lok">e-lok</a> (next to Ostkreuz). There will be the possibility to meet other Fellows as well as other Free Software enthusiasts. This can be quite some fun, especially as it is <a href="http://ilovefs.org">"I love Free Software"</a> day. In addition, you can get good food and best drinks at e-lok to spend a happy evening. Official start is at 19:30.</p>

<p>There is the idea of contributing to #IloveFS by presenting/spreading awesome Free Software. If you have a good software in mind, you would like to share with us and you can explain it in 3 minutes, you are welcome to promote it at our meeting!
