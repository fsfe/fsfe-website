Preamble</A>
</H1>

<P />
Upon entering the digital age, in which real and virtual space will
equally determine the social, cultural and scientific development of
mankind, the Free Software Foundation Europe has the long-term goal to
raise and work on the questions this will necessarily raise.
<BR />
<P />
In this regard the direct function is the unselfish promotion of
Free Software as well as creating and propagating the awareness of the
related philosophical and social questions.
<BR />
<P />
As its acknowledged sister organization, the FSF Europe will join
forces with the Free Software Foundation founded by Richard
M. Stallman in the United States of America. The latter, recognized
tax-exempt charitable organization in the USA, has been dedicating
itself since 1984 to the promotion and distribution of Free software
and in particular the GNU-System, a Unix-like operating system. This
system is mostly known by one of its variants, GNU/Linux, which since
1993 has been used successfully on many computers.
<BR />
<P />
The term Free Software in the sense of the FSF Europe does not refer
to the price, but rather to the following four freedoms:

<OL>
<LI>freedom: the freedom to use a program for any purpose
</LI>
<LI>freedom: the freedom to study the program and adapt it to your
own needs. 
</LI>
<LI>freedom: the freedom to make copies for others.
</LI>
<LI>freedom: the freedom to improve a program and make these
improvements available to others, so that the whole community
benefits. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P />
This definition of Free Software goes back to the idea of freely
exchanging knowledge and ideas that can traditionally be found in
scientific fields. Like thoughts, software is non-tangible and
duplicable without loss. Passing feeds an evolutionary process,
advancing thoughts and software.
<BR />
<P />
Only Free Software preserves the possibility to comprehend and build
upon scientific results. For scientists, it is the only kind of
software which corresponds to the ideals of a free
science. Accordingly, the promotion of free software is also a
promotion of science.
<BR />
<P />
The distribution of information and the forming of an opinion are done
increasingly by digital media, and the trend is to foster the use of
those means for a direct citizen participation to
democracy. Therefore, a central task of the FSF Europe is to train
proficient citizens in these media, thereby promoting democracy.
<BR />
<P />
Digital space (``Cyberspace''), with software as its medium and its
language has an enormous potential for the promotion of all mental and
cultural aspects of mankind. By making it commonly available and
opening up the medium, Free Software grants equal chances and
protection of privacy.
<BR />
<P />
Coining the awareness for the problems related to the digital age in
all parts of society is long-term goal and a core aspect of the work
of the FSF Europe.
<BR />
<P />
Therefore the FSF Europe will seek to increase the use of Free
Software in schools and universities in order to parallelize the
education in real space matters with the creation of understanding and
awareness of problems in virtual space.
<BR />
<P />
Free Software guarantees traceable results and decision-making
processes in science and public life as well as the individual rights
to free development of personality and liberty of opinion. It is the
job of the FSF Europe to carry Free Software into all areas that touch
public life or ``informational human rights'' of citizens.

Means of the FSF Europe may be used for the statutory purposes only.
No person may be favored by expenses alien to the goals of the FSF
Europe or disproportionally high. This applies in particular to
full-time members, that can receive an appropriate remuneration for
the performed work.

<P />

Condition for the acquisition of the membership is a written
application for membership to the executive committee.  

<P />
<BR />
<BR />
                (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;
The general assembly of the members decides on the application

people.  The executive committee can grant the application for
membership passing;  the application for membership must then be
confirmed by the next members assembly. In case of refusal of the
request no obligation exists to communicate the reasons to the
applicant.

</H1>

<P />
<BR />
<BR />
                (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;
Membership ends

<OL>
<LI>with the death of the member with natural persons and/or its
liquidation in the case of legal persons;
</LI>
<LI>by withdrawal from the association;
</LI>
<LI>by exclusion from the association.  
</LI>
</OL>

<P />
<BR />
<BR />
                (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;
The withdrawal is made via written declaration vis-a-vis the executive
committee. The declaration withdrawal must be signed by the competent

broken, a member can be excluded by decision of the executive
committee from the association. Before deciding on the matter, the

decision at the general assembly of the members.  The appeal must be
lodged within two weeks after communication of the decision at the
executive committee. The executive committee has to call in a general
assembly within three months of punctual insertion of the appointment,
which can support the decision of the executive committee with a
majority of three quarters of the remaining members.  Until the final
decision about the exclusion, the member remains suspended of all

<P />

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">

<P />

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
Structure of the association</A>
</H1>

<P />
<BR />
<BR />
                (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Free Software Foundation Europe forms a European federation
structure and is divided into national associations. Those are
associations with own juridical personality after the law on societies
of the European State for its area the association are active.  All
members of the national associations must also be members of the FSF
Europe.  

<P />
<BR />
<BR />
                (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;
In order to preserve the uniformity, the national associations have to
fulfill minimum requirements determined by the extended executive
committee, which are written down in a constitution-template for
national associations. This applies with the exception of requirements
that are inadmissible according to the laws of the state in which the
national association is to be created. In this case the constitution
is to be modified so it reflects the intentions of the
constitution-template most closely. The constitution requires the
acceptance of the extended executive committee before the national
association becomes part of the FSF Europe.

<P />
<BR />
<BR />
                (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;
The finances of the national associations are determined by the
financial order in accordance with &#167;&nbsp;9 sec. 2 of this
statute.

<P />
<BR />
<BR />
                (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;
The national associations can conclude contracts in their own name for
the fulfillment of local tasks, if the means are present for the
fulfilment of these contracts.  They can in no case enter obligations
for the FSF Europe.

<P />
<BR />
<BR />
                (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;
The national associations can only enter negotiations with authorities
and organizations mainly active in their respective areas.

<P />
<BR />
<BR />
                (6)&nbsp;&nbsp;
The national associations are entitled and obliged to bear their own
name trough which the affiliation with the Free Software Foundation
Europe is expressed. This has to be done by adding the denomination
``Chapter'' with the name of the state in English to ``Free Software
Foundation Europe.'' Additionally they can bear the name in the
national language.

<P />
<BR />
<BR />
                (7)&nbsp;&nbsp;
The executive committee is entitled to extract the right for the
guidance of the name ``FSF Europe'' from a national association that
violates this constitution or its own constitution. The national
association can appeal the decision at the general assembly of the
members.  The appeal must be lodged within two weeks after
communication of the decision at the executive committee. The
executive committee has to call in a general assembly within three
months of punctual insertion of the appointment, which can remedy or
overrule the decision of the executive committee with a majority of
three quarters of the remaining members.  Until the final decision
about the exclusion, the member remains suspended of all obligations
and all rights.
