		<p>In May 22 to 25 2014, people all across the European Union are asked to vote for the members of the European Parliament for the next 5 years. This is the best time to ask these candidates about their support of Free Software and Open Standards. Participation is as easy as possible: we offer the written Freedom Pact and templates you can use to contact your candidates and we take care of best public awareness possible. This time, we make a difference.</p>

	<h2 id="what-is-the-pact">What is the Freedom Pact?</h2>
	
	<p>The Freedom Pact is a declaration that was written by Free Software enthusiasts and the Free Software Foundation Europe to give European Elections' candidates an opportunity to show that they stand for software and users freedom.</p>
	
	
	<h2 id="freedom-pact">The written Freedom Pact</h2>
	
	<h4>Considering that:</h4>
	 <p>Access to software determines who may participate in a society where most interactions rely on digital technologies;</p>

	 <p>Free Software, which everyone may use, study, share and improve, enables political, economic, and cultural participation for everyone;</p>

	 <p>The use of Open Standards is critical to achieve interoperability between different IT systems in Europe, and ensure the long-term accessibility of information; </p>

	 <p>Software patents are incompatible with Free Software and are a menace to society and economy, because they restrict innovation, damage businesses and put collaborative creativity in great danger;</p>

	 <p>Free Software  helps to boost European economy by enabling small and medium sized  companies to compete on a local and regional level against existing  software monopolies;</p>

	 <p>Free Software is essential for public bodies to break free from vendor lock-in, obtain value for money, and promote the growth of European businesses;</p>

	<h4>I pledge to:</h4>

	  <ul>
	    <li>promote the use of Free Software in all areas of public life, in particular in the educational sector, so that students can learn in freedom</li>
	    <li>promote legislation to make Free Software the first choice in public procurement throughout Europe </li>
	    <li>promote policies in favour of Free Software, and oppose policies that discriminate against it.</li>
	    <li>promote the widest possible use of <a href="/activities/os/def.en.html">Open Standards</a> in the public sector, as well as the publication and archiving of all public data and documents in formats based on Open Standards.</li>
	    <li>ensure that all software developed with public funds is released as Free Software, so other administrations and the public can benefit from it.</li>
	    <li>strengthen consumers' rights so as to promote users control over their own devices and oppose any measures endangering it.</li>
	    <li>oppose any provision that aims at establishing software patents in Europe and work to end the European Patent Office's practice of  granting patents on computer-implemented inventions</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  

	<h2>Get your candidates to sign the pact</h2>

	<p>Participation is very easy. First, get a list of candidates that stand for the European Elections for your country. You can find the current politicians, representing your country in <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/map.html">a map by the European Parliament</a> - many of them will participate in 2014 elections again. In addition - and to be sure - you can run through the pages of the respective political parties of your country, that run for a European office in 2014. They will most likely have lists of their candidates.</p>
	<p>As a next step, contact these candidates and ask them to sign the Freedom Pact. You can do so in your own words, or you can easily <a href="ayc-ep2014-templates">use our templates</a>.</p>
	<p>Finally, tell us about your activity, join our mailing list to see other peoples activity and do not forget to tell your friends about this campaign via social media, email or in real life.</p>
