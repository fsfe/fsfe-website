        <title>FSFE Women meeting: introduction to content management systems (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>This month the CMS Garden joins the FSFE Women group meeting. The CMS Garden e. V. is a friendly association of the communities of 11 FOSS content management systems. Together they appear at fairs and conferences to join forces instead of competing with each other. Our guests include Meike Jung (founding member and board member, conceptualist and Drupal architect at CoWAIN), Petra Hasenau (Typo3 activist, managing director and co-shareholder of Cybercraft GmbH) and Kati Faude (back office employee for association organization and administration).</p>
      <p>The meetings takes place at 19.30 CEST, it is free of cost, everyone who identifies as female can join.</p>
