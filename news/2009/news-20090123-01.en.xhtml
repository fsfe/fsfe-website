<h1>FTF releases legal infrastructure guide for Free Software projects</h1>

<p>FSFE's Freedom Task Force (FTF) is pleased to announce the release of a 
guide to assist with establishing legal infrastructure for Free Software 
projects.</p>

<p><a href="/activities/ftf/building-legal-infrastructure.html">The guide</a> gives tips on how Free Software projects can consolidate 
their legal position.  It includes information about setting up legal 
entities, dealing with copyright issues, managing trademarks, and best 
practices for project management.</p>

<p>"When projects start to become successful, it's important for their 
members to consider what structures will scale successfully, be 
compatible with the founding principles, and protect the integrity of 
the project community", says Shane Coughlan, FTF Coordinator. "This 
guide provides a starting point for internal debate, and can help 
projects prepare a description of their requirements for consultation 
with experts."</p>

<p>"Every project is different, but all can benefit from ensuring they 
have a sound legal basis", explains Graeme West, FTF Intern. The guide 
was authored by FTF staff in consultation with members of the FTF 
European Legal Network. It is available as part of the <a href="/activities/ftf">newly redesigned 
FTF web site</a>, where other guides on topics like licence compliance 
can also be found.</p>

<p>The guide can be found <a href="/activities/ftf/building-legal-infrastructure.html">at this location</a>.</p>

<h2>About the Freedom Task Force</h2>
