    <h1>#ILOVEFS campaign in 2013 - thank you for celebrating #ilovefs the whole day without borders</h1>

    <p newsteaser="yes">Every year on February 14th, love, relationship with others and also their love to free software is celebrated. All around the world, people were celebrating "I love free software day", <a href="/campaigns/ilovefs/2012/ilovefs.en.html">a campaign that was organised by the Free Software Foundation Europe</a>. We would like to thank you for participating in it and also share some really good quotes, dents, tweets, blog entries and articles that were done because of your dedication to <a href="/about/basics/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>. We are sure that developers read declarations of love and their will find it motivating to carry on their good work.</p>

<h3>Quotes and blog entries</h3>


<p>Gergely Nagy wrote a nice <a href="http://asylum.madhouse-project.org/blog/2013/02/14/i-love-free-software/">blog entry about his love to free software</a>:
</p>
<p> "[...] Whenever I'm feeling down, I take a piece of code, and make it better, then share it with the rest of the world, and knowing that I helped make the world turn, that I contributed to a good cause, a cause that helped me through difficult times - that makes me say that I do love Free Software. And so should you, because knowledge is our greatest asset, and free software helps keeping and improving our knowledge. Cherish it, improve it, love it."
</p>
<p>In opinion of Mirko Boehm, <a href="http://creative-destruction.me/2013/02/14/i-%E2%99%A5-free-software-and-why/">free software makes world a better place</a>:
</p>
<p>
"The benefits of Free Software go beyond the individual contributors and the communities they form. The four freedoms laid out as the foundations of Free Software are a fanfare to the ability to exercise one’s free will, to freely collaborate by helping your neighbors, to achieve independence from directions other people have thought up for us. The effects can be seen all around us – when teaching material for schools is developed collaboratively and freely shared, when government data is opened up to improve the transparency of the political process, when the technical foundations of the internet and the operating systems running modern technology become a common good, and in many other places. People start to expect similar freedoms they learned to get used to in software when engaging in society. And more participation is always better."

<li>ShutterTux - Photography, Linux and Life!:<br/> <a href="http://shuttertux.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/happy-free-software-day/">Love in its purest form, 'unconditional' is the best. In our fast food society, seldom there is place for the unconditional love. If we exclude the love of mom for her child, then most other relations of love don’t hold strong to the bond of unconditional love. However, I feel privileged at the unconditional love showered by the people(developers, maintainers, users etc) of the "Free Software Foundation".</a></li>
