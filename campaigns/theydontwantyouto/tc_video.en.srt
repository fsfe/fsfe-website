1
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:14,910
Trust

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,000
Trust is the personal believe in correctness of something

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,660
It is the deep conviction of truth and rightness and cannot be enforced

4
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,460
If you gain someones trust, you have established an interpersonal relationship

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,080
based on communication, shared values and experiences.

6
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,410
Trust always depends on mutuality

7
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,340
This process has been reshaped by the computer industry

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,750
Now a microchip does that task for you

9
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,040
The industry calls it "Trusted Computing"

10
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,440
This chip will be in computers, notebooks,

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,680
... servers, PDAs, cell phones, game units, DVD-Players, Set-Top-Boxes

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,620
... watches ... [noise] ...

13
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,760
....and it will be in your devices too

14
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,370
What has Trusted Computing to do with trust?

15
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,680
Let us show you

16
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,470
In a Trusted Computing environment

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,850
the major goal is to protect us from potential threats

18
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:41,550
The original Trusted Computing idea is designed to let you decide what to consider as threat and what to consider trustworthy

19
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,790
You can control by your own personal conviction

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,090
Trusted Computing - sounds great, doesn't it?

21
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,050
The industries interpretation of the trusted computing idea looks quite similar

22
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:04,600
Aiming at the same: to fight threats and make computing trustworthier

23
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:11,040
The main difference is, that you cannot decide by your own, what is trustworthy, and what is not

24
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,060
because they already decided for you

25
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,000
And they already decided

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,680
not to trust you

27
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,970
So, if they don't trust you, why should you trust them?

28
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,530
Trusted Computing, sounds great

29
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,240
is it?
