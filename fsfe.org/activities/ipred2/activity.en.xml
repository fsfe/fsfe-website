    <description>
      A second Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive was proposed 
      by the European Commission. It aims to criminalise all "intentional, 
      commercial-scale" infringements and allow rights holders to participate in 
      investigations. The FSFE pointed out to the EU institutions how such laws 
      encourage abuse of the legal system and have a chilling effect on 
      law-abiding activities.
