    <p>Although there are already more smartphones than humans on this planet, we keep producing additional 1.5 billion new smartphones every year. About 75% of them are Android phones, most of which are replaced again and again after only short usage times. This, although <strong>the environmental costs involved in the production of a smartphone are exceptionally high in comparison to its usage time.</strong> "Upcyling Android" is an initiative to change our short-term and linear consumption of smartphones and to <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/howtoupcyce.html">start upcycling our devices</a>. Learn on this page about the problems surrounding software obsolescence and how to overcome them with the use of Free Software:</p>

    <p>Smartphones are very valuable devices, not only for our personal communication and organisation. <strong>Every smartphone is rich in terms of the natural resources and the energy invested to produce them.</strong> Rare earths and other limited resources are required to produce many of the elementary technical components that any smartphone consists of. Many of such resources are not only extremely rare, their extraction often happens under inhumane conditions and causes additional environmental damage. </p>

  </figure>
    <p>During production, goods and resources are send around the globe and assembling our devices involves energy-intensive processes. Once produced these devices are again send around the world to end up in stores and inboxes of customers. Finally, often after just a very short usage lifetime, <strong>the disposal of smartphone devices is equally troubling.</strong> The amount of e-waste increases every year with over 50 million tons of electronic waste globally in 2019. Most of the scrap - including large parts of the recycling - ends up in other parts of the world where the material is thinned through under perilous conditions just to be searched for the last usable raw materials.</p>

    <p>Changing such short-term and linear consumption by extending usage lifetimes of our smartphones is an important factors towards a more sustainable digital society. <strong>Every time we keep using our current smartphone instead of buying a new one we help avoiding the production of new phones and growing disposal of ewaste.</strong> Assuming if only one third of smartphone users would use their devices one year longer as now, this would reduce the production of new smartphones already by hundreds of millions of smartphones yearly and reduce the involved energy consumption significantly. Read more about natural resources, hardware prduction and extending usage lifetime <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html#hardware-production-and-usage-times">in our study on the sustainability of Free Software</a>.  </p>


  <h2 class="painted" id="problem-short-life-time-through-software-obsolescence">Problem: Short life time through software obsolescence</h2>

    <p>To keep using our smartphones as long as we want often is not just a question of will or habit. Many manufacturers prefer that we regularly buy new phones instead of keep using our current ones. Non-repairability of devices, missing spare parts and other hardware-related obstacles are used to prevent users from keep using their devices if even just a minor part of the whole device is broken. Software however, plays an equally important part regarding the life-time of smart devices.</p>


  <h3>Software obsolescence</h3>

    <p>So called <strong>"software obsolescence" occurs when the manufacturer of a software ends the support for a current software so that no further support is provided and the subsequent version at the same time can no longer be executed on the previous hardware.</strong> In this case, the manufacturer runs consumers into the dilemma of either buying new hardware or to live with outdated software and potential security problems.</p>

    <p><strong>Software obsolescence is a major concern throughout the Android world:</strong> Google, the company behind Android, develops the operating system Android and provides the software for no cost to hardware manufacturers. Until recently, Google did not produce any phones themselves and focused on the operating system only. This because the business model of Google is to collect as many data as possible from any user for targeting ads and not to produce and sell hardware. Phone manufacturers whose business is to produce and sell hardware in turn profit from a well-known and widely established operating system for no costs and so they ship their product with the Android operating system.</p>

    <p>To be able to run Android on their phones, manufacturers have to package the software for their exact hardware specifications and firmware. They do however not further develop Android, nor do they profit from continuous phone usage by collecting individual data and selling it to the ad industry. That is what Google does. Which leads to the dilemma that manufacturers have no incentive in updating their once sold phones because it is not their operating system and all the data goes to Google. Instead, manufacturers only profit once which is in the sales of their phones. And so their incentive is to get customers to buy their new flagship phone every once in a while and to trash the old ones although they are still pretty good functioning.</p>

    <figure>

      <figcaption>The graphic shows the a cycle of software support as it should be: when customers buy a smartphone with Android version x pre-installed, it should be common practice that whenever the next version (x + 1) of said operating system comes out, manufacturers offer an update to the previous version on their phones. This practice helps to keep users safe and to keep using their devices over a long period. </figcaption>
    </figure>

   <figure>
      <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/8cce677c760e6c600d84fc97817eb274.jpg" />
      <figcaption>This graphic shows the unfortunately common practice in that the initial manufacturer does not deliver any next version of the operating system as an update on a phone once sold. Instead, the manufacturer often stops further support and users are left with the already mentioned problem of outdated software and potential security problems.</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>On a general note, software obsolescence can also occur vice versa: sometimes software manufacturers do not put efforts in backward compatibility of their software and a new version of the operating system is not able to be run on older devices. If this is combined with an enforced version upgrade by the software, that can also lead to the devaluation of hardware that is actually still functioning by the new software. Such a practice is more likely to happen when manufacturers offer software and hardware in a bundle and try to enforce new sales among customers by devaluating old hardware. </p>

  <h2 class="painted" id="free-software-as-a-sustainable-solution">Free Software as a solution</h2>

    <p>Enforced end of support of a software is a problem known to proprietary business models, mainly because there is just one single entitity able to deliver updates or not. <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> in contrast solves the dilemma of software obsolescence through enabling all users and businesses to legally use, study, share and improve the software through its publication under a <a href="/freesoftware/legal/faq.html">Free Software license</a>. Apart from all the other benefits, this leads into the situation that <strong>there cannot be a forced end of support or lifetime of any such software that is published under a Free Software license</strong>. This is in fact a very sustainable way of preserving digital resources as <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html#examining-the-sustainability-of-free-software">outlined in our study on software sustainability</a>.</p>

    <p>However, although the end of development and continuation of Free Software cannot be enforced that does not necessarily mean that Free Software comes with a never-ending continuation. As in other areas the development of especially unknown software projects or those who do not receive enough support might be stopped at some point in time, even surprisingly, simply due to decreased interest. The critical difference however is that this is not something any single entity can decide or even plan for their marketing purposes, for exampleto speed up the sale of new hardware. If the development of Free Software is stopped by its current authors, any other entity can pick up the software code and continue its development. Again, this does also not happen as a law of nature. But <strong>in practice, Free Software publications often lead to very vital markets with dozens of alternatives and solutions</strong>.</p>


    <p>Now what about the Android world? How can you get Free Software on your phone? In fact, very large parts of the Android operating system - excluding third party apps, the G-Suite and some core libraries - are already Free Software. That is why there are dozens of alternative Android versions on the market that are not from Google, so called "Custom ROMs". <strong>If you like to renew and keep using your Android device after an introduced obsolescence, you can replace the operating system with such a Free Software operating system.</strong> Unlike the operating systems offered by the initial manufacturers, these Custom ROMs often offer continued support, version upgrades and backward compatibility towards older devices.</p>

     <figure>
      <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/4983b53a3ae20cfc7cb417585129e3a0.jpg" />
      <figcaption>The graphic demonstrates the practice of software obsolescence in the row below: manufacturers often end the support of a current software version and customers have to buy a new phone just in order to get a new version of the operating system. Above is demonstrated how Free Software operating systems instead often enable users to update their operating system without having to buy a new phone and keep using their current one. This is good for your money and the environment.</figcaption>
    </figure>



    <p><strong>Custom ROMs are modifications and Free Software operating systems of the original Android operating system, which enable users to install "new operating systems" on "old hardware".</strong> This means, that in many cases at least the current operating version can be supplied with security updates, and sometimes porting to higher operating system versions may also be possible. The users are no longer at the mercy of the dilemma of software obsolescence described above and the lifetime of the respective hardware can thus be significantly increased.</p>

    <p><strong>By extending the usage time of hardware and countering software obsolescence, Free Software can directly help save natural resources and to achieve a more sustainable digitization.</strong> </p>

    <p><strong>Join our initiative and upcycle your phone.</strong> Together we can make a difference and help to reduce our natural resource consumption as well as our CO2 footprint. Installing a Free Software system on your phone helps to keep your hardware up to date and gives you the option to decide by yourself how long you like to use your device. In addition it comes with a lot of other benefits, it gives you <a href="/activities/android/android.html">full control over your device</a> and software, you can finally de-install apps you could not before and you profit from extended privacy protection - just to mention a few.</p>

    <p>Because many manufacturers prefer if you are buying a new phone instead of keep using your current device under your own control, installing alternative Free Software operating systems on Android phones is not always easy. Although it is your own device, manufacturers often try to make you a hard time and restrict the access to your own hardware. Technical measures (e.g. blocking the bootloader) and legal measures (e.g. general terms and conditions and EULAs) are used to prevent you from installing alternative operating systems. But <strong>Upcycling Android is an initiative to help you with!</strong> We collected the most important information for you to <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/upcycle.html">upcycle your phone</a> and offer <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/workshops.html">workshops in several cities</a> for users to come and find help.</p>
