<h3 id="Cyber-Resilience-Act-and-Free-Software-Parliament-waters-down-its-own-position">Cyber Resilience Act &amp; Free Software: Parliament waters down its own position</h3>
 
<p>The European Parliament voted last month on <a href="/news/2023/news-20230719-01.html">its position on the 
Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)</a>. While the position improves on the 
Commission's exemption to protect Free Software, it fails to introduce 
a proper protection. We call on the institutions to put the burden of 
liability only on those who significantly financially benefit from the 
market, while protecting developers and non-profit work.</p>

 
<h3 id="EU-Parliament-intends-to-widen-participation-in-the-Interoperable-Europe-Board">EU Parliament intends to widen participation in the Interoperable Europe Board</h3> 

<p>In July the EU Parliament’s Committee responsible for the 
Interoperable Europe Act adopted its final position. It is a step 
forward towards a more inclusive Interoperable Europe Board while it 
introduces clearer indicators and statistics to monitor the progress of 
the Act. This position must now be upheld during the upcoming trilogue.

<h3 id="YH4F-Coding-is-over">YH4F: Coding is over!</h3> 

<p>The second edition of Youth Hacking 4 Freedom, the hacking 
competition for young Europeans, has just ended. For the last six 
months, the participants have worked on developing their own personal 
Free Software projects. It is now the turn of the YH4F jury to evaluate 
the participants’ submitted projects, taking into consideration 
different criteria such as the originality of the idea, the creativity 
of the project, and the quality of the code.</p>

<p>More and more people are turning away 
from social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube to alternatives 
like Mastodon and PeerTube. Why are they different? How are they 
changing the web? And how can you get involved in the Fediverse? Join 
our symposium and get an insight into these decentralised social 
networks through our talks and workshops! </p>

<p>On July 7-9 FSFE volunteers and staffers met at Linux Hotel, in Essen. From Friday 
evening until Sunday afternoon, we spent time together discussing our current activities, acquiring new knowledge about Free Software 
topics, engaging in fruitful conversations, and of course having a lot 
of fun together.</p>
