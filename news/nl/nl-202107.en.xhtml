  <p>
  In July Newsletter, we invite our community to join the 
    celebrations of 20 Years FSFE, we applaud Finland for securing 
    Router Freedom, and we look into Free Software activities for 
    children. We are getting ready for German elections and invite you 
    to help us support Free Software demands for public administration 
    during the election campaign.

<h2 id="fsfe-20-years-of-empowering-people-to-control-technology">FSFE: 20 years of empowering people to control technology</h2>
  
  <p>
    Long before the first smartphone was introduced, it was evident to 
    the FSFE&#39;s founders that it is the people who should be in 
    control of technology and not vice versa. In 2001, Free Software 
    experts around Europe created the Free Software Foundation Europe. </p>

<p>
    20 years is a long time in computing history and although 
    technology is ever-changing, our values have been consistent. The 
    core of our work is, in a nutshell: educating people on the nature 
    of Free Software, highlighting its political implications, and 
    simplifying its legal preconditions. Matthias Kirschner, President 
    of the FSFE since 2015, <a 
    href="/2021/news-20210721-01.html#a-birthday-message-from-our-president-matthias-kirschner">explains</a> 
    this in his own words in a short video.

    Our work throughout the years would not have been possible without 
    the help of our European community. Whether you have translated our 
    news, used your voice to share our message, helped us financially, 
    or participated in one of our public events: you have helped our 
    cause to take a step further.</p>
    
<p> 
    Would you like to share your thoughts 
    about your time with the FSFE? We are looking forward to hearing 
    from you. Also we would love to see pictures from your activities 
    in the past and share them with the community. Or, if you are 
    feeling creative, you can send us a birthday video, just like the 
    science-fiction author Cory Doctorow did. Do not miss to watch it 
    and to find out more on how to share your throwback on our <a

<h2 id="router-freedom-achieved-in-finland-as-the-most-fair-and-efficient-practice">Router Freedom achieved in Finland, as the most fair and efficient practice</h2>
  
  <p>
    Finland recognises Router Freedom as a digital right, setting an 
    example for the EU. Net neutrality is ensured by EU Regulation. 
    However, net neutrality also means that users have the right to use 
    terminal equipment of their choice, such as a phone or modem. For 
    Finland, this is clear. Traficom, the national agency dealing with 
    transportation, communications, and networks, has a noteworthy 
    stance on the issue, <a 
    href="https://www.traficom.fi/en/communications/communications-networks/open-internet-or-net-neutrality">protecting</a> 
    the rights of end-users.

  <p>
    We <a href="/news/2021/news-20210629-01.html">interviewed</a> Klaus 
    Nieminen, Chief Specialist of Traficom. In his view, Router Freedom 
    benefits end-users, fosters competition in the telecommunications 
    terminal equipment markets, and complies with the Open Internet 
    Regulation 2015/2120 of the EU. He shares that there is no 
    technological necessity to justify limiting end-users&#39; rights 
    to choose their own equipment. Traficom arrived to this conclusion 
    after an objective assessment. Finally, he explains that in Finland 
    Router Freedom also applies to new technologies such as 5G.

    This is the first time since the launch of the Software Freedom 
    Podcast that a FSFE staff member gives an interview in our podcast 
    series. Max Mehl, FSFE Programme Manager, has been with the FSFE 
    since 2011 and has worked on numerous campaigns. With this <a 
    href="/news/podcast/episode-11.html">episode</a> Bonnie Mehring 
    and Max Mehl provide a nice and easy entrance to the very complex 
    world of software licensing.

<h3 id="teaching-free-software-to-children">Teaching Free Software to children</h3>
  
  <p>
    In Kreuzlingen, a city in northern Switzerland, five children had 
    the chance to participate in a 4-day course on Free Software 
    development. The course was free of charge, and it was offered 
    thanks to the creativity and pedagogical skills of FSFE supporter, 
    Peter Bittner. The kids had no prior experience using Linux, so the 
    course started with booting GNU/LINUX from a USB stick, and quickly 
    advanced to working in the terminal using Bash commands and coding 
    Python.

  <p>
    &#39;We need our kids to know what school doesn&#39;t teach 
    them&#39; <a href="https://ferienpass.gitlab.io/blog/">says</a> 
    Peter in his blog about this course. &#39;Pupils are being taught 
    &quot;products&quot; of the technology giants (&quot;Safari&quot;, 
    &quot;Word&quot;, &quot;Excel&quot;, &quot;PowerPoint&quot;) 
    instead of information technology concepts (web browser, text 
    processor, spreadsheet, presentations)&#39;.

  <p>
    By the way, this autumn, the FSFE will launch a new activity for 
    teenagers. Our goal is to share the values of Free Software with 
    young developers. So if you are a young person experimenting with 
    software development, or if you know one, stay tuned.

    (DE) to prepare the promotion of our &#39;Public Money? Public 
    Code!&#39; campaign during the last weeks until the German 
    elections. We need your support to spread our message. If you are

    On June 23rd, Max Mehl, Programme Manager at the FSFE, presented 
    REUSE in the “Leveraging Open Source Responsibly” <a 
    href="https://www.ow2con.org/view/2021/Abstract_Community_Day#23061545">session</a> 
    at OW2con’21. In his presentation, Max Mehl explained how REUSE 
    makes it easier for developers to declare the licensing and 
    copyright situation for their code.  The presentation is available 
    in <a 
    href="https://peertube.social/videos/watch/a3cb5598-7d97-479e-851c-9dee96bc278f">Peertube</a>. 
    This session is part of a long-term effort by OW2 to promote best 
    practices and good citizenship in open source governance.

  <li>
    On July 6th and 7th, Bonnie Mehring and Alexander Sander presented 
    our German federal election campaign to the local groups of 
    Nordhessen and Frankfurt. If you are interested to participate in 
    such a workshop check our upcoming event.
  </li>
  <li>
    On July 22nd,  Bonnie Mehring presented our &#39;Public Money? 
    Public Code!&#39; campaign in the <a 
    href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Women">FSFE women</a> monthly 
    meeting. Also, they discussed what the plans are with respect to 
    the upcoming election campaign of the federal parliament in Germany 
    2021. The FSFE women group is open for all women who are interested 
    in Free Software and technology, and takes place online.

    On July 24th, translators met online to get to know each other and 
    learn valuable tools for their work, such as the webpreview tool, 
    the translation wiki, and Git. The meeting was hosted by Luca 
    Bonissi, who has created the webpreview tool, and Bonnie Mehring, 
    coordinator of <a 
    href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Translators">the FSFE translator 
    group</a> team.

    Alexander Sander, our Policy Consultant, contributed to a report on 
    the use of Free Software in local administrations which was 
    released by the German association for municipal government. The 
    association &#39;Kommunale Gemeinschaftsstelle für 
    Verwaltungsmanagement (KGSt)&#39;, published the <a 
    href="https://www.kgst.de/doc/20210706A0006">report</a> [DE] titled

<h2 id="legal-and-licensing-workshops-2021">Legal and Licensing Workshops 2021</h2>

  <p>
    On July 14th, the Online Legal and Licensing Workshop 2021 was 
    completed. The FSFE's Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop 
    (LLW) has been held annually for the <a 
    href="/activities/ln/llw.html">FSFE's Legal Network</a> since 
    2008, and serves as a conference for <a 
    href="/activities/ln/ln.html">legal experts</a> in the field of 
    Free Software to debate over issues and share best practices 
    surrounding Free Software licenses. Instead of a one-time 
    conference, this year, from March to July, LLW offered online 
    presentations, discussion panels, and workshops continuously.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are very happy to have put up an online edition of the LLW, and 
    we are also looking forward to organize next year&#39;s edition of 
    the LLW hopefully in person, to continue building a robust Free 
    Software legal community.

    On 26 September, a new Bundestag will be elected in Germany. We are 
    engaged around the election and want to ensure with our activities 
    that &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; play an important role 
    for the next government. Therefore we want to make sure that our 
    &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; demands will be included in 
    the coalition agreement of Germany&#39;s next government. To 
    achieve this we need your help and support. We created an <a 
    href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/Bundestagswahl_DE">activity 
    package</a> [DE] for you and will also present it during a workshop 
    on 4 August 2021. If you like to participate,  <a

  <p>
    The biggest financial impact the FSFE faces in these times of 
    physical distancing is the cancellation of Free Software 
    conferences, including our own events. To keep the software freedom 
    movement solid and alive, please consider  <a 
    href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate?referrer=newsletter">donating a
