    <h1>Petition For The Removal Of Proprietary Software Advertising On Government Websites</h1>

    <p>We, <a title="List of signatories" href="">the undersigned</a>, hereby state that we expressly and unequivocally oppose the advertising of proprietary software products on government funded websites.</p>

    <p>Such advertising breaches impartiality and encourages citizens to employ technologies that <a title="How non-free software restricts freedoms" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.html">unnecessarily restrict their freedom</a>.</p>

    <p>The role of government is not to support certain market participants and not others, particularly when doing so works to maintain the monopolies of global software companies.</p>

    <p>In explanations of how to use digital resources that they provide, government agencies should clarify that multiple methods are available, and favour <a title="Explanation of Free Software" href="http://www.fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html">technologies which do not restrict users' digital rights</a>; by linking to <a title="How to link to PDFreaders.org" href="http://pdfreaders.org/graphics.en.html">PDFreaders.org</a>, for example.</p>
    
    <p>Free Software guarantees the users right to: use (for any purpose), study (without secrets), share (with anyone),and improve the software that they use. Many Free Software applications exist for reading the documents that governments provide. It is in the public interest to encourage the use of these applications for purposes of freedom, interoperability, and accessibility.</p>

    <p>Where such proprietary software advertisements persist, we demand that revenue accrued from such advertising be publicly declared, as well as the way in which such funds are ultimately used.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p><a title="List of signatories" href="">The Undersigned</a>.</p>
