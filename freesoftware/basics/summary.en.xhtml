<div align="center"><h1>Free Software</h1></div>
<p><a href="http://www.fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html">Free Software</a> is software that garantees a set of freedoms to its owner. It is "free" as in freedom not as in free beer. To avoid this confusion, other names were developped, such as Open source, Libre Software, FOSS, FLOSS... At the FSFE, <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/documents/whyfs.en.html">we prefer to speak about "Free Software"</a> because this terms reflects better the underlying philosophy of the <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html">four freedoms of Free Software</a>. </p>
<p>The Free Software movement was originated by Richard Stallman in 1983 when he inaugurated the <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/gnuproject.en.html">GNU project</a>. It was based on the idea that the user shall be empowered to have full control over the software s/he had bought, and for this s/he needed between other things to have access to the <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/sourcecode.en.html">source code</a>. Further than the sole work on software, the struggle for the adoption of free software has been extended to the adoption of laws on <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/openstandard.en.html">open standards</a>.</p>
