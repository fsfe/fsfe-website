<h2>== Equipment ==</h2>

<p>Required</p>  

<p>- Web-enabled computers - one per attendee, for finding adverts
- GNU/Linux compatible printer (capable of printing envelopes) - check whether 
you need letters to include the envelope as page 1 or whether you need the 
letters and envelopes to be separate documents for easy printing
- Sufficient ink to print a letter and envelope for each 'bug'
- Printer Paper
- Envelopes
- Refreshment for attendees
- Access to whatever email account or mailing list that reported bugs are sent 
to
- Working script for processing email reports generated by web form (available 
in web SVN)
- Template ODT letter adapted to your local contact details and language
- Approved expense request to cover postage costs

</p>



<h2>Desirable</h2>



<p>- Projector - for showing examples of adverts, demonstrating bug reporting 
page, and projecting identi.ca / chat room feed
- Speakers - for background music
- A small prize for the person who finds the most adverts (eg. box of 
chocolates)
- FSFE leaflets and booth materials - for promoting FSFE to attendees
- Assistance transporting materials to the event venue
- A list of the websites of local councils in your country / area for 
attendees to work through</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>Assemble a group of Free Software activists and:

1. Find adverts for proprietary PDF readers on government websites in your 
country/area
2. Send letters to the institutions responsible asking them to remove or 
replace the adverts

A model letter can be found on the PDF Readers campaign page, and another in 
web SVN. You can modify the letter for easier printing, or to make it more 
relevant to your country/area.

Don't forget to microblog about what you're doing, and use the #pdfreaders tag 
when you do so. You may also want to use tags like #openstandards or #opengov.</p>

<h2>Optional</h2>

<p>- Publish a press release in the run up to the event
- Organise an interview with local radio or podcast in the run up to the event
- Send a copy of petition signatures from people in your country/area in 
addition to the letter regarding the specific bug to each institution
- Email the institutions a copy of the printed letter and optional list of 
signatures
- Send follow up letters to institutions that have been contacted in the past 
and failed to comply</p>

<h2>Note on scripts</h2>

<p>I've created an additional script for processing bug mails. It is written in 
PHP and generates .odt files directly. The existing Python script is more 
functional, but less well documented, so you can take your pick (both are in 
SVN)!</p>
