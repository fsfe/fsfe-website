<h1 class="p-name">Brochure on "Public Money, Public Code"</h1>

<div class="e-content">

<div id="introduction">

<p>What is Free Software? How does it contribute to security and transparency of state digital infrastructure? Which steps can public administrations take? These and more questions are answered in our latest publication "Public Money Public Code â€“ Modernising Public Infrastructure with Free Software".</p>

<p>After launching the <a href="https://publiccode.eu">Public Money? Public Code!</a> initiative in 2017, the FSFE has received a lot of positive reactions from public bodies and state actors. This lead to a large number of requests for further information with a focus on the specific needs of the public sector.</p>

<p>Therefore, we compiled one brochure summarising our own expertise and additional knowledge by leading experts from other areas to help readers from politics and public administrations understand Free Software, its numerous benefits and how to make the first steps to a modern digital public infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Please donate and help us pay the printing and portage costs so we can reach as many decision makers in politics and public administration as possible. In the next months, we will address members of parliament and candidates for the upcoming EU election with this brochure.</p>
    
    <p>We want the next EU parliament, national states and public bodies to increase their support for Free Software through better legislation and procurement rules.</p>
