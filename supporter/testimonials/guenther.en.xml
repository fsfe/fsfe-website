            I&#39;m very impressed with what the FSFE has achieved on the EU and 
            national level. Back when I was working in the public sector I was able 
            to glimpse the vast amounts of money that are thrown at lobbying for 
            proprietary software and so called industry standards in Germany and 
            the EU. It&#39;s astonishing how the FSFE has still managed to get 
            itself heard. Supporting this was one of my motivations for becoming a 
            fellow.
