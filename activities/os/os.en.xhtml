 <h1>Open Standards</h1>

 <div id="introduction">

  <p class="background">
  <a href="/activities/os/def.html">Open Standards</a> allow people to
  share all kinds of data freely and with perfect fidelity.  They
  prevent lock-in and other artificial barriers to interoperability,
  and promote choice between vendors and technology solutions. FSFE
  pushes for the adoption of <a href="/activities/os/def.html">Open
  Standards</a> to promote free competition in the IT market, as they
  ensure that people find it easy to migrate to Free Software or
  between Free Software solutions.

 <h2>Introduction</h2>

 <p>
 The relevance of Open Standards is closely linked to networking
 effects, and has consequently been rising dramatically. The reward
 for gaming the system for proprietary vendors is increasing, so is
 the cost for users of software.
 </p>

 <p>
 Governments, public interest NGOs, including groups that are
 concerned about freedom of competition or consumer rights are
 generally strong proponents of Open Standards. Typical critics are
 the proprietary software vendors and those that represent their
 interests. One of the items that critics seek to highlight is the
 inherent conflict between innovation and standardisation.
 </p>

 <p>
 Standardisation deliberately limits changes to a technological
 basis, including innovation. These limits are introduced in order
 to allow subsequent innovation by everyone that has access to the
 standard and not just the party that controls the technological
 basis. So standards limit the ability to innovate by a single
 party in order to allow innovation on the basis of that standard
 by multiple parties.
 </p>

 <p>
 <a href="/activities/os/def.html">Open Standards</a> allow such innovation by all
 parties with no leverage for the initial developer of the platform
 to limit such innovation or the competition it represents.
 </p>

 <p>
 FSFE's goals include freedoms from lock-in, of innovation and
 competition for everyone. That is why FSFE is a strong supporter
 of <a href="/activities/os/def.html">Open Standards</a>.
