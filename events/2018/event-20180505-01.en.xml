		<title>FSFE Booth at Corso Leopold Street Festival in Munich in Munich, Germany</title> 
 
		<body> 
			<p>Corso Leopold is a bi-annual Street Festival on Munich's Leopoldstraße. Because we believe Free Software to be an essential part of a Free and Open Society, FSFE Group Munich will be present at Corso Leopold with a booth, bringing our Message to the public. We are happy to see Munich's FLOSS community growing, and we feel honored to be part of a group of like-minded organizations (together with digitalcourage e.V, Forum InformatikerInnen für Frieden und gesellschaftliche Verantwortung  and Wikipedia), all present in the same vicinity at the Corso Leopold. Pass by our booth, we're looking forward to meet new people as well as old friends, to thought-provoking discussions as well as nice conversations.</p>
