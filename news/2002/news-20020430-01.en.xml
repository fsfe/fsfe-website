    <title>Recommendation by the FSF Europe and supporting parties</title>
    <body>
      <p>
 The FSF Europe and supporting parties has submitted a recommendation for
 the 6th European Community Framework Programme:
  "Free Software is a concept that has
              fundamentally changed the way some parts of the IT
              sector are working towards a more stable, lasting and
              sustainable approach with higher dynamics and increased
              efficiency. It is obvious that the first region to adopt
              and support this principle on a larger scale can profit
              enormously and get a head-start in the information age."
