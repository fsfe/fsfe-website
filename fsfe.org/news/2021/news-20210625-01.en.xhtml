<h3 id="interview-with-Torsten-Grote">Interview with Torsten Grote</h3>


    <p>
        <strong> FSFE: Do you remember your first contact with the FSFE? What 
        caught your initial attention and how did you get introduced 
        and active? </strong>
    </p>

<div class="answer">
    <p>
        <strong>Torsten Grote:</strong> 
            When I was studying computer science in university, I got increasingly 
            interested in the political and ethical aspects of software. Thus, I 
            discovered the FSFE that seemed to have regular meetings in Berlin 
			where I was living. I subscribed to their <a 
			href="https://lists.fsfe.org/postorius/lists/berlin.lists.fsfe.org">Berlin 
			mailing list</a> in 2007 and soon received an email about a 
			a meeting with a presentation about the first Free Software 
			mobile phone, the <a 
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openmoko">Openmoko</a>. 
			Having heard about the Openmoko before, this got me really 
			excited and motivated me sufficiently to show up at this 
			meeting in person.
        
    </p>

</div>

<div class="answer">

    <p>
        Arriving at my first FSFE meeting, I was warmly welcomed by 
        Matthias Kirschner who was coordinating the Berlin group back 
        then and is now the president of FSFE. There were lots of 
        friendly and likeminded people. I enjoyed the meeting a lot, so 
        that I become a regular participant for many years to come.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through the meetings, but also special activities of the Berlin 
        group, I got more and more involved, joined the German team, and 
        got eventually <a 
        href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/torsten.grote/2009/06/01/i-won-the-ga-election/">elected 
        into FSFE&#39;s general assembly</a> in 2009.

    was an FSFE campaign, designed and implemented to a great extent by 
    Fernanda Weiden. Fernanda also gave an <a 
        href="/news/2021/news-20210420-01.html">interview</a> to celebrate and 
    reflect on the FSFE's 20 year progress.</figcaption>

<div class="question">
    <p>
        <strong>You came up with the 'Free your Android' idea in 2012. What 
        was the status of phone liberation back then? What was the 
        initial spark to create this campaign? </strong> </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">

    <p>
        While the Openmoko was a great phone, its development 
        fragmented and eventually stopped. Few phones were actually 
        produced, but I managed to get one.
    </p>

    <p>
        Smartphones were just starting to become a thing. The first 
        iPhone came out around the same time as the OpenMoko and the 
        first Android phone a year later. Most people had proprietary 
        feature phones and I had hoped that having the Openmoko 
        starting at the same time would give freedom a chance.
    </p>

    <p>
        After this, we saw many other mobile operating systems with 
        more or less Free Software, such as WebOS, Tizen, Maemo/MeeGo, 
        Ubuntu Touch, Firefox OS, and many more. However, so far none 
        managed to compete with today's duopoly.
    </p>

</div>



<div class="question">
    <p>
        <strong>Later, the FSFE moved forward with your idea and pioneered 
        the idea of using Android as a base for a phone using only Free 
        Software. What were the initial efforts, and what were the issues users had 
        to overcome to achieve freedom on mobile devices? </strong>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <p>
        To me it became apparent in 2012 that it would be very hard to 
        compete with Android. It had already a big market share and 
        most importantly, it was mostly Free Software. Since the 
        beginning, people took the source code and made their own 
        modified versions of Android, some becoming popular such as 
        Replicant or LineageOS.
    </p>

  <p>
      It might have been a risky bet to focus on Android, but it seemed the best 
      chance to bring more Free Software to people and it was important to ensure 
      that it stays free and to work to liberate its non-free bits.
  </p>
        
        <blockquote>'To me it became apparent in 2012 that it would be 
        very hard to compete with Android. It had already a big market 
        share and most importantly, it was mostly Free 
        Software.'</blockquote>


    <p>
        The biggest challenge still exists today. It is the lower layers of the 
        device, the hardware drivers and the firmware that are still mostly not Free 
        Software.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another challenge in the early days was installing a different version of 
        Android. Even for technical people this was quite difficult and could render 
        the device unusable. Today, some phones even allow their operating system to 
        be changed with your webbrowser by visiting a website.
    </p>

</div>



<div class="question">
    <p>
        <strong>
            DRM, locked devices, proprietary parts in initial flagship
            cyanogenmod... How did the situation for users who like to put freedom
            first on their mobile devices evolve since the initial start of the
            campaign? After all, did the situation improve or worsen?
        </strong>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <p>
        I'd say the situation improved significantly. There's now more devices to
        choose from, easier installation and many more apps now available 
as 
        Free Software.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, there is also more use-cases like banking, ride-sharing or instant-
        messages that are sometimes only available via a proprietary app and 
        due to their connection to a specific company they are hard to replace 
        with a general purpose Free Software solution.

<div class="question">
    <p>
        <strong>
            The world of Custom-ROMs is hard to oversee and there are 
            many different developments from more or less known 
            entities being shared in different channels. What is your 
            recommendation for a newbie or where can an interested user 
            best start to learn more about Android alternatives?
        </strong>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <p>        
        If you already have a phone that you want to install an 
        alternative Android version on, then LineageOS is a good start 
        since they support many devices. However, they do so by 
        including the same proprietary drivers and firmware that is 
        already on the device anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you don't have a device yet, but plan to buy one, I suggest 
        to choose an Android version first and then buy a device that 
        is supported by it. Only Replicant is using 100% Free Software 
        here and thus supports only old devices.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, I am not aware of a single website that presents 
        and recommends various Android ROMs. Since the situation 
        changes frequently, this is hard to maintain. For example, 
        besides those mentioned already, there's now also CalyxOS 
        gaining popularity.
    </p>

    </blockquote>



<div class="question">
    <p>
        <strong>
            You are also creator of two Free Software mobile apps that 
            are offered on f-droid. What role does f-droid play for 
            freedom on Android devices in current setups and what 
            developments do you expect / wish for or see coming 
            regarding distribution of free software on mobile devices?
    </strong>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">

    <p>
        F-Droid is <strong>the</strong> distribution channel for Free 
        Software apps. Without it, you would need to find, install and 
        update apps manually. So it is a rather central piece in a free 
        mobile device.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        F-Droid is almost as old as Android itself. It has seen many 
        awesome contributors over the years that all helped to make it 
        what it is. But F-Droid has also aged and required substantial 
        work to get modernized. This kind of work is hard to do for 
        volunteer contributors that work without compensation in their 
        free time.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are now many forks and clones of the F-Droid app that 
        would benefit from having F-Droid libraries, so they could 
        share and maintain most the code together instead of each doing 
        their own thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then there is this whole area of building and updating all apps 
        directly from their source code ideally reproducibile. Here, we 
        sometimes see large delays as this responsibility historically 
        lies with a single person.
    </p>
    <p>
        My wish for the future would be that F-Droid finds the 
        governance and funding to tackle these big issues to remain a 
        viable alternative to Google Play.

<div class="question">
    <p>
        <strong>
            What is your personal highlight with the FSFE or an 
            important thing that you learnt from your work at the FSFE?
        </strong>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">

    <p>
        My highlight with FSFE were always the in-person meetings, 
        especially those of the general assembly that would meet in a 
        different European country each time. We were discussing Free 
        Software strategy by day and partying together by night. It was 
        impressive to see how we always managed to establish a 
        consensus between all members on organizational questions.

<div class="question">
    <p>
        <strong>
            And what is a story that still makes you laugh or smile 
            when you remember it?
        </strong>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">

    <p>
        When FSFE started its Free Your Android campaign, I had a big 
        smile over my two ears to see the huge media echo it caused 
        like few FSFE campaigns before. I was glad to see that it had 
        hit a nerve and even the subway news monitors in Berlin had 
        picked it up.
    </p>

    <p>
        Years later, some F-Droid contributors confessed that they only 
        got involved and spend many years improving F-Droid and adding 
        more apps, because they had been motivated to join this work by 
        the Free Your Android campaign. It is great to see what impact 
        a few motivated people can have if they dedicate themselves to 
        a cause.
    </p>

<div class="question">
    <p>
         <strong>FSFE: As a last question, what do you wish the FSFE 
         for the next 20 years?</strong>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <p>
        I wish that FSFE will continue to be a strong and respected NGO 
        with an even bigger staff that will be able to educate the 
        public as well as more and more European politicians about the 
        importance of Free Software, so that we can participate in all 
        aspects of society without having to use proprietary software. 
        Furthermore, I wish that this will lead to all public software 
        spending going exclusively towards Free Software.

<h3>About "20 Years FSFE"</h3>

    <p>
        In 2021 the Free Software Foundation Europe turns 20. This means 
        two decades of <a href="/about/about.html">empowering users to 
        control technology</a>. 
    </p>
        <figure>
            <img 
            src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/53aeebdafa0a0c83324dcafc1e4bef1c.png" 
            alt="Banner with FSFE 20 years. FSFE since 2001" />
        </figure>
    <p>
        Turning 20 is a time when we like to take a breath and to look back 
        on the road we have come, to reflect the milestones we have passed, 
		the successes we have achieved, the stories we have written and 
		the moments that brought us together and that we will always 
		joyfully  remember. In 2021 we want to give momentum to the 
		FSFE and even more to our pan-European community, the community 
		that has formed  and always will form the shoulders that our 
		movement relies on. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>20 Years FSFE is meant to be a celebration of everyone who 
        has accompanied us in the past or still does. Thank you for
	your place in the structure of the FSFE today and for setting
	the foundation for the next decades of software freedom to come. </strong>
