	<h1>Halloween Document II (Version 1.4)</h1> *note: some links have died, but have been left so for historical reasons.
	
	<h2>Linux OS Competitive Analysis:<br>
	The Next Java VM?</h2>
	
	{

This memorandum was clearly written as the followup to the one on Open
Source which I have previously annotated as the `Halloween Document' (now <a
href="halloween1.html">Halloween I</A>; you
should browse it first). Halloween II was leaked to me by a former
Microsoft employee 3 Nov 1998, three days after I published
Halloween I, apparently as a direct result of the national
press coverage that received.<P>

It tells us much less about Microsoft's intentions and strategy than
Halloween I.  On the other hand, it is more directly useful to 
operating-system customers trying to evaluate Microsoft's credibility
vis-a-vis that of Linux vendors.<P>

In this context, the author's extremely positive evaluation of Linux's
market share, performance, reliability, and viability in the server
role is very interesting -- and completely the opposite of Microsoft's
dismissive public statements to date.<P>

Actually, readers would do well to bear in mind that many of the positive 
statements in here are short of the truth; they reflect not so much reality
as the limits of what a Microsoft employee can admit to, even internally.<P>

<B>Key Quotes:</B><P>

Here are some notable quotes from the document, with hotlinks to where
they are embedded.  It's helpful to know that ``OSS'' is the author's
abbreviation for ``Open Source Software''.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote1">*</a>
Linux represents a best-of-breed UNIX, that is trusted in mission
critical applications, and - due to it's open source code - has a long
term credibility which exceeds many other competitive OS's.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote2">*</a>
Most of the primary apps that people require when they move to Linux are
already available for free. This includes web servers, POP clients,
mail servers, text editors, etc
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote3">*</a>
An advanced Win32 GUI user would have a short learning cycle to become
productive [under Linux].
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote4">*</a>
I previously had IE4/NT4 on the same box and by comparison the
combination of Linux / Navigator ran at least 30-40% faster when
rendering simple HTML + graphics.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote5">*</a>
Long term, my simple experiments do indicate that Linux has a chance
at the desktop market ...
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote6">*</a>
Consumers Love It.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote6">*</a>
Linux's (real and perceived) virtues over Windows NT include:
Customization ... Availability/Reliability
... Scaleability/Performance ... Interoperability ...
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote7">*</a>
Linux is emerging as a key operating system in the nascent thin server market
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote8">*</a>
Using today's server requirements, Linux is a credible alternative to
commercial developed servers in many, high volume applications.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote9">*</a>
The effect of patents and copyright in combatting Linux remains to be
investigated.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote10">*</a>
Note, however, that Compaq and Dell merely have to credibly threaten
Linux adoption in order to push for lower OEM OS pricing.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

In compiling these quotes, I have ignored material that essentially
duplicates that found in the <a href="halloween1.html">Halloween
I</a>.<P>

<B>How To Read This Document:</B><P>

Comments in green, surrounded by curly brackets, are me (<a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr">Eric S. Raymond</a>).  I have
highlighted what I believe to be key points in the original text by
turning them <FONT COLOR="red">red</FONT>.  I have inserted comments
near these key points; you can skim the document by surfing
through this comment index in sequence.<P>

<A HREF="#quote1">1</A>
<A HREF="#quote2">2</A>
<A HREF="#quote3">3</A>
<A HREF="#quote4">4</A>
<A HREF="#quote5">5</A>

<P>

<B>Threat Assessment:</B><P>

This memorandum reiterates the sinister suggestion that Linux can be
stopped if standard protocols are ``de-commoditized'' -- that is,
perverted with incompatible extensions, then used to lock in
customers.  This threat is extensively discussed in my annotations
for <a href="halloween1.html">Halloween I</a><P>

This memorandum also suggests that Linux could be attacked through patent 
lawsuits.<P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An excellent piece on the history of the Linux Operation system is provided by Wired Magazine at </FONT><A HREF="http://www.wired.com/wired/5.08/linux.html"><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=3>http://www.wired.com/wired/5.08/linux.html</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=3>.  I've paraphrased some of the key points below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Linux was original the brainchild of Linus Torvalds, an undergraduate student at the University of Helsinki. In addition to a 80386-based kernel, Linus wrote keyboard and screen drivers to attach to PC hardware and provided this code under GNU's Public License on an FTP site in the summer of 1991.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After hosting his work on the FTP site, he announced it's availability on a Minix USENET discussion group in late summer 1991.   By January of 1992, over 100 users / hackers had downloaded Linux and - more importantly - were regularly contributing / updating the source code with new fixes, device drivers, etc.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In contrast to the FSF/GNU work, which provided developers an open source abstraction above the underlying, commercial UNIX OS kernel, Linux's team was creating a completely open source kernel.  In time, more and more of the GNU user/shell work was ported to Linux to round out the platform for hackers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Forbes magazine's story on Linux has some excellent data on Linux's development history http://www.forbes.com/forbes/98/0810/6209094s1.htm:</P>

A Microsoft developer who wishes to remain anonymous comments:<p>

MS really shoots themselves in the foot in driver space.  For those of us
that will willingly spend effort to improve the quality, functionality,
and availability of device drivers for MS OSs, the tools, etc. they
provide are actually getting progressively worse.  This is happening
largely because MS fails to grasp the basic concepts you've been
talking about.  In response to driver quality and availability
issues, they've consistently made exactly the wrong decisions: rather
than encouraging more people to help and providing better tools, they
try to make the system more and more closed and dumb down the tools.<p>

A significant side effect of this is the killing of innovation - MS,
being a monolithic organization, can really only concentrate on a
few initiatives at a time, and improving device (printers, video, input,
disk, ...) functinality and performance is rarely very high on the
list.  This is a great example of where they should let someone else
(either a partner or an industry standards body - or maybe even an open-source
community!) `homestead' a driver space.  Instead they intentionally make it
more difficult for these 3rd parties to contribute.  The reasonably
plausible reason MS gives for this is to improve system stability - they
blame a lot of NT robustness issues on ``bad 3rd party drivers''.  Instead
of helping the 3rd parties build better drivers (better tools, better
tech support/documentation, actually soliciting input from the 3rd
parties, etc.), though, the MS approach is to assert more control of
the driver space by making more of the system closed.<p>

The ironic effect of this, though, is that the 3rd parties still have
the business need to innovate despite the MS restrictions, so they end
up frequently hacking around the closed parts of the MS solutions with
no documentation - and the overall system stability goes down, not up.
By making the system more closed, they are decreasing stability &
quality, slowing innovation, and losing the opportunity to take
advantage of 3rd parties willing to contribute for free.  The desire
by MS to own and control the interfaces is so strong, though, that
they can't step back far enough to understand what they are doing.<p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caldera's OpenLinux installer only provided the client daemon to handle the BootP protocol (as opposed to DHCP) and for some reasons, it didn't install correctly.  I looked around on the CD that Caldera provided for a DHCP daemon and couldn't find one.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A small number of web sites and FAQs later, I found an FTP site with a Linux DHCP client.  The DHCP client was developed by an engineer employed by Fore Systems (as evidenced by his email address;  I believe, however, that it was developed in his own free time).   A second set of documentation/manuals was written for the DHCP client by a hacker in <I>Hungary</I> which provided relatively simple instructions on how to install/load the client.</P>

The full client consisted of about 2600 lines of code.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One example of esoteric, extended functionality that was clearly patched in by a third party was a set of routines to that would pad the DHCP request with host-speciifc strings required by Cable Modem / ADSL sites.</P>

This required jumping into an x-terminal and mounting a new floppy disk into the Linux file system namespace and pointing out to Linux that it was FAT16 formatted.  From there, I launched StarOffice's PowerPoint clone and pointed it at the namespace for the floppy and uploaded the file.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simple slides (such as pure text + bullet points)
imported nearly 100% correctly (although fonts and sizing were

market power doesn't stem from products as much as it does from our

capable of iterative cycles - but at an order of magnitude faster
rate.  On the flip side, however, our incremental releases are
arguably much larger whereas many of Linux's incremental releases are
