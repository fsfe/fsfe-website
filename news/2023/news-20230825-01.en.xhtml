<h1>Chaos Communication Camp 2023: back to the grounds!</h1>

<p>
One of our favourite events was back this summer: Chaos Communication Camp 2023! This event brings together technologists, activists, and enthusiasts to discuss, share, and celebrate technology, privacy, and freedom in Brandenburg, Germany. This year, the Free Software Foundation Europe joined the campers as part of the 'Bits und Bäume' village. 
</p>

<p>
For five days, from the 15th to the 19th of August, this open-air event 
in Zehdenick brought together 6000 people from all over the world to 
exchange technical, social, and political ideas. In the Bits und Bäume 
village, the FSFE crew set up a booth with comfortable air cushions for 
people to talk, read, and discuss Free Software. This relaxed and 
welcoming environment encouraged participants to network and interact 
within the Free Software community.

<p>
As well as taking part in fruitful discussions and listening to 
interesting presentations, our team at the camp also took to the stage 
to share some of our initiatives with the participants.
</p> 

<h2>FSFE talks, workshops, book reading ...</h2>
<p>
Under the title "Sharing the Power of Appreciation: I Love Free Software 
Day", Bonnie Mehring gave an in-depth explanation of FSFE's <a 
href="/activities/ilovefs">I Love Free Software Day</a>, highlighting 
the importance of this event to raise awareness and gratitude for Free 
Software contributors. Although this initiative has been going on for 
over a decade, this was the first time there had been a public talk 
about its history, the importance of the day, past activities, and 
future activities.

<a href="/activities/yh4f">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</a>, FSFE's coding 
contest for young Europeans, was also presented at CCCamp, in this case 
on the Youth Hackt stage. This presentation showed the importance of 
involving young people in Free Software, encouraging them to be part of 
the movement, and helping them to meet like-minded people and make 
friends during the competition. The second round of the contest is <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230724-01.html"> currently underway</a>, while 
the third round will be announced by the end of the year. To stay tuned, 
please subscribe to the <a

mailing list</a>.
</p>

<p>
At the Bits und Bäume workshop tent, Tobias Diekershoff explained the <a 
href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE tool</a>. This interactive session 
showed attendees how to use this set of tools as well as its benefits 
for managing and sharing Free Software projects. REUSE defines a 
standardized method for declaring copyright and licensing for software 
projects, emphasising the importance of proper licensing and 
documentation.
</p>

<p>Last but not least, we also have an event with the little "campers". A 
captivating book reading session of the book<a 
href="/activities/ada-zangemann/">" Ada and Zangemann"</a> in the Family 
Village. This heartwarming story introduced young and not-so-young 
readers into the world of technology, tinkering, and software freedom 
through the adventures of Ada, a young hacker who learns to control and 
understand technology.</p>

<h2>...and Free Software Sing-along</h2>
 <p>
 True to our tradition, we organised the Free Software Sing-along, a 
 delightful and fun activity that served as an easy entry point for 
 newcomers to learn about and engage with the Free Software Foundation 
 Europe. Three sessions were held, each with musical accompaniment. 
 Participants enjoyed singing along while connecting with like-minded 
 people.

<h2>The FSFE at the Chaos Communication Camp</h2>

<p>
FSFE's active participation in Chaos Communication Camp 2023 as part of 
the 'Bits und Bäume' village left an indelible mark. The 
engaging talks, workshops, book readings, and singalongs helped raise 
awareness and educate participants about the importance of software 
freedom, by promoting the values of Free Software at the Chaos 
Communication Camp.

The event was a lot of fun and wouldn't have been possible without the dedication and
commitment of our volunteers. Thank you for joining us at the Chaos 
Communication Camp 2023! ❤️❤️❤️
