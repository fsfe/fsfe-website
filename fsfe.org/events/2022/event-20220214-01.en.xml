        <title>I Love FS Day: Gaming event (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>Every 14th of February, people around the world celebrate the <a href="/activities/ilovefs">“I Love Free Software Day”</a>. On this day we show our love for Free Software and thank all the people contributing to software freedom. This year, we are organising a whole event dedicated to Free Software games. The event takes place online on 14 February 2022 at 18:00-20:00 CET. For the first part of our event, our three expert guests in Free Software games, game engines, and Game Jams will share their experiences, and will immerse us in the world of Free Software games. The talks will also be streamed on <a href="https://stream.fsfe.org">stream.fsfe.org</a>. After the talks, we invite you to play Veloren with us.</p>
      <p>For technical reasons, we are asking people who want to take part in the whole event via our BigBlueButton instance to register in advance (registration is now closed). Everyone is welcome. Participation is free of cost. The event is in English. Read more information about I Love FS Day <a href="/news/2022/news-20220201-01.html">here</a>.</p>
