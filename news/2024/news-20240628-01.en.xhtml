<h1>Interview with last year's YH4F winner, Davide Rorato</h1>

<p>
After six months of programming there are only a few days left until the 
end of Youth Hacking 4 Freedom 2024. We are very excited to see this 
year's projects and to learn more about the participants and their work 
during the past months. Before we dive into the new projects, let us 
take a deeper look at last year's winner, Davide Rorato.

<p>Davide programmed the tool <a 
href="https://github.com/Dave879/ArduPlot">"ArduPlot"</a>, a real-time 
	serial plotter that automatically adjusts itself to your use
 case. ArduPlot provides a nice graphical overview of the sensor data 
 from any Arduino board. But let us hear all about ArduPlot from its 
 developer.
</p><p></p>

<hr />

<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: Hi Davide, thank you very much for your time. 
Before we learn more about "ArduPlot" we want to learn more about you 
and your skills. What was your first experience with programming, and 
how did you start learning to write code? 
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
<strong>Davide</strong>: My first ever experience with programming was 
creating Automator scripts. Automator is an application that lets you 
create a sequence of actions such as keyboard presses and mouse 
movements that can be recorded and then played back without the need to 
write any code (it’s actually a lot more powerful but I used it in a 
very basic way).
</p>

<p>
The next thing I started to experiment with was coding on an Arduino UNO 
that I borrowed from my older brother. When it wasn't in use I would 
write simple programs by copying them from a book of ready-made projects 
and adapting them to suit my needs. This gradually evolved into me 
wanting to know more about programming and electronics, and a couple of 
years later, during summer vacation, I thought it would be fun to 
actually learn how to code, so I opened up YouTube and followed the 
first C++ tutorial I could find.
</p>

<p>
After getting accustomed to the basics, when I got an idea for a 
project, I would start coding until I found a problem I didn't know how 
to tackle. I then googled and tried every way possible to make the 
program work until it did.
</p>

<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Can you remember when you first used Free Software?</p>

<p><strong>Davide</strong>: I think my first contact with Free Software was 
with the OpenOffice suite, followed by the Arduino IDE. Of course at 
first I didn't realise what Free Software meant, and I was simply glad I 
could use the software for free, but as years passed I came to really 
appreciate the ethical principles of Free Software.</p>


<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: How did you find out about this contest?</p>

<p><strong>Davide</strong>: It was thanks to my IT teacher, who told my 
class about this contest when the first edition of YH4F started. I 
actually participated in the first edition of YH4F as well, but I didn’t 
manage to win, and seeing the <a 
href="news/2022/news-20221004-01.en.html">quality of the projects</a> 
that did it was clear why, they were amazing!</p>

<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Why did you decide to join YH4F?</p> 

<p><strong>Davide</strong>: The first year I decided to join because I 
thought it would be an excellent opportunity to do a bigger project, and 
in turn learn a lot of new things that I didn't have an opportunity to 
before. Had I not participated in the first edition, I wouldn’t have 
been able to create ArduPlot the following year.</p>

<p>
For the second edition of the contest, I actually didn't have any plans 
to submit a project, but incidentally I had been working on ArduPlot to 
help with the debugging of a robot for a school project, so the day of 
the submission deadline I thought: “Well, I got nothing to lose so I 
might as well submit this!”. I can safely say I did not regret that 
decision!

<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: And before we talk a bit more about 
	ArduPlot, what did you enjoy the most about this contest?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Davide</strong>: The thing I enjoyed the most was the open-ended 
nature of the contest. Any type of Free Software can be created and 
submitted, with no restriction to a specific type or theme, letting 
everyone work on something they are passionate about at the moment.
</p>

<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>:This is nice to hear, however we 
	also know that this can be quite a challenge for some to find "their 
	perfect project". Here as you said it is very important to find 
	something you are passionate about, or a problem you want to fix. And 
	of course, the YH4F team is there to help you to come up with an idea. 
	Now for some more detailed questions about ArduPlot. Can you explain 
	how ArduPlot works and how you came up with the idea? 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Davide</strong>: I created ArduPlot from a need to analyse 
different types of data coming from a microcontroller for an autonomous 
robotics project one of my classmates and I were developing.
The robot had all kinds of sensors on it, and we needed to split fast 
paced data from the sensors, that required a specific visualisation 
(line graph, heatmap), from the less frequent text logs.
If these two things are mixed together in a single text console, it’s 
much harder to see what’s happening at a glance.</p>

<p>
What ArduPlot does is split this data in two: when it recognises a data 
packet, it gets analysed and displayed as a visualisation. For any other 
case the data gets redirected to a text console.
</p>

<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What was the biggest challenge or 
	problem you faced when developing your idea?</p>

<p>
<strong>Davide</strong>: The main challenge I faced was reading data 
from the microcontroller reliably, which meant reading, parsing and 
displaying it faster than the data coming in, which isn’t a problem with 
low data rates, but as they get higher issues start to appear if 
everything isn’t properly implemented.
</p>

<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>:It sounds like you were already 
	somehow familiar with microcontrollers before you started ArduPlot. 
	Have you worked with the data from microcontrollers before? 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Davide</strong>: Yes, but in past projects I didn’t need this 
type of detailed visual feedback. The Serial Plotter in the Arduino IDE 
sufficed most of the time, because I had a couple of sensors at most 
attached to the microcontroller.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: Are there any problems that 
	ArduPlot has solved for you when working with this kind of data? 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Davide</strong>: ArduPlot made it possible to see through the 
'eyes' of the robot in real time and discover and fix bugs faster. For 
example, if a sensor got slightly moved and suddenly the robot started to 
work badly, we instantly knew what went wrong at a glance by looking at the data.
</p>

<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What motivated you to keep working 
	on ArduPlot during the programming period?</p>

<p>
<strong>Davide</strong>: The main motivation was the fact that I 
actually needed the program I was developing, and without ArduPlot, 
debugging the code of the robot would have been much more time-consuming.
</p>

<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Have you continued to work on your 
	project in recent months?</p>

<p>
<strong>Davide</strong>: Yes, but not as much as I wanted to. I have 
lots of ideas for features I want to implement (and bugs that need to be 
fixed) but during the past months I have been busy with other projects, 
and most importantly university, which I have prioritised.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, since the contest ended I’ve added Windows support, I 
fixed a couple of critical bugs, optimised heatmap rendering, added 
friendly USB device names alongside the serial device’s location on 
Linux and added serial output, which was the last thing keeping ArduPlot 
from reaching feature parity with the Arduino integrated serial 
terminal/plotter, but with the addition of other quality of life 
improvements, such as auto reconnect and, of course, the ability to plot 
graphs on demand!
</p>

<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: 
And last but not least, is there anything you would tell new participants to do or not to do? 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Davide</strong>: Build something you are passionate about and 
that other people would find useful or cool, but most importantly have 
fun doing it!
</p>

<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>:Thank you Davide for your time, it 
	was a pleasure to meet you in the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom contest.
