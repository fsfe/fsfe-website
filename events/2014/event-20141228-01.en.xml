   <title>FSFE Assembly at the Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany</title>
   <body>
    From December 27 to 30, FSFE will be present with a so-called “assembly” at the 31st Chaos Communication Congress. It will be a place to get to know FSFE and our mission as well as a place for every Fellow and friend of Free Software to meet, greet, connect or hack. There will be talks and workshops every day around 2pm, for example about GnuPG encryption with the Fellowship smart card / Android security and privacy with Free Software. Finally we bring a Free Software Free Scultpure - Artwork by Kai Mertens. Pass by and join our community.
