<h1>SFP#19: Why we need Free Software on medical devices with Karen Sandler</h1>

<p>
For this episode Bonnie Mehring met with Karen Sandler to talk about 
her relationship with Free Software. Karen depends on a medical device 
to keep her heart working. This led her to become an advocate for 
Free Software in medical devices.

<p>
In her daily life Karen relies on a defibrillator to help her 
heart work properly. Like many medical devices this defibrillator uses 
proprietary software. Therefore Karen had to put software into her body 
over which she has no control in order to let her heart keep working. In 
this episode Bonnie Mehring talks to Karen about the problems that are 
occuring with non-free medical devices and why it is important to have 
Free Software on them. What happens to people when their support ends 
when the company that manufactures their devices goes bankrupt? And what is the 
connection with Dick Cheney?</p>
<p>Listen to Karen and Bonnie talk about the importance of Free Software on medical devices and find out more about 
Karen's heartwarming story of software freedom.
