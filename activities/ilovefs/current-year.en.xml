  <h2>I ♥ Free Software Day 2023: Meet and Connect</h2>

    <p>For the past years we hardly had the chance to meet each other in 
    person. Now we are bringing back in person 
    meetings for the "I Love Free Software Day". Let's celebrate our 
    love for Free Software - you are invited!
    </p>
    
<p>The "I Love Free Software Day" has been a tradition that 
lasts years. On this day we thank all the people behind Free Software 
projects or programs and let them know that their work does not go 
unnoticed. Let's celebrate together all the wonderful people working for 
Free Software. Therefore you are invited to join "I Love Free Software 
Day" celebrations all across Europe. Connect with your 
<a href="/community/groups.html">local FSFE group</a> and organise 
a fun meetup. 
</p>
      
   <p>
   We are grateful to those who work and contribute to the 
   Free Software universe: developers, designers, 
   translators, advocates, donors, users, and more. 
   There are a lot of different Free Software communities out there, 
   with different values or different focuses in their work. But we all 
   share our love for Free Software and value the freedom
   to use, study, share and improve software. Let's meet and connect! 
   Let's show our appreciation with a simple "Thank 
   you!"
   </p>
