    <p>
      If you donate more than 120 Euro in a year, we would like to add your
      name to our <a href="thankgnus.html">donors list</a>. For online
      donations, you can use the checkbox "I want to remain anonymous" to
      indicate whether or not being listed there is ok with you. If you send
      your donation by bank transfer, please
      <a href="mailto:office@fsfeurope.org">contact us</a> about this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, you can include our
      <a href="/about/graphics/sponsoring/sponsoring.html">Sponsoring buttons</a>
      on your own web page to show your support for us.
