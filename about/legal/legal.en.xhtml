    <h1>Legal Structure</h1>

<p id="introduction">The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is an <a
href="/about/self-conception.html">international, team-based
organisation</a>. Legally, it is set up around a central organisation
which can be expanded into other countries in a modular way.</p>

<h2>The main association</h2>

<p>The main association (Hub) is the central legal body, the core of
the Free Software Foundation
Europe. All <a href="/about/members.html">members</a> of the FSFE are
members of this association.</p>

<p>This main association provides the legal skeleton to implement the activities
of the <a href="/about/team.html">team</a>.</p>

<p>The association is a charitable, registered association ("e.V.")
under German law with the following constitution:</p>

</ul>

<h3>The Chapters</h3>

<p>Chapters are modular, local legal bodies of the FSFE, formed by the
members of the FSFE from that country and sometimes guest
members from other countries. Their main function is to receive
deductible donations, where possible.</p>

<p>Chapters are integrated throughout the FSFE with their statutes,
giving the national teams of FSFE the freedom and autonomy to address
the local issues in the way appropriate for the cultural and social
identity in those countries.</p>

<p>The constitution for these chapters is usually found by modifying
a "template constitution" in order to fit in with the legal system of
that country, aiming for charitable status whenever possible.</p>

<p>That template constitution is also available:</p>
<ul>
<li>English: <a href="/about/legal/Constitution-CTmpl.en.pdf">PDF (64k)</a><a href="/about/legal/template-constitution.en.html">HTML</a></li>
<li>German: <a href="/about/legal/Constitution-CTmpl.de.pdf">PDF (66k)</a><a href="/about/legal/template-constitution.de.html">HTML</a></li>
</ul>
