    “[T]he book [is] actually more than a fairy tale about software, 
    skateboards and pyramid-shaped ice cream with coloured sprinkles. 
    It is a motivation for the first demo and a little bit of civil 
    disobedience.  It is a utopia of possibilities to make the world 
    better with limited means and little money, and an example without 
    moralistic finger-pointing, that control does not make happy.”
