            The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) brings together dedicated 
            and engaged activists from all over Europe to seize the opportunities 
            to secure our rights to use, share, study, and improve software because 
            without Free Software, technology subjugates us instead of enhancing 
            our freedom.
