<strong>Paris, France - Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - A workshop is going
to happen during the <a href="http://lsm.abul.org/">Libre Software
Meeting</a> (Bordeaux, France - from July 4 to July 8, 2001) as part
of the theme <a
href="http://lsm.abul.org/program/topic16/topic16.php3">""Law,
Economy, Politics and Free Software"</a>, which will permit every
people involved with the translation/adaptation effort of <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a> to French to
meet and discuss together.</strong>

<p/>

More than two months after its creation, the <a
href="http://france.fsfeurope.org">FSFE France</a> (along with its
associated organizations) has been working to initiate the fundamental
activities which will permit to reach the common objectives of the FSF
and the FSF Europe --- to provide Free Software to anybody for any use
and to <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/law/law.en.html">protect the
existence of Free Software</a> whenever it faces a threat.

<p/>

In the frame of the licenses, protecting the GNU GPL is only a matter
of using good language and legal formulations. There is no need to
revise nor modify the concepts or the basis of the licenses. The
translation/adaptation effort <a
href="http://france.fsfeurope.org/gpl/gpl.en.html">has already begun in
France</a>.

<p/>

For the LSM, the FSFE France is pleased to announce that, as part of
the theme "Law, Economy, Politics and Free Software", two work
sessions will take place on <a
href="http://lsm.abul.org/program/topic16/topic16.php3">Friday, July
6, 2001</a> about the translation/adaptation of the GNU GPL to the
French legal system with the attending of Professor <a
href="http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/">Eben Moglen</a> (Professor of
Law and Legal History at Columbia Law School, general attorney of the
FSF and co-author of the GNU GPL), of Mélanie Clément-Fontaine
(Phd student in Intellectual Property Rights, author of a <a
href="http://www.crao.net/gpl">study of the GNU GPL</a> and
responsible for the adaptation project for the FSFE France), of Dan
Ravicher (attorney involved with the legal aspects of Free Software,
see <a
href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/06/05/122240&amp;mode=thread">interview on Slashdot</a>), and of members of the CNRS.
