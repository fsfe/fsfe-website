    <body>
      <p>
      The first Franconian Fellowship meeting takes place on 24 March 2007 in
      Forchheim.  We meet at 16:00 in the restaurant "Roter Ochs".  Jutta
      Horstmann speaks about Content Management Systems, Rainer Kersten from
      FSFE's office will give some info about FSFE, and the following
      discussion will certainly be interesting :-).
