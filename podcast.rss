  Software Freedom Podcast #2 about KDE with Lydia Pintscher
</h1><p>
 We are back with the second episode of our Software Freedom Podcast! 
 Once a month, we talk with people who have inspiring ideas about 
 software freedom. In this episode, we talk with Lydia Pintscher from 
 KDE about the development of the KDE community, the different KDE projects 
 and the issues they will be tackling over the next two years. 
</p><p>
 When we were planning this second episode of the Software Freedom Podcast,
 we were keen on inviting someone from the Free Software community. We 
 thought that Lydia, as the current Vice President of KDE, would be the 
 perfect person to join us for our second episode. This gives us the chance 
 to introduce to you the wonderful KDE community and all its different projects. 
 In this episode, we talk about how Lydia balances her day job with the 
 volunteer position of vice president of KDE. We also discuss some broader 
 topics like the development of the KDE community and the different projects 
 they are working on, as well as the future outlook of these projects.

Once a month, we talk with people who have inspiring ideas about software freedom. In this third episode, our guest is Harald Welte, Free Software programmer and activist. Harald discusses with us his current projects regarding mobile phone communication and the general status of Free Software in this area. 
</p><p>
One of the main topics this year was and still is the coming implementation of the 5G standard. There were long debates, and several countries have taken steps to ban specific vendors. These countries are even trying to convince others to do likewise.  To allow enough room for this broad issue and include an expert's point of view, we dedicate a full Software Freedom Podcast episode to discuss this with Harald Welte. Harald is a Free Software developer known for his involvement in OpenMoko, the first Free Software phone; his work for gplviolations.org to make sure companies adhere to the obligations of Free Software licenses; and nowadays his work on the umbrella project "Open source mobile communications", or Osmocom for short.  Together with Harald, we give you an overview of the use of Free Software in mobile phone communication; talk with you about the basics of this technology; about the difference of 3G, 4G, and 5G; the Huawei ban and <a href="https://osmocom.org/">Osmocom</a>; as well as about the state of Free Software in those fields.</p><p>Read more:</p><ul>

  Software Freedom Podcast #1 on Day Against DRM with Cory Doctorow
</h1><p>
  We have a Podcast! Starting with this episode, we will talk once a
  month with people who have inspiring ideas about software freedom. In
  our first episode of our Software Freedom Podcast, we address the
  issue of Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) together with Cory
  Doctorow, a British-Canadian writer, political activist, and
  co-editor of the blog boingboing.net. Cory Doctorow is a prominent
  supporter of software freedom and a less restrictive copyright law.
  His books are published under Creative Commons licenses.
</p><p>
  When we planned the first episode, we exchanged some ideas for
  possible guests. When we heard that the <a href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/dayagainstdrm/2019">Day
  Against DRM</a> will take place in October we thought: we have to get
  Cory Doctorow as our first guest on Digital Restrictions Management.
  In this episode of the Software Freedom Podcast, we talk about the
  difference between books and an e-books with DRM, how authors and
  artist can make money without DRM, security implications of DRM,
  regulation of the so called "Internet of Things", and other questions
  related to this issue.
