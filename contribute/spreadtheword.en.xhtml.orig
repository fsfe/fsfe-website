		<div id="introduction">
		
		  <p>You found your way here, because - like us - you care about Free Software and digital civil rights. We need your help to spread the word about the advantages of Free Software, and to explain others why they should care about Freedom, too. Advocating for Free Software is fun and arguably one of the best ways to help the Free Software movement! On this page you find various material to support and help you in spreading the word: graphics to use, leaflets to print yourself and professional promotion material to order.</p>

			<p>Are you going to a Free Software meeting or you even organise one? Maybe you like to promote Free Software and the work of the FSFE around your friends and colleagues? You want to distribute it in your company, school, university, or at your public library. Or maybe you like to do something completely different? Whatever it might be, we will be happy to send you our printed promotion material for no cost. To find the material that fits best your needs, you find an overview about our material as well as details about each product below. You might either order a default promotion package or individual quantities. Material and shipping is for free, please find all details below.</p>

    <!-- Merge with above paragraph <p>There are various reasons why and when you might like to receive promotion material for Free Software and the FSFE. Maybe you know a location (e.g. a Hackerspace, a youth club, your office...) where you would love to see information about our mission? Or you would like to tell someone (e.g. your friends, your family, your colleagues...) about Free Software, the FSFE and what we are doing? Or you are even planning a public activity (e.g. a booth, a meeting, a conference...) to promote FSFE and its goals? These are just some examples for the various usage of our promotion material. Please, feel free to decide for yourself when, why and for what you would like to use it. </p> -->
