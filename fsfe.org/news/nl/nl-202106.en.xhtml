	<p>
		Dutch digital public services rely increasingly on monopolistic 
		companies; the FSFE Dutch team actively demands digital rights. In 
		June, we launched REUSE Booster to share legal advice with Free 
		Software projects on copyright. We interviewed Torsten Grote, a 
		member of the FSFE, who stressed the need to Free our Androids 
		early on.

<h2 id="dutch-digital-autonomy-is-undermined-demands-for-free-software-are-rising">Dutch Digital Autonomy is undermined; demands for Free Software are rising </h2>
    
	<p>
		The Netherlands is becoming dependent on a digital 
		infrastructure that is dominated by a small number of monopolistic 
		companies. Although the Dutch Cyber Security Council recognises the 
		consequent risk, their report neglects focusing on Open Standards 
		and Free Software, the proven best practices to face this problem. 
		The FSFE calls on the Dutch government to stand firm and <a href="/news/2021/news-20210521-01.html">get a grip on their digital 
		security and autonomy by adhering to Open Standards and Free 
		Software</a>, in line with their earlier commitment to use Free 
		Software by default.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our team emphatically defends digital rights in the Netherlands. In 
		2018, Jos van den Oever noticed that the 'Debat Direct' app 
		could not be downloaded to his Firefox OS phone. In other words, the 
		official application for parliamentary debates was not available under 
		a Free Software license. Jos' request to get the app's source 
		code was denied, and he brought the case to court. The Council of State 
		ruled on 31 March 2021 that the Parliament does not have to publish the 
		source code. As a result, the <a href="/news/2021/news-20210611-01.html">participation app remains 
		closed</a> to those who wish to use only Free Software apps.
	</p>
	<p>
		Jos van den Oever, the person behind this initiative, is a 
		FSFE volunteer and part of our country team Netherlands.  Its 
		members kept in touch even during the pandemic, when they had to 
		replace booths for online meetings. Nico Rikken, one of the two 
		coordinators, shares his experiences about this transition in a 
		blogpost, and <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/nico.rikken/2021/06/23/how-the-netherlands-group-grew-in-covid-times/">calls 
		anyone interested to join the FSFE community based in the 
		Netherlands</a>.

<h2 id="reuse-booster-supports-free-software-projects-with-licensing">REUSE Booster supports Free Software projects with licensing</h2>

	<p>
		REUSE has facilitated the licensing of Free Software projects. 
		Developers are given standardised ways to mark all files in a 
		project with their chosen license and copyright notice. A 
		tutorial, a set of FAQs, a helper tool, and an API have been 
		made available to lower the threshold and save time.
	</p>

	<p>
		With REUSE Booster, the FSFE takes this initiative a step 
		further. <a href="/news/2021/news-20210609-01.html">Free 
		Software projects can seek tailored support</a> with licensing 
		and copyright by legal experts now. Each project will be 
		evaluated individually and the recommendations will apply to 
		its particular situation. <a href="https://reuse.software/booster/">Register</a> until 8 
		July to get your Free Software project on board.

	<p>
		In our fourth birthday publication we reminisce about the 
		emergence of the first smartphones. We are <a href="/news/2021/news-20210625-01.html">interviewing</a> 
		Torsten Grote, who explored Free Software alternatives for 
		smartphones as early as 2012. A programmer as well as a Free 
		Software activist, Torsten shares his memories of the 
		developments of alternative operating systems and applications 
		for smartphones. Finally, we would not miss this chance to ask 
		him what options there are today for liberating our phones.

		The biggest financial impact the FSFE faces in these times of physical
