	<h1>FTF: Fiduciary Programme</h1>

<localmenu/>

<p>The FTF can act as the legal guardian of Free Software projects. The FSFE Fiduciary Programme allows projects to use the <a href="fla.html">Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA)</a> to assign copyrights to FSFE, allowing the consolidation and effective management of their copyright status. This allows developers to focus on making great applications, without worrying about legal stuff.</p>

<p>Our approach can be summarised in a sentence.  The FTF makes sure projects are in a strong legal position without being prescriptive; we don't dictate project policy or project management. Our job is to make sure you can do your job.</p>

<p>The details of our <a href="guidelines.html">fiduciary selection process</a> and our <a href="fiduciary-policy.html">policies</a> are available for review.</p>

<p>You can also adapt the Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA) to consolidate your copyright under your own administrative umbrella.  We have a page containing customisable versions of the FLA <a href="fla.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like more information about our fiduciary programme please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
