  <p>
	  &quot;Software Freedom in Europe&quot; is the yearly report of the Free 
	  Software Foundation Europe e.V. (FSFE). Here you can have an 
	  overview of our work and achievements during the past year.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	  As explained below by Matthias Kirschner, President of the FSFE, our work covers three areas: Policy Advocacy, Legal area, and Public Awareness.

<h2>Summary</h2>
    
  <p>
	Cancelling of large events, limitations in meetings, and travel 
	restrictions: none of this stopped the FSFE from advancing Software 
	Freedom in 2021. From giving online 'Public Money? Public Code!' 
	workshops to volunteers, to organising an online Legal and 
	Licensing Workshop for legal experts, we kept empowering the Free 
	Software community. We assisted software projects become REUSE 
	compliant with our new initiative, REUSE Booster.
  </p>

  <p>
	We created an interactive map to demonstrate the developments of 
	Router Freedom rights in Europe. And we defined sustainable 
	software, presenting suggestions and demands to support it. 
	Meanwhile, a two-year court case initiated by FSFE supporter Luca 
	Bonissi successfully came to an end, unequivocally recognising the 
	right to a Windows licence refund. Overall, significant 
	accomplishments for Software Freedom marked 2021, the year FSFE is 
	celebrating its 20th anniversary.

  <h3 id="20-years-fsfe">20 Years FSFE</h3>

  <p>
      The FSFE was founded in <a 
      href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2001q2/000003.html">April 
      2001</a>, so in April 2021 we started having a look <a 
      href="/activities/20years/20years.html">at  our community and previous work</a>.

<h2 id="1-pmpc">1. Public Money? Public Code!</h2>

<h3 id="public-health-related-apps-must-be-free-software">Demanding Free Software in Public Health related apps</h3>

  <p>
	  Amid the difficulties of the pandemic, the FSFE identifies a 
	  crucial aspect; that apps related to public health should be Free 
	  Software. This way they will be transparent, trustworthy, and 
	  available to people who consciously avoid proprietary software. 
	  Throughout this challenge <a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20200402-02.html">our demands are 
	  consistent</a>, and this is reflected in our work. In December of 
	  2020, the FSFE stood in favour of coronavirus tracing apps to be 
	  Free Software and thanked the volunteers who <a 
	  href="https://codeberg.org/corona-contact-tracing-germany/cwa-android">liberated</a> 
	  the German Corona Warn app (CWA). The FSFE <a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20201208-01.html">appealed</a> to 
	  governments and administrations to publish developed software as 
	  Free Software, to break dependencies on Google&#39;s and 
	  Apple&#39;s app stores and instead make their apps installable 
	  from independent sources like F-Droid, and to renounce 
	  proprietary dependencies. This also helps to protect fundamental 
	  rights such as the right to privacy.
	</p>

	<figcaption>Example of Corona Tracing app</figcaption>
  </figure>
	 
	<p>
	  In August 2021, we witnessed the same 
	  problematic pattern in Germany: volunteers once more had to step 
	  in to take over the government&#39;s task in order to make the 
	  CovPass app available to everyone. The FSFE <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210830-01.html">urges</a> 
	  the government to quickly adapt its practices and make sure 
	  everyone can use such apps without any restrictions from the 
	  start. Furthermore, if ensured that solutions are published as 
	  Free Software, they can be adjusted and reused by other 
	  institutions around the world.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="eu-open-source-strategy-what-happened-in-the-eu">Examining the EU Open Source Strategy</h3>

  <p>
	  On October 21st 2020, the European Commission approved the new 
	  Open Source Software Strategy 2020-2023. On March 2021, we <a 
	  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB9Wga-AaHk&amp;list=PL1e89M45YLytKFFCu_SeeV4Ld2iPdDAoj&amp;index=2">interviewed</a> 
	  Evangelos Tsavalopoulos on this and asked the most important 
	  questions about this strategy.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Preventing a Radio Lockdown</h3>
  
  <p>
	  Since 2015, we have been monitoring the possible unpleasant 
	  effects of the European Radio Equipment Directive which we coined 
	  <a href="/activities/radiodirective/">Radio Lockdown</a>. 
	  Although the FSFE has warned the European Commission multiple 
	  times of the disastrous consequences Article 3(3)(i) can have for 
	  users, organisations, and the whole communication equipment 
	  market, the regulators did not give in. However, in the recent 12 
	  months the Commission did not propose any concrete draft 
	  regulations, so we are in a limbo. The FSFE will continue to 
	  monitor the situation closely.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="pmpc-workshops">Offering PMPC Workshops</h3>

  <p>
	  In the framework of its campaign &quot;Public Money? Public 
	  Code!&quot; the FSFE has launched a new workshop named <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/ContactingAdministrationsForPMPC">Contact 
	  your administrations</a>. Its target audience are volunteers and 
	  supporters from all over Europe who want to become active in 
	  reaching out their local representatives. This workshop aims to 
	  share best practices when addressing public administrations to 
	  discuss Free Software in the Public Sector, while empowering 
	  volunteers to become more active within their own communities. 
	  During 2021, Lina Ceballos, FSFE Project Manager, held two 
	  sessions online of this workshop for our Italian and Spanish 
	  communities.
  </p>

<h3 id="suggesting-improvements-to-the-german-warning-system-">Suggesting improvements to the German warning system</h3>

  <p>
    Already in November 2020, the FSFE flagged that <a 
	href="/news/2020/news-20201112-01.html">Germany's warning system is 
	unstable and ineffective</a> and pointed out pragmatic improvements 
	that can guarantee that a warning message can reach every person 
	needed while respecting software freedom and privacy. 
	Unfortunately, our suggestions have not been implemented in time: 
	the German warning system once again failed in July 2021 during a 
	number of heavy regional floodings, after which the FSFE <a 
	href="https://www.thelocal.de/20210730/germany-knew-its-disaster-warning-system-wasnt-good-enough-why-wasnt-it-improved-2/">reminded</a> 
	that the more effective alternatives must be adopted as soon as 
	possible to prepare for the next serious events. The commentary 
	received several republications. 
	Since this wake-up call, it seems the responsible administrations 
	have been giving this crucial change the necessary attention and 
	traction.
  </p>

<h3 id="conceptualising-a-code-repository-for-the-public-sector">Conceptualising a code repository for the public sector</h3>

  <p>
	  Together with our associated organisation the Open Source 
	  Business Alliance, the federal working group of municipal IT 
	  service providers and other experts, FSFE has developed a first 
	  concept for a code repository for the public sector. There, we 
	  clarified the potential of Free Software (<a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20200910-01.html">EN</a>, <a 
	  href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/papers/20200910-Ein-Ort-fuer-oeffentlichen-Code.v1.pdf">DE</a> 
	  for use in public institutions and how such a repository can 
	  contribute to the further development of the digitalisation of 
	  administrations. This concept is already being tested with a 
	  pilot project in the German states of <a 
	  href="/news/nl/nl-202103.html">North Rhine-Westphalia and 
	  Baden-Württemberg</a>.
  </p>

<h3 id="free-software-international-development-cooperation">Promoting Free Software in International Development Cooperation</h3>

  <p>
	  In December 2020, the FSFE published an <a 
	  href="/freesoftware/developmentcooperation/index.html">analysis</a> 
	  on the benefits of using Free Software in international 
	  development cooperation. In this increasingly digitised sector, 
	  Free Software is becoming an indispensable fundamental technology 
	  that guarantees legally compliant international cooperation and 
	  reuse. With Free Software, global scaling is possible, as well as 
	  local adaptability. New monopolies and dependencies are avoided, 
	  which is a major UN sustainability goal.
  </p>

<h3 id="sustainability">Connecting Free Software to Sustainability</h3>

  <p>
	Erik Albers, Sustainability Program Manager of the FSFE, published 
	an <a 
	href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">article 
	on the Sustainability of Free Software.</a> It summarizes 
	sustainable aspects of Free Software and political demands by the 
	FSFE taken from these findings. It was written in preparation of an 
	upcoming campaign about Upcycling Android. Erik Albers also gave a 
	<a 
	href="https://media.ccc.de/v/wk04-7557-von-freier-software-zu-nachhaltiger-software-und-wieder-zurck">talk</a> 
	(DE) about the subject of software sustainability at this 
	year&#39;s winterkongress and in the second .round table <a 
	href="https://www.greens-efa.eu/en/article/event/how-do-we-shape-and-grow-a-green-tech-sector">&quot;How 
	do we shape and grow a green tech sector?&quot;</a>, organised by 
	the Greens/EFA in the European Parliament. In February, said Author 
	co-published the <a 
	href="https://www.oekologisches-wirtschaften.de/index.php/oew/article/view/1788">research</a> 
	&quot;Design Options for Long-lasting, Efficient and Open Hardware 
	and Software&quot; in &quot;Ökologisches Wirtschaften: 
	Digitalisation and Sustainability&quot;. In January we <a 
	href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12797-Designing-mobile-phones-and-tablets-to-be-sustainable-ecodesign/F1465695_en">participated</a> 
	in the European Comission&#39;s consultation about &quot;Designing 
	mobile phones and tablets to be sustainable – ecodesign&quot;.
  </p>

<h3 id="electoral-activities">Running Electoral activities</h3>

  <p>
	  Prior to the German elections we raised our <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210427-01.html">PMPC demand</a>, in line 
	  with our <a href="/activities/elections/index.html">electoral 
	  activities</a>. During the final week before the German federal 
	  election we reached out to politicians asking their stance on 
	  Free Software. The FSFE and the OSB Alliance conducted <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210920-01.html">interviews with 
	  representatives of five German political parties</a> (DE) . The 
	  videos are available in German. Also we released our <a 
	  href="https://digitalezivilgesellschaft.org/digitalvisionen/">vision 
	  for the upcoming decades and concrete demands for the next 
	  government</a> and analyzed the <a 
	  href="https://digitalezivilgesellschaft.org/wahlpruefsteine/oeffentliches-gut/">elections 
	  programs</a> of the parties.
  </p>

  
<h3 id="spreading-the-word">Spreading the word</h3>

  <p>
	  In 2021 we translated our &#39;Public Money? Public Code!&#39; 
	  video in <a href="https://publiccode.eu/sv/#about">Swedish</a>, 
	  <a href="https://publiccode.eu/nl/#about">Dutch</a>, and Spanish. 
	  Apart from those translations, the PMPC video is available in 
	  English, German, French, Italian, Portugese, Russian, and 
	  Slovenian.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="bringing-free-software-to-local-governments">Bringing Free Software to local governments</h3>

  <p>
	The transition to a Free Software framework is often starting at 
	the level of municipalities. On May 2021, we contributed to a 
	report on the use of Free Software in <a 
	href="https://www.kgst.de/documents/20181/34177/KGSt-Bericht-5-2021_Open-Source.pdf/994d10d0-ec25-f8ed-91af-1a12518c27d3">local 
	administrations</a> (DE) which was released by the German 
	association for municipal government.
  </p>
  <p>	
	With an overwhelming 
	cross-faction majority, <a href="/news/2021/news- 
	20210331-01.html">Dortmund</a> committed itself to the use of 
	Free Software in a groundbreaking <a 
	href="/news/2021/news-20210331-01.html">resolution</a> 
	(DE) in February 2021. The case of Dortmund, where the motion 
	passed unanimously, proves that all sides can appreciate the 
	practical benefits of Free Software. The result was made possible 
	by the consistent efforts of the DO-FOSS initiative, which also 
	supported the &quot;Public Money? Public Code&quot; campaign of the 
	FSFE. The Council&#39;s decision means that there is now the 
	political backing to gradually break down dependencies on 
	proprietary vendors. The FSFE will accompany the implementation and 
	at the same time call on other administrations in Germany and 
	Europe to follow Dortmund&#39;s example.
  </p>	
  
  <p>	
	The Swiss canton of <a 
	href="/news/2021/news-20210318-01.html">Bern</a> 
	embraced Free Software and the FSFE met online with the people 
	behind this process. Bern followed the steps of another Swiss 
	canton, Uri, trailbrazer for the use of Free Software in 
	administration. For years, the Free Software &#39;Caluma&#39; has 
	been successful in Switzerland. The example of the cantons of Uri 
	and Bern shows that the principle of &quot;Public Money? Public 
	Code!&quot; benefits everyone: citizens, the administration but 
	also the economy.

<h2 id="router-freedom-at-stake">2. Router Freedom at stake</h2>

  <p>
	  Since 2013 The FSFE has been a leading voice in promoting 
	  end-users&#39; right to use their own personal modems and 
	  routers. 2021 represented a benchmark on the implementation of 
	  this right in Europe. We put great efforts to protect router 
	  freedom on the European level. We have been involved in 
	  legislative processes and implementation of technical rules  in 
	  diverse jurisdictions in the EU. Also, we provide to communities 
	  and individuals all necessary elements to engage in initiatives 
	  so that they can push the agenda on a political level.
  </p>

  <p>
	  This year demonstrated that although the regulatory framework 
	  remains fragmented in the EU, Router Freedom is emerging as a 
	  prospective reality. We empower people to defend their right to 
	  use their own internet equipment.
  </p>

<h3 id="collecting-data">Collecting Data</h3>
  
  <p>
	  Router Freedom is undergoing a rapid development in Europe, so we 
	  created a <a 
	  href="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/router-freedom-tracker_581123#4/53.12/18.37">monitoring 
	  map</a> to help everyone keep track on the Router Freedom status 
	  in their countries.

    <figcaption>Monitoring map for Router Freedom</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
	To understand better the issues end-users are facing with ISPs&#39; 
	abusive commercial practices, we started a <a 
	href="https://survey.fsfe.org/index.php/628449?lang=en">survey</a>. 
	With this unique initiative in the EU, we aim with this research to 
	gather data about end-user experience, so we can highlight the 
	issues to regulators and decision makers. Our survey is still open 
	and you are welcome to answer our questions.
  </p>

<h3 id="informing-and-empowering-the-public">Informing and empowering the public</h3>

  <p>
	  In response to the EU reform of telecommunications law (EECC), we 
	  <a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20200601-01.html">covered</a> 
	  all the pros and cons regarding router freedom. We explained why 
	  Router Freedom is fundamental for security and privacy and 
	  summarized the current status in an <a 
	  href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-router-freedom-activity-summary.pdf">Activity 
	  Summary</a> . Router Freedom is essential for fair competition on 
	  markets and sustainability by promoting compatibility among 
	  devices and right to repair.
  </p>

  <p>
	  On March 2021, when EU countries started to implement the telecom 
	  reform, we launched an <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210330-01.html">Engagement 
	  Package</a> so that anyone can organize supporting activities 
	  for Router Freedom. The included <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters/">wiki 
	  page</a> helps the volunteers of the initiative identify 
	  interested people, collect information, and set up courses of 
	  action. We also provided instructions on how to demand 
	  implementation of measures by the NRA, how to stress the topic in 
	  media and public, which arguments can be used, and what responses 
	  can be used to possible counterarguments.
  </p>

<h3 id="pushing-the-router-freedom-demand-in-each-country">Pushing the Router Freedom demand in each country</h3>
  
  <p>
	  We followed closely the positive developments in the <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210805-01.html">Netherlands</a>, 
	  which confirmed our demands pro consumer rights. In June 2021, we 
	  talked with a representative of the <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210629-01.html">Finnish 
	  regulator</a>, who explained why Router Freedom is essential for 
	  net neutrality. Our coordinated activities in <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210505-01.html">Greece</a> 
	  in May 2021 supported the regulator&#39;s preliminary decision to 
	  secure Router freedom. We worked closely with consumer 
	  organisations and digital groups to promote and leverage the 
	  agenda, demanding clear rules for consumers, as in the beginning 
	  of the legislative process in <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210506-01.html">Austria</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
	On another hand, we have monitored issues with implementations 
	which could harm Router Freedom. We raised our concerns when <a 
	href="/news/2021/news-20210505-01.html">Germany</a> 
	decided to step back from the positive experience the country has 
	built since 2016 by allowing the national regulator to determine a 
	regulatory framework against consumers. <a href="link to be 
	determined">Latvia</a> opened an extremely dangerous precedent by 
	allowing ISPs to determine by themselves technological issues to 
	prohibit the use of personal routers.

      episode to present REUSE Booster and talk about the recent developments of the whole initiative. For example,REUSE was adopted by 
      the KDE community as the standard best practice to communicate all projects' licensing and copyright situation. To learn how a large community like KDE managed this step, we interviewed <a 
      href="/news/2020/news-20201215-01.html">Andreas 
      Cord-Landwehr</a>, long-term developer at KDE, to discuss this

<h3 id="online-legal-and-licensing-workshop">Organising the Legal and Licensing Workshop 2021</h3>

  <p>
	  We organised and supported the very first online edition of the 
	  <a href="/activities/ln/llw.html">Legal and 
	  Licensing Workshop 2021</a>. The FSFE&#39;s Free Software Legal 
	  and Licensing Workshop (LLW) has been held annually for the <a 
	  href="/activities/ln/llw.html">FSFE&#39;s Legal Network</a> 
	  since 2008, and serves as a conference for <a 
	  href="/activities/ln/ln.html">legal experts</a> in the field 
	  of Free Software to debate over issues and share best practices 
	  surrounding Free Software licenses. Instead of a physical one-time 
	  conference, this year, from March to July, LLW offered online 
	  presentations, discussion panels, and workshops continuously.
  </p>

  <p>
	  The recently concluded Google v Oracle <a 
	  href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf">case</a> 
	  in the US Supreme Court was presented in detail. The discussion 
	  focused on the case&#39;s effects for Free Software licensing, 
	  with its judgment that Google&#39;s use of Java APIs legally 
	  falls within the definition of fair use, as well as touching on 
	  some of the ramifications that might have been experienced in the 
	  Free Software legal community, had API copyright been recognized 
	  in that case.
  </p>

  <p>
	  Legal considerations of Open Hardware were discussed, examining 
	  how it differs from Free Software legal issues. The LLW provided 
	  workshops on improving the quality of Free Software licensing 
	  information, including those specific to copyleft licenses.As 
	  with all online discussions of the Legal Network and its 
	  associated events, the <a 
	  href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule">Chatham 
	  House Rule</a> applied to this year&#39;s edition of the LLW.
  </p>

  <p>
      Our plans for next year&#39;s 
      edition of the LLW is to have it again as phsical meeting to continue building a 
      robust Free Software legal community.
  </p>

	  Our &#39;I Love Free Software Day&#39;, celebrated on 14 February 
	  2021, received a lot of <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210317-01.html">attention</a>. 
  </p>

<h3 id="fosdem-legal-and-policy-dev-room-pre-fosdem">Co-organising FOSDEM Legal and Policy dev room</h3>

  <p>
	  On February 2021, the FSFE participated in <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210311-01.html">FOSDEM</a>. 
	  It was a new experience as this year it took place online. Also, 
	  the FSFE co-organised the Legal and Policy Devroom for the first 
	  time.
  </p>

  <p>
	  The first day included an <a 
	  href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/ecoss/">interview 
	  with Evangelos Tsavalopoulos from the European Commission</a>, a 
	  talk by Deb Nicholson and Hong Phuc Dang on: <a 
	  href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/avoiduscentric/">Open 
	  Source Culture is Very US-Centric, But It Shouldn&#39;t Be. How 
	  Can We Make FOSS Truly Global?</a>, and a panel discussion with 
	  Fabio Balli, Adriana Groh and Luis Falcon about the use of <a 
	  href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/healthpublicpolicy/">Free 
	  Software and open hardware in the public health sector</a>. Sven 
	  Franck shared a proposal to <a 
	  href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/fosstaxbreak/">give 
	  open source a (tax) break</a> to address the lack of a financial 
	  base for software projects. A panel discussion with John 
	  Sullivan, Miriam Ballhausen, Davide Ricci and Eilís Ní 
	  Fhlannagáin questioned <a 
	  href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/compliancepanel/">whether 
	  Present Compliance Practices Assure Software Freedom for Device 
	  Users</a>.

  <p>
	  The second day, Vittorio Bertola stressed the need for <a 
	  href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/digitalmarketsact/">dominant 
	  platforms to interoperate with third parties</a> in the context 
	  of the new European regulation &#39;Digital Markets Act&#39;. 
	  Cornelius Schumacher presented <a 
	  href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/qtproprietaryrelicensing/">how 
	  the KDE Free Qt Foundation ensures software freedom for 
	  twenty-five years</a> focusing on protecting against proprietary 
	  re-licensing. The FSFE’s Deputy Legal Coordinator, Lucas Lasota, 
	  presented the state of <a 
	  href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/netneutrality/">Router 
	  Freedom in Europe and the consequences for Free Software users 
	  worldwide</a>. A panel discussion with Giovanni Battista Gallus, 
	  Fabio Pietrosanti, Carlo Piana and Alberto Pianon dealt with <a 
	  href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/agplcompliance/">the 
	  first AGPL compliance case settled in an Italian Court</a>. The 
	  aforementioned issues were <a 
	  href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/organizerslegalpolicy/">summarised</a> 
	  by the organisers of the Legal and Policy Devroom: Max Mehl and 
	  Alexander from the FSFE, Karen Sandler and Bradley Kuhn from 
	  Software Freedom Conservancy, and Richard Fontana from Red

	  On December 2020, our Local Group Zurich members <a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20201211-01.html">received 
	  a DINAcon award</a> and we interviewed them. The local FSFE group

<h3 id="fsfe-women">FSFE Women group formed in 2021</h3>

  <p>
	  In 2021, the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Women">FSFE 
	  Women</a> group was created, to help women and everyone who 
	  identifies as a female build connections with each other while 
	  discussing technological issues. Starting out as a German 
	  speaking group, the FSFE Women turned into English in May to 
	  welcome new members from around Europe. In FSFE Women we meet 
	  every month online and cover aspects related to Free Software. In 
	  June 2021, Irmhild Rogalla gave a talk about the accessibility of 
	  video conferencing tools, supporting a conferencing platform for 
	  all. In July 2021, Bonnie Mehring presented PMPC in relation to 
	  the German elections. In August 2021, Loria presented how maps 
	  are created in a 2D workadventu.re world. The <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Women">FSFE Women</a> is open 
	  to everyone who identifies as a female and gladly welcomes new 
	  members.
  </p>

<h3 id="FSFE-teams">FSFE Teams enable volunteers to communicate</h3>

  <p>
	  From local groups to country teams our community is active in a 
	  wide range of activities. Some examples that can be mentioned 
	  here are the following. The <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Translators">FSFE 
	  Translators</a>, a crucial team for our work, met in July. The 
	  Netherlands group <a 
	  href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/nico.rikken/2021/06/23/how-the-netherlands-group-grew-in-covid-times/">grew 
	  in covid times</a>. Finally, throughout the year FSFE supprortes 
	  contribute their blogposts to <a 
	  href="https://planet.fsfe.org/">Planet</a>, where 28 blogposts 
	  appeared from March 2021 to September 2021.
  </p>
  
<h3 id="sysadmin-team-web-team">There is nothing that System Hackers cannot fix</h3>

  <p>
	The fact that you can read this report is also thanks to a few 
	volunteers we call the System Hackers. <a 
	href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/System-Hackers">This group</a> is 
	responsible for the development and maintenance of the FSFE's 
	technical infrastructure: servers, connectivity, virtual machines, 
	DNS, services, backups; a hundred of things can break in between, 
	but they keep it running. In 2021, there have too many exciting 
	changes to list them here which is why we will write a piece about 
	their activities within the next weeks.
  </p>

<h3 id="translators">Translators remove language barriers</h3>

  <p>
	  During the past year the translators team has worked tirelessly 
	  on creating new translations and improving old ones. Since 
	  November 2020, the translations team has created 376 new 
	  translations. Most of them are in Italian (189), followed by 
	  Dutch with 79 new translations. The translators team has also 
	  worked on improving the translation processes. Luca Bonissi, 
	  co-translators moderator, keeps enhancing the <a 
	  href="https://webpreview.fsfe.org/">webpreview-tool</a>, a tool 
	  that can be used for proofreading translations as well as to 
	  create new ones.
  </p>

<h2 id="7-who-we-are">7. Staffers, team, General Assembly</h2>


  <p> 
	  Besides its dedicated volunteers, the FSFE also relies on its 
	  employees for its daily operations. At the FSFE we currently 
	  employ 7 full-time staffers, 5 part-time employees, and 1 intern. 
  </p>

  <p>
	In 2021 we welcomed <strong>5 new members to our 
	workforce</strong>. Since November 2020, Linda Wagener completes 
	bookkeeping and accounting tasks, offering a helping hand when 
	needed. Lina Ceballos started her internship in the FSFE last year, 
	and after a successful circle she has now joined our permanent 
	team. Lina is a Project Manager focusing on PMPC, REUSE, and Router 
	Freedom. Also, she enables the FSFE to reach Spanish audience.
  </p>
  <p>	
	Linus Sehn is our new System Administrator; he makes sure our 
	systems run smoothly and solves any problems that come up. Since 
	May 2021, Fani Partsafyllidou is our new Project Manager and 
	Newsletter Editor, supporting the implementation of Youth Hacking 4 
	Freedom, 20 Years FSFE, and Upcycling Android. Fani makes sure that 
	the work of the FSFE is accurately communicated to our community. 
	Since September 2021, Marlene Kietreiber has been working as an 
	intern, bringing the magic of graphic design to the FSFE. Would you 
	like to join our team? We are always interested in <a 
	href="/about/jobs/internship.html">internship applications</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
	<strong>The FSFE is governed by its formal members</strong>, the <a 
	href="/about/team.html#general-assembly">&quot;General 
	Assembly&quot;</a>, who are responsible for planning, budgeting, 
	and setting the agenda, as well as electing the Executive Council 
	which currently consists of the FSFE&#39;s President Matthias 
	Kirschner, Vice-President Heiki Löhmus, and Financial Officer 
	Patrick Ohnewein.
  </p>

<h3 id="our-transparency-commitment">Committing to transparency</h3>

  <p>
	The FSFE complies with the guidelines set out by <a 
    href="https://www.transparency.de/Initiative-Transparente-Zivilg.1612.0.html">“transparent 
    civil society” by Transparency International Germany</a> with <a

  <p>
	We are currently preparing the implementation of two exciting 
	projects for the next year. Youth Hacking 4 Freedom is a coding 
	competition to inspire young people to Software Freedom. It will be 
	open to teenagers 14-18 from around Europe. Participants will compete in 
	Youth Hacking for Freedom by creating programs of their choice 
	licensed as Free Software. This hacking competition is a great 
	opportunity for young people to receive inspiration and to network 
	with important people of the field. For the winners, the cash prize 
	might turn into an investment for their own project.

  <p>	
	Upcycling Android will be a campaign with a web presence and 
	practical workshops to overcome software obsolescence on Android by 
	installing Free Software. It will aim to achieve user’s freedom and 
	care for the environment at the same time. Overall, the next year 
	of the FSFE is exciting and promising as we plan to reach out to a 
	younger audience and to highlight the importance of software 
	sustainability. If you are interested to follow our future projects
