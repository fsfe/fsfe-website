<h1>TUX&amp;GNU@school - 6th edition</h1>

<p><i>More or less regularly the column <a href=
"http://www.unormal.org/alis/tagatschool6.en.html">TUX&amp;GNU@school
[2]</a> reports about free software, a homepage on topic and an
easy to implement idea. This month I talk about <a href=
"http.//www.qcad.org/">QCad [3]</a>, a free 2D-CAD program, about
the homepage of <a href=
"http://www.schoolforge.net">Schoolforge.net [4]</a>, and about the
idea "Children make music".</i></p>

<p>Welcome to the 6th edition. Meanwhile it's about one year since
I published the first <a href=
"http://www.unormal.org/alis/tagatschool1.en.html">edition [5]</a>
of TUX&amp;GNU@school, but this is even only the 6th one. But I
wasn't able to report "every month" and that's the reason why I
altered this in the introduction to "more or less regularly". But
the attempt of reporting monthly should be sustained and when I'm
able to respect a regular respectively monthly cycle' I'll realter
the introduction. At this point I would like to refer to the new <a
href=
"/activities/education/tgs/tgs.fr.html">French
[6]</a> translation of this column. Thank you for the whole work
Anne-Marie Mahfouf, it's due to her we have another translation.
Furthermore you will be able to subscribe to our new newsletter
from now on. You find the place to subscribe and more information
on our <a href=
"/activities/education/tgs/">homepage
[7]</a>. These are the news of ourselves but now I want to move to
the this time's program introduction.</p>

<h3>QCad, a free 2D-CAD program</h3>

Up to now we introduced software for lower and middle grade at this
place. Today a programm should be mentioned which would rather be
more suitable for pupils and teachers of the upper grade.
Furthermore <a href="http://www.qcad.org">QCad [3]</a> would be
surely interesting for technical colleges and engineer schools too.
<br />
<br />
 

<p>I tested the version 1.4.7 of the March 24th, 2001 under <a
href="http://www.debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux [8]</a> testing
whereas the actual version number is 1.5.4. The author Andrew
Mustun choose the GNU GPL as the license for his program. With
Debian and Debian based distribution you can install the program
with "apt-get install qcad". With rpm based distributions you
either use the corresponding package manager or type on the command
line: "rpm -i &lt;qcad-packagename.rpm". But before I begin with
the actual introduction or inspection of the program I have to
clarify that my skills and capabilities in the CAD business aren't
good enough to become equitable to the quality and complexity of
QCad. For that reason only a short and amateurish overview at this
point. Everyone who wants to know more about it is referenced to
the <a href="http://www.qcad.org">homepage [3]</a> and the
voluminous and <a href=
"http://www.qcad.org/index.php3?body=documentation&amp;product=qcad">
multilingual documentation [9]</a>. The program also was translated
into at least a dozen different languages. At the same time this
is, beneath the setting of the unit of measurement, the first point
which you can adapt to your needs at the first start of QCad.</p>

<p><img src="./img/qcad.en.png" alt=
"Screenshot 1: QCad User Interface" width="800" height="600"
border="0" /></p>

<h5>Screenshot 1: QCad User Interface</h5>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>Thereafter you'll see the program's interface (see screenshot
1), divided into the menu and the symbol bar at the head, the
function bar at left and the layer list and the library browser at
right. If you click on a function symbol a string of subfunctions
appear whereas when you click the right button or you push the
&lt;ESC&gt; you go back to the previous functions group
respectively the base functions. Part of the base functions are:
Points, Lines, Arcs, Circles, Create Texts, Dimensions, Create
hatchings, Measure, Tag and Edit. Very positive is that when you
decided for a specific function in the middle of the bottom status
bar appears a text which explains the effects of the left and right
mouse buttons. Right of this text you see a short explanation of
the chosen function. On the left side of the status bar you'll see,
with to appropriate function, the absolute and relative coordinates
of the mouse pointer position.</p>

<p>When you know a little about the program and its features you
can begin to construct your own delineations. You can choose
prepackaged delineations und patterns out of the enclosed symbol
and delineation library. It contains some ball bearings, screws and
bicycle part drawings. What for a GNU/Linux program would QCad be
if it missed the well-known penguin TUX (see screenshot 2).
Furthermore it contains some form submittals. The symbol bar under
the actual menu encloses mainly buttons for file functions (Open,
Save, etc.), different zoom possibilities, the mandatory Undo and
Redo buttons as well as a few functions for the presentations of
the lines or the worksheet ifself.</p>

<p><img src="./img/qcad-tux.en.png" alt=
"Screenshot 2: QCad with a Tux delineation" width="800" height=
"600" border="0" /></p>

<h5>Screenshot 2: QCad with a Tux delineation</h5>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>When the mechanical engineer in spe finished her first layout
she can save it in the formats: Drawing Exchange (*.cxf), EPS
(*.eps) or Font (*.cxf). QCad can, in addition to said file formats
(except EPS), open and edit the Microstation (*.dgn) and HPGL
(*.plt *.hpgl *.inc) formats. You might get the impression that the
software is be "only" useful in technical jobs and schools whereas
it needs maybe only a brave teacher who grapples with QCad and
tries to use it in his geometry lessons.</p>

<p>As far as the introduction of the 2D-CAD software QCad. What's
left are only two things for the conclusion: Firstly, QCad was
ported on several platforms it consequently don't runs only on the
(mostly) homelike ix86 machine. And secondly, thanks a lot to
Mustun and his <a href=
"http://www.qcad.org/index.php3?body=about&amp;product=qcad">numerous
helpers [10]</a> for this wonderful piece of software.</p>

<p>But now continues to the homepage of this edition.</p>

<h3>schoolforge.net - Working together to unleash the power of open
source tools in education</h3>

<p>This time I would like to present the organisation resp. the <a
href="http://www.schoolforge.net">website schoolforge.net [4]</a>.
But because at the moment it's only available in English this
introduction shall happen based on its structure. Hence it's
divided in the following seven sections: <i>Home</i>, <i>What is
Schoolforge</i>, <i>Schoolforge Members</i>, <i>News Resources</i>,
<i>Software Resources</i>, <i>Other Resources</i> und <i>Mailing
Lists and Chat</i>. But before I begin the actual presentation I'm
used to remark that a participation with Schoolforge mandatory
requires that you resp. the contact person to Schoolforge can read
and write in English at least to some extent.</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://www.schoolforge.net">front-side
[4]</a>(see Screenshot 3) you'll not find that much but enough to
get an overview. On the upper border as on all the following sides
you see the logo of Schoolforge. Thereunder left you see the
obgligatory navigation bar mit the seven ahead called items and
thereof right the virtual content of the correspondent site. On the
first page this is a short introduction to Schoolforge followed by
the up to date news. Owns a site even more navigation items are
these likewise under the normal navigation bar. By the way
Schoolforge exists already since the 8th january 2002 which means
it's soon one and a half years old.</p>

<p><img src="./img/schoolforge.en.png" alt=
"Screenshot 3: Homepage of Schoolforge.net" width="800" height=
"600" border="0" /></p>

<h5>Screenshot 3: Homepage of Schoolforge.net</h5>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>If you are the first time on schoolforge.net you're surely
interested in the item "What is Schoolforge" which means nothing
else than, guessed right: <a href=
"http://www.schoolforge.net/what.php">"What is Schoolforge"
[11]</a>. At this place they indicate that Schoolforge is no new
organisation but quasi a umbrella organisation or a communication
channel for different groupings with the mutual goal to patronize
open ressources at school. Therefore the primary objective is not
only free software. For a future membership it's surely important
to know that you can't participate as a single person. Only
organisations can become a member. But they elect a contact person
who represents the vote for the corresponding organisation.
Generally Schoolforge tries to yoke forces, to avoid duplicative
work and to ameliorate the communication between the single
arrangements in groups. Another reference under this item are the
<a href="http://www.schoolforge.net/procedures.php">"Schoolforge
Operating Procedures" [12]</a> on the one hand which specifies what
you have to do and leave as a member and on the other hand the item
<a href="http://www.schoolforge.net/membership.php">"Becoming a
Member" [13]</a>. There is a short description where and what you
have to do to become a member.</p>

<p>At this place I would like to show a bit more detailed interest
in the "Schoolforge Operating Procedures". The membership with
Schoolforge means primary a meliorated communication whereas the
mailing lists are the central start-up. On the other hand
Schoolforge is used to be a uniform face to the outside. All
members should place links and references on their homepages as a
return service. Beneath this relatively little sanction the single
members own a little more responsibility. The corresponding contact
person resp. the whole group should actively collaborate i.e. to
post something on the mailing lists from time to time. Each and
every month they elect a new vote counter which is responsible for
the correct interpretation. Additionally another member of
Schoolforge is responsible for the website Schoolforge.net and its
maintenance. The last item I want to mention here is fact that new
ideas and projects should preferably be made public and discussed
here to avoid duplicated work and if applicable to build on already
available knowledge.</p>

<p>When you follow the third link in the navigation bar you arrive
at a site where all <a href=
"http://www.schoolforge.net/members.php">members in alphabetical
order [14]</a> are listed. At the top you'll also find a link which
directs you to a somehow more <a href=
"http://www.schoolforge.net/members1.php">detailed list of members
[15]</a>. Currently these are more than 140 organisations. On the
page of the <a href="http://www.schoolforge.net/news.php">"News
Resources" [16]</a>are links to websites which regularly offer news
on topic. Some of them are e.g. <a href=
"http://opensourceschools.org">Opensourceschools.org [17]</a> as a
little journal, <a href="http://www.seul.org/edu">seul.org/edu
[18]</a> who publishes a <a href=
"http://www.seul.org/edu/reports.html">report [19]</a> every two
weeks or as well as <a href=
"http://www.schoolforge.net/sfdiscuss.php">schoolforge own mailing
lists [20]</a>. The <a href=
"http://www.schoolforge.net/software.php">"Software Resources"
[21]</a> too contain mostly links to corresponding projects whereas
I would like to mention to following ones in extracts: the <a href=
"http://richtech.ca./seul">application index [22]</a> of <a href=
"http://www.seul.org/edu">SEUL/edu [17]</a>, the <a href=
"http://www.debian.org">Debian [7]</a> subproject <a href=
"http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-jr">"Debian Jr." [23]</a> and
the <a href="http://edu.kde.org">KDE Edutainment project [24]</a>
whose contact person to Schoolforge is responsible for the <a href=
"/activities/education/tgs/tgs.fr.html">French
translation of "TUX&amp;GNU@school" [6]</a> by the way. On the left
of the page for the "Software Resources" there is still a topical
listing of the newest entries to the application database of
SEUL/edu.</p>

<p>Still some links to further interesting and helpful website on
topic are on the second last item under <a href=
"http://www.schoolforge.net/other.php">"Other Resources" [25]</a>.
Inherent are the <a href=
"http://richtech.ca/seul/casedex.html">database with success
stories resp. case studies of Linux at school [26]</a>, a <a href=
"http://seuldat.seul.org">link collection on topic [27]</a> and an
<a href="http://seuldat.seul.org/npo/">open database of Needs,
Problems and Opportunities (NPO) in usage of technology in
education [28]</a>. And finally on the last item you can find <a
href="http://www.schoolforge.net/sfdiscuss.php">information to the
mailing lists [20]</a> whereas there is a link to the online
archive too. Furthermore there is specified how, when and where
it's possible to meet people on the IRC.</p>

<p>Well this was a short presentation of Schoolforge an IMHO (in my
humble opinion) very useful organisation on topic "GNU/Linux at
school" but now proceed to the idea of this edition.</p>

<h3>"Children make music"</h3>

<p>Until now at this place I introduced a little idea which could
be implemented by a clever programmer in zero time. But at the
moment I'm not sure if this is still of interest because I didn't
receive any implementations for the last few ideas. Were the ideas
too banal, too difficult, wasn't it interesting or what do you
think about it ? Please send me your opinions and ideas about this
to <a href="mailto:foxman@lugo.ch">[1]</a>. But even more
interesting and important for me would be if the ideas and wishes
were right out of the practice, i.e. from teachers, tutors and
instructors who teach themselves and know what they miss.</p>

But nonetheless here is this edition's idea which came to me when I
played with <a href=
"http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint">Tuxpaint [29]</a> <a
href="http://www.unormal.org/alis/tagatschool5.de.html">[30]</a>.
Surely all of you who already tried out Tuxpaint know that some
stamps have sounds and noises associated with them. When you now
click more than one time on the corresponding symbol and in a
moment include several other stamps from time to time an
interesting tone pattern appears. It would surely be quite simple
to write out of this idea a short program that contains several
buttons. These buttons would be underlied by different sounds and
noises on which you could click on the top of one's bent. A
recording function would round off this idea and give the Mozarts
and Beethovens of tomorrow another useful tool. <br />
<br />
 

<p>I'd be glad to hear some noises come out of this corner and
going on now to the news of this edition.</p>

<h3>News and up to date program versions</h3>

<h4>FREEDUC published in version 1.3</h4>

<p>A few weeks ago the version 1.3 of <a href=
"http://www.ofset.org/projects/edusoft/edusoft.html">FREEDUC
[31]</a> was released. FREEDUC is a Distribution based on the
well-known <a href="http://www.knoppix.de">Knoppix [32]</a> whose
main purpose is the demonstration of free educational software.
Which software exactly you'll find on it is written <a href=
"http://www.ofset.org/projects/edusoft/packages.txt.gz">here
[33]</a> (Attention: *.txt.gz file).</p>

<h4>Linux certificates for Austrian pupils</h4>

<p>Since the first <a href=
"http://www.pressetext.at/pte.mc?021206035">publication [34]</a>
already some time went by but even though I would like to mention
it here once more. At Austrion schools now it seems to be possible
to make resp. receive a GNU/Linux certification.</p>

<h4>www.BSI-fuer-Buerger.de launched</h4>

<p>Some weeks ago the German <a href="http://www.bsi.de">BSI -
Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechologie
[35]</a> (Federal Office for information technology security)
launched a new <a href="http://www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de">information
site [36]</a> <i>(German only)</i> for their citizens. The
information you can find there don't belong directly to free
software and GNU/Linux but are nonetheless very interesting and
easy to understand. They explain you common terms as "internet" and
his functionality but on the other hand they show an interest in
security aspects too. At this place I would like to reference to
the IMHO ingenious simple explanation of the internet from the
"Sachgeschichten" (stories about how things work) of the German <a
href="http://www.sendung-mit-der-maus.de/">"Sendung mit der Maus"
[37]</a> (telecast for children in the German tv). You can download
this short and quite easy comprehensible movie <a href=
"http://www.wdrmaus.de/service/download/?lang=de/">here
[38]</a>.</p>

<h4>GCompris with new major release</h4>

<p>Foremost a few weeks ago Bruno Coudoin released version 3.0
followed by GCompris 3.1 some days ago. The most important changes
are the bypassing of error of the gnome-canvas library which wasn't
remedied until then and the possibility to write new boards in
python. Furthermore there are some new boards as with each new
version of course. You can find the exact details on the Homepage
of <a href="http://www.ofset.org/gcompris">GCompris [39]</a>. Right
here I wouldn't like to omit to congratulate Bruno to his <a href=
"http://www.sil-centril.org/trophees/projecst/educ.html">success
[40]</a> at the <a href=
"http://www.tropheedulibre.org">TropheeduLibre.org [41]</a>. Go
on.</p>

<h4>KTouch with new version</h4>

<p>KTouch is available in a new version too since a few weeks that
is to say 1.3. You can extract the exact changes and features on
the <a href="http://ktouch.sf.net">homepage [42]</a>.</p>

<h4>SkoleLinux as prerelease38</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.skolelinux.no">SkoleLinux [43]</a> is a
Debian based distribution from norway which is specifically made
for education purposes. Meanwhile there is also a <a href=
"http://www.skolelinux.de">German homepage [44]</a> and a German
team which adapts the distribution to the local conditions.
Unfortunately there is no stable release till now of this promising
distribution. Nonetheless they released the preversion pre38 for
testing some weeks ago. By the way SkoleLinux the first
distribution I know that productively uses the new <a href=
"http://people.debian.org/~mckinstry/ports-status.html">Debian-Installer
[45]</a>.</p>

<h4>Up to date program versions</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://edu.kde.org/ktouch">KTouch</a> 1.3 - Type
writing course under KDE 3.1.2 (<a href=
"http://www.unormal.org/alis/tagatschool1.en.html">TGS 1</a>)</li>

</ul>

<br />
<br />
 

<p>And at the end and before I'll forget it: This is the first
version of TUX&amp;GNU@school which is also available as OGG
Vorbis, Wave and MP3 <a href=
"/activities/education/tgs/">[7]</a> ;-) Go
and listen to it. Bye and till the next time ...</p>
