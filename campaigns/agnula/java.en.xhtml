<h1>Java Issues</h1>
</center>

<p>The goal of the AGNULA project is to create an entirely Free
Software GNU/Linux distribution for professional audio users. When
setting out with this goal, we didn't know how far we would come, but
it turns out that it is indeed possible. As it so often is the case,
one problem remains to be solved.</p>

<h3>Java issues</h3><ul>

<p>The "Java issues" often mentioned in several places is not a
technical problem of Java as a programming language. It is rather in
the way Java is being developed and maintained as a proprietary
operating base.</p>

<p>There are two major Java implementations currently in use, one
maintained by IBM, the other by Sun. Both of them may come without
charge, but are without the freedom that would make them qualify as <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free
Software</a>.</p>

<p>Consequently, all software written in Java &#8212; even software
under a Free Software license, such as the GNU General Public License
(GPL) or the BSD license &#8212; running on such a platform will put
the users freedom at risk. A situation quite comparable to Free
Software running on Microsoft Windows.</p>

<p>Alternative approaches to provide Free Software Java platforms
exist, but due to the proprietary nature of the Java implementations,
Free Software needs to re-engineer what the proprietary platforms have
implemented after they have been released, putting Free Software
implementations at a disadvantage. Furthermore, this is a tedious task
that not many developers wish to undertake.</p>

<p>As a result, the proprietary Java platforms tend to be more feature
rich than their Free Software counterparts, tempting programmers to
make use of their advanced features.</p>

<p>When programs make use of these advanced features, they will not
run on Free Software Java implementations. In fact they will often
only run with one of the two major proprietary implementations. A
situation comparable to Free Software that only runs on Microsoft
Windows and cannot be made to run on a Free Software operating
system.</p>

<p>If you seek more detailed information about the status of Free
Software Java implementations, the following link should be useful:</p>
<ul><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/java/">http://www.gnu.org/software/java/</a></ul>

</ul><h3>Effect on AGNULA</h3><ul>

<p>There is only one package in AGNULA that has a dependency to a
proprietary Java implementation. Unfortunately this is a very valuable
project called <a href="http://www.ircam.fr/jmax/">jMax</a>, written
by <a href="http://www.ircam.fr">IRCAM</a>, one of the AGNULA project
partners.</p>

<p>The project itself consists of a server written in C and licensed
under the GNU General Public License (GPL), and a client written in
Java, also licensed under the GNU General Public License.</p>

<p>So all that would be required is to make sure the Java client does
not have proprietary dependencies.</p>

</ul><h2>What we have tried</h2><ul>

<p>There are several possible ways to solve this problem that we have
explored:
<ul>

<li><b>Convince Sun to release their Java implementation as Free
Software</b>:<br /> Because Microsofts .NET initative seems very
likely to become the "Java killer," releasing their Java
implementation as Free Software would greatly increase Suns chances to
remain an important player in the market. Although there are some
people inside Sun who would like to do this, it appears unlikely this
will happen soon. Suns recent announcement to support Free Software
Java implementations helps, but it is not enough to solve the
immediate problem.</li><br />

<li><b>Make the jMax GUI use the GNU Java tools:</b><br /> IRCAM has
spent some time evaluating the possibilities and found that the GNU
Java Compiler (gjc) would be up to the job, unfortunately the
libraries needed for the GUI are still too rudimentary. The simplest
solution along this route would have been to add the necessary
features to GNU Classpath, a task that has been estimated with four
person-years. Unfortunately IRCAM does not have the resources to do
this and by European Commission rules, AGNULA can only finance
integration, not development.</li><br />

<li><b>Create an alternative non-Java GUI:</b><br /> Since it seems
unlikely we'll be able to stick with Java and keep the project
entirely free, the last alternative appears to be the writing of
another GUI based upon a different programming language.<br /> After
some discussion it has been decided that <a
href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> would be a good choice for a
platform independent Free Software GUI.</li> </ul></p>

</ul><h3>Creating a Python GUI for jMax</h3><ul>

<p>For the same reasons mentioned above, AGNULA cannot directly fund
development of a Python GUI, nor can IRCAM afford the resources
necessary for full development. We are determined to not fall short of
our goal, so we will not include any of the proprietary Java runtime
environments. Which is why we are asking for volunteers.</p>

</ul><h2>Call for volunteers</h2><ul>

<p>If you are a Python developer or somebody with an interest in music
applications, please help us develop <b>pyMax</b>, the Python GUI for
jMax, so we can offer this as another fully functional Free Software
audio application on AGNULA.</p>

<p>IRCAM cannot do all the work themselves, but they are willing to
offer volunteers priority support (answer time within 24hrs on working
days) and all help that they can provide.</p>

<p>Should you wish to help with this problem, please subscribe to the
IRCAM jMax development list and let people know that you want to help:
