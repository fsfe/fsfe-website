    <title>Fellowship meeting in Vienna</title>
    <body>
      On 18 July 2008, a Fellowship meeting takes place in Vienna.
      We meet around 18:00 in the bar <strong>"Käuzchen", Gardegasse 8</strong>
      (Note: changed location!). The discussions will start at 19:00.<br/>
      Items on the agenda include planning of Shane Coughlan's visit to Vienna,
      planning for the Software Freedom Concert on Software Freedom Day, and
      discussion about possible reactions on the WIENUX decision. As always,
      the meeting is ended with a nice chat over a beer.<br/>
      As usual, this invitation addresses to all people interested in FSFE or
      Free Software. We are looking forward to many attendants!
