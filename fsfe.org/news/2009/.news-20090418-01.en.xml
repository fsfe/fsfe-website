<h1>FSFE and the Fellowship reorganise their domains</h1>

<p>In the past months, the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) visibly improved the
technological infrastructure of the Fellowship. We moved the Fellows' blogging
platform to a new site, we created a Planet to aggregate the Fellows' blogs and
we provided them with an improved and functional wiki.</p>

<p>In order to make the whole Fellowship infrastructure easily accessible we also
reorganised the domains for these services.</p>

<p>Starting from today these will be the new addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Fellowship of FSFE: <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">https://my.fsfe.org/donate</a></li>
<li>The Fellows' blogs:     <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org">https://blogs.fsfe.org</a></li>
<li>The Fellowship Planet:  <a href="https://planet.fsfe.org">https://planet.fsfe.org</a> </li>
<li>The Fellowship wiki:    <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org">https://wiki.fsfe.org</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Along with the changes in the Fellowship domains, we also changed the address
of FSFE's institutional website which is now: <a href="/index.html">https://fsfe.org</a>.</p>

<p>The old fsfeurope.org address will continue to work, redirecting to our pages, but
<a href="/index.html">https://fsfe.org</a> is from now on FSFE's official address.</p>

<p>It is time to tune your bookmarks and to <strong>join the Fellowship!</strong></p>

<a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">https://my.fsfe.org/donate</a>
