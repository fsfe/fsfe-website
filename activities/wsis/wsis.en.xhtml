<h1>World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)</h1>
</center>

<p>The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was a two-summit
UN conference organised by the ITU at which important cornerstones for
the information and knowledge society should be laid. After the
summits in Geneva and Tunis, the WSIS is now in its implementation phase.</p>

<p>FSFE has been participating for many years along with other civil
societies to make sure that principles of freedom, human rights,
sharing of knowledge and access to information will be upheld.</p>

<h3>Followup-Activities</h3>

<ul>

<li><a href="/activities/igf/">Internet Governance Forum (IGF)</a><br />
One of the most controversial undertakings of the second phase of the
WSIS was the <a href="/activities/igf/wgig.html">UN WGIG</a>. Unable to
discuss and find consensus on substantive issues, in particular the
issues around monopolisation of knowledge and Free Software, the
second summit in Tunisia agreed to create an international discussion
forum on all issues internet related, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF).</li>
