    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

    <p>
      IPRED2, The second &quot;Intellectual Property&quot; Rights
      Enforcement Directive, has at it's core:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      &quot;Member States shall ensure that all intentional
      infringements of an intellectual property right on a commercial
      scale, and attempting, aiding or abetting and inciting such
      infringements, are treated as criminal offences.&quot;<br />
      (Article 3.  Page 6 of the
      text: <a
      href="http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2005/com2005_0276en01.pdf">com(2005)276</a>)
    </p>

    <p>
      The EU definition of &quot;Intellectual property&quot; lumps
      together patents, copyright, trademarks, design protections, and
      many other categories of law.
    </p>


    <h2 id="harm">Harmful effects on software freedom</h2>


    <h3 id="swpat">Software patents: Enforcement through fear</h3>

    <p>
      Although the European Patent Convention excludes software from
      patentability, the European Patent Office is granting patents on
      software ideas.  While &gt;90% of litigation based on such
      patents would fail in court, they give the patent holders a
      legal basis for threatening software producers/distributors with
      litigation.  The threat of jail time, massive fines, seizing of
      assets, and closure of business could generate enough fear among
      computer users to make people obey these invalid patents.  (For
      more on the issue of software patents, see the page
      about <a href="/projects/swpat/swpat.html">FSFE's work against
      software patentability</a>.)
    </p>


    <h3 id="models">Harm to efficient software production/distribution models</h3>

    <p>
      Greatly increasing the risks of software
      development/distribution will have a chilling effect on
      producers/distributors who operate in structures that don't
      include large legal defense funds.  Free Software, which is
      often written by individuals and by businesses whose core
      business is not software, could be particularly harmed by harm
      to these business models.
    </p>


    <h3 id="abuse">Encouragement of commercial abuse, like SCOs</h3>

    <p>
      If we give litigators increased access to national enforcement
      bodies, and if we increase the harmful effects of litigation, we
      will encourage people to use litigation as a commercial tool in
      the market.  SCO in the USA is the biggest example of this,
      without proving anything or even showing any evidence, they have
      accused IBM and others of intentional, commercial-scale
      &quot;IP&quot; infringement, and have slowed the adoption rate
      of Free Software such as GNU/Linux and harmed the reputation of
      a handful of companies (competitors to Microsoft, one of SCO's
      major funders).
    </p>


    <h3 id="indemnification">Inability to indemnify</h3>

    <p>
      Since criminal offenses cannot be indemnified against, patent
      litigation insurance would not be possible, and software
      producers could no longer indemnify distributors of their
      software.
    </p>


    <h3 id="grey-areas">Developers in grey areas: DeCSS, filesharing</h3>

    <p>
      The European Copyright Directive increased the scope of what
      copyright infringement.  As well as prohibiting unauthorised
      copyring, copyright law now prohibits how you use technology to
      access or view copyrighted works.  Developing software to watch
      a DVD that you have bought, is a copyright infringement.
      Developing software for file-sharing, could be copyright
      infringement.  The threat of jail sentences and other harsh
      measures in this directive will scare people away from writing
      or publishing many classes of legal software for tolerated
      software that is technically illegal.
    </p>



    <h2 id="text">Reading the proposal text</h2>

    <p>
      The IPRED2 proposal
      (<a
      href="http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2005/com2005_0276en01.pdf">com(2005)276</a>)
      has two parts: pages 2 to 8 of the proposal are a Directive, and
      pages 9 to 15 are a Council Framework Decision.
    </p>


    <h3 id="directive">The Directive &quot;2005/0127(COD)&quot;</h3>

    <p>
      The major problems with the Directive are Articles 3 and 4
      (pages 6 and 7 of the document).  Article 3 is quoted in
      full <a href="#summary">above</a>.  Article 4 lists the harsh
      punishments that must be made available for the to-be criminals.
    </p>


    <h3 id="framework-decision">The Council Framework Decision &quot;2005/0128(CNS)&quot;</h3>

    <p>
      The Council Framework Decision is there to give the European
      Union permission to enact a directive which requires criminal
      sanctions for &quot;intellectual property right&quot;
      infringements.  The major problems with the Framework Decision
      are in Article 4 (page 13):</p>

    <p class="quote">&quot;The Member States must ensure that the
      holders of intellectual property rights concerned, or their
      representatives, and experts, are allowed to assist the
      investigations carried out by joint investigation teams into the
      offences referred to in Article 3 of Directive
      ..../.../EC.&quot;
    </p>

    <p>
      Also scary is Article 6 (page 14) which says that Member States
      should investigate and prosecute &quot;intellectual property
      right&quot; infringements, even when the rights-holder has not
      requested it.
    </p>


    <h2 id="options">What we can lobby for</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>
	We can ask our national governments to reject the Council
	Framework Decision.  This may remove the legal foundation for
	the criminal sanctions provisions in the Directive, however
	<a
	href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1779849,00.html">a
	recent rule by the European Court of Justice suggests that it
	may not</a>.  The Framework Decision needs unanimity from the
	25 member states and is worth rejecting for other reasons
	anyway (state <a href="#framework-decision">above</a>).
      </li>

      <li>
	We can lobby the European Parliament and the Council of
	Ministers to limit criminal sanctions to cases where the
	infringement was done to fund organised crime or caused a
	health or safety risk to the public.  Organised crime and
	health and safety are stated as the justifications of this
	directive, so tying the Articles to the justifications seems
	reasonable.
      </li>

      <li>
	We can lobby the European Parliament and the Council of
	Ministers to remove the criminalisation of &quot;attempting,
	aiding or abetting and inciting [intellectual property right]
	infringements&quot;
      </li>

      <li>
	We can lobby the European Parliament to simply reject this
	Directive.
      </li>

      <li>
	We can lobby our national governments to remove Article 4 and
	Article 6 from the Council Framework Decision.  It might be
	sufficient to amend these Articles to limit them to cases
	where organised crime is being funded or there is a health or
	safety risk to the public.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      Note: Restricting the directive to organised crime and health
      and safety issues may not be sufficient in all cases.  One
      reason is that in the cases of investigation, the truth of any
      claimed links to organised crime or health or safety issues
      cannot be confirmed.  A second reason is that it mightn't
      protect against ludicrous claims that software that benefits the
      general public also benefits organised crime (e.g. file sharing
      software).
    </p>


    <h2 id="todo">Todo</h2>

    <p>
      Many Member States already have criminal sanctions for copyright
      and trademark infringement, and some even have criminal
      sanctions for patent infringement.  When politicians ask
      &quot;What harm have criminal sanctions caused in other
      countries?&quot; we need to have a list of good examples.  This
      list has to be gathered.
