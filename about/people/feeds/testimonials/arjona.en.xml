            If software is licensed as free software, we can audit it, and be sure 
            that it does what it's intended to do (and nothing else). Public 
            institutions develop software, and hire companies to make it, and the 
            citizens should own and reuse all that code. I contribute to free 
            software with translations, user help desk, finding free software 
            alternatives at the University... but I cannot reach the policy-makers, 
            nor people and institutions in other countries. I'm fellow to support 
            the FSFE doing this task, and as one more way to say thank you to the 
            free software community.
