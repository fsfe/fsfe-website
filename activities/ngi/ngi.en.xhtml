		<!-- What -->
		<p>The FSFE is a partner organisation of <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/about/ngi-zero/">NGI Zero</a>, a coalition of thirteen not-for-profit organisations from across Europe. Funded by the European Commmission, NGI Zero (or NGI0) provides grants to individual researchers and developers, as well as teams that wish to work on new ideas and technologies that contribute to the establishment of the <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/vision/">Next Generation Internet</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>What is the Next Generation Internet initiative?</h2>
		<p>The <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">Next Generation Internet</a> is a European initiative with the aim to create an internet that respects human and societal values, such as privacy, participation, and diversity. It hopes to enable new online functionalities that can support real human needs and address global sustainability challenges. To this end, NGI0 was set up within the Next Generation Internet initiative to coordinate several Research and Innovation Actions, including the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/discovery/"> NGI0 Discovery </a> and <a href="https://nlnet.nl/PET/">NGI0 PET </a> actions, run by the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLNet Foundation</a> in the Netherlands.</p>
		
		<h2>NGI0 Research and Innovation Actions: PET and Discovery</h2>
		<p>Each of these actions will support the development of technologies promoting the NGI ideals with grants funded by the European Commission over the next few years. Specifically, NGI0 PET awards grants to applicant privacy and trust enhancing technology projects, and NGI0 Discovery awards grants to applicant technology projects that enhance user access to search for and discover information on the internet.</p>

		<p>In order to be effective at internet scale, the results of these efforts are made available as free/libre/open source software.</p>

		<h2>Role of the FSFE</h2>
		<p>Generally, NGI0 will aid the approved projects in an advisory capacity with their technologies in their respective specific areas of expertise, such as security and accessibility. The FSFE in particular will provide guidance to the applicant technologies with understanding best practices for communicating the components, licenses, and copyrights associated with software packages.</p> 
		<p>This allows all software produced with these grants to be verified automatically without manual intervention, and therefore to be quickly and safely adopted by individuals, public bodies, and private enterprises of any size.</p>

		<p>Additionally, the FSFE has produced for NGI0 participants a series of documents and FAQs that explain Free Software legal and licensing issues, and how to manage these issues within a software project. These documents are also available to the general public, so if you would like to take a look at them, you can access them <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/NGI0/">here</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>Get involved</h2>
		<p>Calls for submissions to the NGI0 PET and NGI0 Discovery actions renew every 2 months.</p>

		<p>If you have an idea that contributes to the Next Generation Internet, and that relates to the topic of privacy and trust in (internet-related) technology, or to the topic of search, discovery, and discoverability, please do not hesitate to <a href="https://nlnet.nl/propose/">propose it here</a>.</p>
