      With the PDFreaders campaign we turn the spotlight on government
      organisations who advertise proprietary PDF readers, exposing how
      frequent such advertisements for non-free software are. With the
      help of activists across Europe, we contacted these organisations
      and explained to them how to improve their websites so that they
      respect our freedom. On <a
      href="https://pdfreaders.org">pdfreaders.org</a> we present Free
      Software PDF readers for all major operating systems.
