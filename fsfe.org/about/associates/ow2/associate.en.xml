        OW2's mission is to promote a code base of Free Software for corporate
        information systems and their ecosystems. They are proud  of their
        European DNA, they are EU-driven (i.e. motivated by EU interests)
        rather than EU-focused (i.e. attracted by EU market opportunities).
