<h1>Germany Stack: Only Free Software Enables Digital Sovereignty</h1>

<p>The “Germany Stack” is a central digital-policy project of the German
federal government. The FSFE calls for the Stack to be planned in close
coordination with European partners and to be implemented entirely as
Free Software, since only the four freedoms enable digital
sovereignty.</p>

<p>The Federal Ministry for Digital Affairs and State Modernisation is
working on the so-called Germany Stack, which is intended to <a href="https://deutschland-stack.gov.de/gesamtbild/">“create a sovereign, European-compatible and interoperable digital infrastructure
for federal, state and local governments” as “national sovereign technology platform”</a>. Until the end of November 2025, a public consultation is running, to which the Free Software Foundation Europe
(FSFE) <a href="https://gitlab.opencode.de/dstack/d-stack-home/-/issues/347">has today submitted a statement</a>.</p>

<p>In this statement, we call for a strategic orientation of the Germany
Stack based on the following principles:</p>
<ol>

<li>The Germany Stack must be published entirely as Free Software,
granting everyone the right to use, study, share and improve the
software. All components included must be under a Free Software
licence.</li>

<li>The Stack must be advanced in close cooperation with European
partner countries and the EU. Instead of national go-it-alone approaches
and silo stacks, we need Free Software solutions that are interoperable
across Europe.</li>

<li>Free Software requires secure, long-term budgets. Establishing
the Germany Stack must go hand in hand with strategic funding for the
development and maintenance of Free Software.</li>

<li>Beyond the state and its administrations, European companies,
civil society, and organisations from schools to volunteer fire brigades
depend on digital sovereignty. The Stack must therefore be made
available for reuse by non-state actors.</li>

</ol>

<p>Free Software is the necessary prerequisite for sovereign digital
infrastructures. Only the rights guaranteed by Free Software licences
give the state control over the digital infrastructure it relies on.
Only Free Software and open standards compatible with Free Software
enable the highest level of interoperability and security. Only in this
way can it be ensured that public authorities retain influence over the
software products they deploy, and guarantee long-term access to the
publicly funded code. Only the consistent use of Free Software enables
the German state and its administrations to overcome existing critical
dependencies on proprietary, mostly non-European software and to act in
a sovereign manner.</p>

<p>The Germany Stack can only achieve its stated aim if it consistently
relies on Free Software. A proprietary stack would merely replace
existing dependencies with new ones. Proprietary software developed by
manufacturers in Germany or Europe does not provide the necessary
conditions for sovereignty, creates new lock-in effects, and can at any
time be withdrawn from access by public authorities – for instance, if a
manufacturer becomes insolvent or is bought by a non-European
competitor. Trust issues also remain when the code is intransparent, and
security bugs may persist if there is no right to fix the software.
Defining availability as Free Software as a criterion for components of
the Stack does not disadvantage manufacturers of proprietary software.
Rather, this decision creates an incentive for all manufacturers to
produce and publish Free Software, from which not only public
administrations but also the European economy and society as a whole
will benefit.</p>

<p>Studies show that governments and public administrations account for
up to 27% of the turnover of software vendors. However, this turnover is
predominantly generated by proprietary software manufacturers outside
Europe. Strategic procurement of Free Software within the framework of
the Germany Stack, by contrast, can stimulate the European market and
industry and strengthen autonomy. A consistent use of Free Software in
the Stack also creates spill-over effects for European companies and
civil society, whose sovereignty is likewise strengthened through the
use of Free Software.</p>

<p>Further arguments for Free Software in public administrations can be
found in <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/20241204_Bundestag_Stellungnahme_FSFE.pdf">the 
FSFE’s statement submitted for the “Open Source” hearing</a> in
the German Bundestag’s Digital Committee on 04.11.2024. The <a href="https://deutschland-stack.gov.de/beteiligung/">consultation
on the Germany Stack</a> runs until 30 November 2025. Until then, everyone
has the opportunity to provide well-founded feedback on openCode.</p>
