The last month of 2007 was pretty exciting, with the
biggest news being the release of interoperability information by Microsoft in
connection with the European antitrust case. The SAMBA project has arranged
full access to specifications necessary for communication competitive
alternatives to Microsoft's proprietary products. Of course, this does not
mean that Microsoft's monopolistic behaviour has been resolved. A new
antitrust case may be undertaken after complaints by Opera Software that
Microsoft has willfully distorted the web browser marketplace. It's
also important to note that this does not in any way solve the problem
with patents on software. Such patents are still being granted by the
European Patent Office (EPO) in violation of current law, and the FSFE is
encouraging the European Commission to take actions to permanently abolish
patents on software, both in theory and practice.
