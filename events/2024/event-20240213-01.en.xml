	    <p>Are you up for a pre-"I Love Free Software Day" party? Then come and join us at the FSFE Pottieries "I Love Free Software Day" gathering. On the 13th of February, from 6:30 pm (GMT) onwards we will meet upstairs at the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/Potteries/KPA%20Clubhouse">KPA Clubhouse, 97 Horwood Road, Keele University, Keele, Staffordshire</a>. Everyone is welcome, so bring along your friends, significant other, or family of all ages!  Even if they've never heard of Free Software before, it'll be a good way to introduce them to the topic. However, please let us know when you want to join us for "I Love Free Software Day". Either by <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/potteries">subscribing</a> to our mailing list and sending us a message there or by sending us an email to <email>potteries@fsfe.org</email>.</p>
      
      <p>We look forward to seeing many of you on the 13th of February for our pre-celebrations ♥ ♥ ♥ !</p>
