<h2 id="european-parliament-recognises-free-software-as-key-for-fair-ai">European Parliament recognises Free Software as key for fair AI</h2>
  
  <p>
    The Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age 
    (AIDA) of the European Parliament voted on its resolution on 
    Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age on March 22nd, and 
    underlined the importance of Free Software for AI with a broad 
    majority. We now ask EU co-legislators to take this position into 
    account and to include provisions and guidelines on Free Software 
    in the upcoming legislation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Public authorities using AI systems should make them publicly 
    available. Public research inventing AI systems should make them 
    publicly available. Transparency in AI technologies is necessary to 
    test them, evaluate their results, and improve them. <a href="/news/2022/news-20220330-01.html">The FSFE 
    is following closely the legislative process</a> and analysed <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/AIandFS/fsfe_AIandFreesoftware.pdf">how 
    AI can remain verifiable and trustworthy as well as lead to further 
    innovation</a> with Free Software.
  </p>

<h2 id="germany-has-ambitious-free-software-plans-will-it-realise-them-">Germany has ambitious Free Software plans. Will it realise them?</h2>

  <p>
    The coalition agreement of the German government set digitisation 
    as a priority and Free Software as a secure and transparent 
    solution. 100 days into the new German government in office, no 
    action has been taken. On the contrary, German administrations are 
    alarmingly close to using Microsoft products, giving up the chance 
    to adopt a strategy based on open interfaces. Alexander Sander, the 
    FSFE's Policy Consultant, explains: "Instead of finally 
    providing a 'Free Software cloud' for administrations, the 
    new government will again rely on costly proprietary 
    applications." <a href="/news/2022/news-20220315-01.html">We call 
    upon the government to follow its own plans</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Specifically, together with other actors such as the Open Source 
    Business Alliance and the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany, the 
    FSFE demands that the German government <a href="/news/2022/news-20220328-01.html">includes 
    digital sovereignty in the 2022 federal budget</a> and implement 
    already announced initiatives for software freedom. In an <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/letters/20220328-German-Budget-and-Free-Software-2022.de.pdf">open 
    letter (DE)</a> the signatories address the government groups in 
    the Bundestag.

  <p>
    What are my options if I want to run my phone with Free Software? 
    We interviewed Plasma Mobile developer Bhushan Shah to learn more 
    about the project. Plasma Mobile is a full Linux-based system which 
    offers a completely transparent development process. When it comes to 
    privacy, Plasma Mobile is one of the most secure operating systems 
    for phones. There is no tracking, spying, nor data mining to craft 
    targeted ads. <a href="/news/2022/news-20220323-01.html">Bhushan 
    gives a clear overview of Plasma Mobile, including how it is 
    developed, and how to get it</a>.

    <a href="/news/podcast/episode-14.html">In our new 
    Software Freedom Podcast episode, Matthias Kirschner talks with our 
    guest, Elektra Wagenrad, about the origins of Freifunk, the 
    B.A.T.M.A.N. protocol, and the Mesh Potato project</a>. If you are 
    new to the world of mesh networking this episode is an easy 
    entrance to it. Elektra explains the theory behind the protocols 
    and dives deeper into its philosophical idea.

<h2 id="the-most-energy-efficient-pdf-reader-is-free-software-congrats-okular-">The most energy-efficient PDF reader is Free Software. Congrats, Okular!</h2>

  <p>
    To be exact, Okular is a universal document viewer. This means you 
    are not only able to read PDFs, comics, and EPub books, but also 
    you can browse your image files, visualize Markdown documents, and 
    much more. In February 2022, Okular was awarded the Blue Angel 
    ecolabel, the official environmental label awarded by the German 
    government. In 1978, the German Environment Agency was the first to 
    establish an environmental label; this year the label's scope 
    was extended to include software products, making Okular the first 
    Ô∏èever eco-certified computer program.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to receive the Blue Angel ecolabel, a program needs to 
    meet many requirements, including transparency, backwards 
    compatibility, and the ability to run the application on hardware 
    at least five years old. Free Software usually excels in these 
    conditions. The FSFE <a href="/news/2022/news-20220316-01.html">congratulates 
    Okular and all of the KDE community</a>!
