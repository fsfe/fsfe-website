    <h2>About Christian Holz</h2>
    
    <p>
      Christian Holz has been working in the IT and IT-related
      industries since 1989. Starting his own IT Service company while
      still in the German form of a high-school, he supported local
      businesses in the move from typewriters and photocopy machines to
      PCs and desktop publishing and eventually built and managed basic
      networks for them. Fascinated by IT and what it can do for an
      organization, he went on to study business administration with a
      strong focus on Information Systems and Software Development.
      Fresh out of university, he became the technical leader of a small
      Internet Startup called inTouch GmbH, which grew into a
      pan-European web-development and hosting company (then called
      Integra S.A. and Genuity Europe). From there he moved on to join
      PricewaterhouseCoopers' IT/IT-Security advisory practice in
      Frankfurt and Philadelphia, managing projects and supporting
      clients in tasks ranging from penetration tests and code-reviews
      all the way to outsourcing and due-diligence work.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Since 2006, Christian has been running his own company, Callowhill
      GmbH, providing IT and management consulting services. His largest
      clients included a global music publishing firm, where he started
      to understand the inner workings of copyrights and their related
      laws as well as a large pharmaceutical company that he has been
      supporting in various IT- and strategy-related projects.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Christian joined the FSFE as its Executive Director in June 2009.
