        The local group of FSFE in Berlin meets for its edu meeting on every 
        fourth Thursday of the month. All those interested in Free Software
        are welcome. The meeting takes place from 7:30pm online at BBB server
        of the FSFE. Bring a good mood.

		In addition to catching up on high school graduation, senior studies
		and adult education courses, there are numerous offers for adults to
		further their education. But what role does Free Software play in
		this? After we touched on adult education at the last meeting, this
		time we want to take a closer look at how Free Software can be
		accommodated there.
