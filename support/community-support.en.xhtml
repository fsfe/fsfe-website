    <h1>Community support</h1>

     <div id="introduction">

<p>
      Using and configuring software, particcularly for the first time, can be a complex task. Often instructions or assistance are required in order to know how to achieve what you need to with your computer. Sharing skills and knowledge is central to the Free Software philosophy, and as a result the Free Software support community offers a plethora of resources for meeting the needs of users and developers.

<h2>User manuals and help guides</h2>

<p>Most Free Software applications have manuals on how to use them. Manuals are good for finding out how to use the core features of a particular program. When you expect to be able to perform a task, but can't figure out how, reading the manual is often the best first step. Many software projects take great care to produce accurate and extensive user manuals, and reading them is often the shortest route to a solution.</p>

<p>In desktop applications, like Mozilla Firefox, or OpenOffice, these can usually be found in the 'Help' menu. In text-only terminal applications, these can usually be accessed by typing 'man' (short for manual) followed by the application name, like 'man mv' for the information on the move command. Sometimes manuals are installed separately to the application itself, particularly if the manual is very long. In such cases you either need to install the manual separately on your computer, or alternatively view the manual online, where it is usually also available.</p>

<h2>Wikis</h2>

<p>Wikis are websites which allow lots of different people to change the content of their webpages. They provide a platform for groups to work collaboratively on guides and documentation, and update it with their own knowledge and experience. Wikipedia is an example of a wiki which is used for encyclopedic information; wikis about Free Software projects contain only information about the application that they relate to.</p>

<p>Wikis are similar to manuals, but are often more detailed and more up-to-date. Some wikis have many contibutors are are excellent compendiums of guides and detailed instructions. Others however are not very well maintained, and may contain information which is out-of-date, or inexhaustive. If you need assistance with a Free Software application that has a wiki checking to see if your problem is documented there may well be worthwhile.</p>

<p>Wikis are accessed via a web browser, and appear like any ordinary website. You often need an account in order to add or edit wiki pages. You can also often question and discuss page content using the wiki software itself, and see past revisions of wiki pages.</p>

<h2>Web forums</h2>

<p>Forums are a medium of non-real time communication between a large number of different people. With a forum account, visitors can read messages published (or 'posted') by other visitors, and post messages of their own which will be visible to other forum users. They are good for a wide variety of types of question and support, especially questions which are very specific, or may not affect the majority of the application's users. They can be searched for messages relating to the problem that you have, and in cases where this doesn't return a solution, they can be used to post new questions.</p>

<p>Forums are very widely used by Free Software support communities, and can provide an easily acccessible database of structured information about other users' experiences, problems and solutions. Forums are accessible via a web browser, and often contain many thousands of messages.</p>
