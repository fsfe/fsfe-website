wins EU Datathon +++ YH4F winners and new round +++ No to chat 
control</h1>

<p>
  FSFE’s ‘TEDective’, a program helping to analyse public spending, 
  wins first prize in the EU Datathon and our very own Youth Hacking 
  4 Freedom contest starts again. An EU draft law might end secure 
  chats. Citizens in Sweden have a say with the Free Software Decidim 
  and the FSFE Switzerland asks administrations to join federated 
  social media.

<p>
  The FSFE’s proposal ‘TEDective’ <a href="/news/2022/news-20221026-01.html">won the first 
  prize in ‘transparency in public procurement’ challenge in the EU 
  Datathon</a> – the European open data competition. TEDective works 
  with public EU tendering data. The prototype program helps us analyse 
  how public administrations in the European Union spend their money. 
  For example, it allows journalists to find out how much money the 
  government spends on Microsoft licenses and products, but also it 
  helps to compare that spending with other regions in similar cases or 
  even in relation to other countries. Are you a data expert who wants 
  to help? Email <email>tedective@fsfe.org</email>.

  After a year of coding and evaluation, the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom 
  competition came to an end, giving us amazing projects. Over a 
  hundred people coming from 25 countries registered for the 
  competition, making it a truly pan-European event. <a href="/news/2022/news-20221004-01.html">The six 
  winning programs offer sign language transcription, a smart table 
  robot, a personal assistant, a music tutorial, file sharing, and a 
  homework manager. All Free Software</a>.

<p>
  The registration for the <a href="/news/2022/news-20221104-01.html">second 
  edition of “Youth Hacking 4 Freedom”</a>, the FSFE’s hacking 
  competition for teenagers from all over Europe, just started. This 
  contest offers young people aged between 14 and 18 the opportunity to 
  challenge themselves, meet like-minded people, and win cash prizes. <a href="/activities/yh4f/index.html">Register until 31 
  December 2022</a> and share the opportunity with schools and young 
  hackers!

<h3 id="eu-draft-law-might-end-secure-chats">EU draft law might end secure chats</h3>

<p>
  The European Commission proposed a directive on mandatory chat 
  control with the supposed aim to effectively tackle child sexual 
  abuse. If the law is enforced, Internet service providers will have 
  to monitor and scan all communications of citizens – including the 
  securely encrypted end-to-end ones. It is a threat to all our private 
  communication. On top of that, it is only big market players who can 
  carry out this enforced necessity to scan every single message. <a href="/news/2022/news-20221026-02.html">It would 
  hinder Free Software developers from writing and running their own versions of 
  communication software, and may deprive us of open standard 
  programming interfaces</a>.

<h3 id="podcast-citizens-participate-in-local-administrations">Podcast: Citizens participate in local administrations</h3>

<p>
  Now it is easier than ever for a municipality to ask its citizens 
  what building projects to prioritise, how to distribute a given 
  budget, or other questions. In our latest Software Freedom Podcast, 
  <a href="/news/podcast/episode-17.html">Petter 
  Joelson, director of the Swedish NGO Digidem Lab, explains the power 
  of the participation platform “Decidim” based on its implementation 
  in Sweden</a>. With <a href="https://decidim.org/">Decidim</a>, 
  municipalities can design citizen processes in a modular way to fit 
  their needs.

<p>
  Swedish administrations use participatory budgets – budgets in which 
  citizens participate. Citizens submit proposals and the 
  administration examines whether the proposal is legal and feasible. 
  Then, citizens vote on the approved proposals. With Decidim the process and the 
  time taken to implement the project can be monitored by everyone and 
  it is possible to check if something is not going according to plan. 
  The software is designed and suitable for large-scale implementations. 
  Many cities already use Decidim, for example New York, Barcelona, and 
  Helsinki.

<p>
  When public institutions share a message on social media they should 
  not limit it to proprietary platforms. To effectively communicate 
  with all citizens, including those who are rightfully concerned about 
  their privacy, administrations should also use federated social 
  media. The FSFE Switzerland and the GNU/Linux.ch explain this to 
  local authorities. The <a href="https://fedigov.ch/en/">Fedigov 
  website</a> (also available in <a href="https://fedigov.ch/">DE</a>, 
  <a href="https://fedigov.ch/fr/">FR</a>, <a href="https://fedigov.ch/it/">IT</a>) shows that ethical 
  communication benefits the public sector. You can use the letter 
  template and send a letter to your local authorities asking them to 
  join Mastodon, Pixelfeld, and Peertube.
