    <h1>On Software Freedom Day, support FSFE!</h1>

    <p newsteaser="yes">We need computers we can trust. The recent
    news about planet-wide surveillance make clear how important
    computer systems are for our society. Control of these computer
    systems needs to be in the hands of their users.
    </p>
    <p>
    Free Software is crucial to achieving this.  We need strong,
    independent organisations to fight for software freedom and civil
    rights in the digital age. At FSFE, we have more than a decade's
    experience in defending your rights and helping to create a better
    future.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now is the time to step up our efforts. We need your help. On this
    year's Software Freedom Day, please support our work and <a
    href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">sign up
    as a Fellow of FSFE</a>.
