<p>After six months of programming, Youth Hacking 4 Freedom (YH4F) participants are submitting their projects at the end of June, which 
will be evaluated by our experts. <a href="/activities/yh4f/jury">Our jury</a> is composed by 16 professionals with a different focus on Free Software. With their help, we cover 
a wide range of technical aspects and ensure that an expert is always available to evaluate a participant's project. One of our experts is 
Alexios Zavras, who has been involved with Free Software since 1983 and is an advocate for software freedom.</p>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Thank you very much Alexios for taking the time and talking with us. What inspired you to become a
jury member for this competition?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Alexios</strong>: I was inspired to become a jury member for YH4F because I believe in empowering young people to explore their creativity 
and technical skills. The opportunity to support and encourage the next generation of programmers, while promoting the values of Free Software, aligns 
with my passion for technology and education.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What do you enjoy most about being involved in this
kind of event?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Alexios</strong>: I enjoy witnessing the innovative ideas and solutions that young participants bring to the table. It is incredibly 
rewarding to see their enthusiasm and dedication, and to be part of a community that fosters growth and learning. The projects submitted address 
actual problems that often surprise me. </p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: If you had to choose only one, what would be your favorite thing about this competition? </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Alexios</strong>: My favorite thing about the competition is the sense of community and collaboration it fosters among participants. 
It is inspiring to see young programmers working together, sharing knowledge, and supporting each other in their projects. I am not only talking 
about teams working together and submitting a project, but also the interaction when these young creators meet each other for the first time in the award ceremony.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What skills do you think are most important for participants to take part in this competition? </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Alexios:</strong> Key skills include problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration. Technical proficiency is important, but the ability to think critically 
and work effectively with others is crucial for developing impactful projects. In the case of team work, coordination and project management skills are also crucial.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Have you seen any common mistakes or challenges among
the participants?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Alexios</strong>: A common challenge is underestimating the importance of documentation and user experience. Participants sometimes focus heavily 
on technical aspects but overlook how their software will be used and understood by others.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What impresses you the most in a project?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Alexios</strong>: I am most impressed by projects that demonstrate a clear understanding of user needs and provide innovative solutions
 to real-world problems. When participants show empathy and insight into their target audience, it elevates their work significantly. The best projects 
 are the ones where the creators are also users, since they build something "to scratch their own itch."</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Why do you think this programming competitions is
important for teenagers?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Alexios</strong>: This competition is important because it provides teenagers with a platform to express their ideas and develop skills that 
are crucial for their future careers. It encourages them to think critically, maybe work collaboratively, and understand the importance of sharing 
knowledge through Free Software</p>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What advice would you give to young programmers who
want to improve their skills?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Alexios</strong>: I would advise young programmers to continuously challenge themselves with new projects, seek feedback from peers and mentors, 
and stay curious about emerging technologies. Engaging with the community and contributing to Free Software projects can also provide valuable learning experiences.</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: In these last editions, you have been checking several YH4F projects. 
If you would have to give advice to the current participants, what would it be? </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Alexios</strong>: My advice to current participants would be to focus on understanding the needs of their users and to prioritize 
clear communication and documentation. Additionally, do not be afraid to iterate and refine your ideas, embrace feedback as a tool for growth 
and improvement. It is rarely the case when a first idea is so well-formed that it has to remain unchanged during the development process.</p>
