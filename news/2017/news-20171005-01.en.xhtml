  <h1>EU Copyright Review: Tell Legislators to Save Code Share</h1>
  
  <p>The FSFE, together with Open Forum Europe, asks the 
  EU policymakers to Save Code Share in the current on-going EU Copyright review. 
  Today we ask you to support our newest campaign <a href="https://savecodeshare.eu/">Save Code Share</a>
  by signing an <a href="https://savecodeshare.eu/#sign-letter">Open Letter</a> 
  addressed to the EU policymakers.In this letter we request EU legislators 
  to preserve the ability to collaboratively build software online in current 
  EU Copyright Directive proposal.</p>
  
  <p>If the proposed changes targeted at online platforms are implemented, this would 
  force online code sharing repositories to use filters that monitor and 
  preemptively take down any content that could potentially infringe copyright, 
  including entire code repositories. Otherwise, platforms will be held 
  directly liable for any alleged copyright infringement found in the source code 
  hosted on their services. Such shift in the liability regime from 
  rightholders to platforms would durably harm the Free Software ecosystem 
  which often relies on code hosting platforms to build software together, 
  as it will result in more arbitrary code removal on code hosting 
  platforms.</p>
  
  <h2>How does Article 13 harm Free Software?</h2>
  
  <p>A lot of the software used in everyday life contains Free Software 
  components. Free Software is popular because it can be shared under 
  terms that allow and encourage using it for any purpose, studying its 
  source code, sharing it with others, and customising it according to 
  one's needs. Source code is often shared through online code hosting 
  platforms that act as a main access point for collaboration online.</p>
  
  <p>The current legislative negotiations over the EU "Copyright Reform" 
  package, and particularly Article 13, <a href="/news/2017/news-20170908-01.html">indicate</a>
  that we risk seeing the imposition of far-reaching rules for every online 
  platform which allows their users to upload large amounts of content, 
  including code hosting platforms. Specifically, the proposals embodied 
  in the draft of Article 13 threaten code hosting platforms by imposing 
  new obligations on them. Namely, code hosting platforms will be legally 
  required to use costly (but ultimately fundamentally flawed) filtering 
  technologies. There are no known filtering technologies that could accurately 
  and reliably identify whether any Free Software is being shared in 
  accordance with its legal terms and conditions. In addition, the proposed 
  Article 13 will oblige online platforms to monitor their users and 
  actively seek for possible copyright infringements.</p>

			</div>
  
  <p>Consequently, Article 13, as currently proposed, would shift the 
  responsibility for protecting allegedly infringed rights from rightholders 
  to platforms in a way that disproportionately harms the sector that is
  a cornerstone of innovation.</p>
  
  <p>Article 13 would restrict the freedom of developers to choose freely 
  among a variety of software components and tools, as these tools and 
  components will no longer be available online. In a domino effect, Free 
  Software projects could no longer rely upon precedent projects and tools 
  due to an arbitrary upload filter that can prevent code being hosted online. 
  As a consequence, software will become less reliable, and digital infrastructure 
  less resilient for everybody.</p>
  
  <h2>Take Action Now</h2>
  
  <p>Please <a href="https://savecodeshare.eu/">sign and share the Open Letter</a> 
  both on behalf of an organisation, and as an individual. The Open Letter 
  together with your signatures will be handed over to the Members of the 
  European Parliament and the EU Council. For more information on how 
  proposed Article 13 would harm fundamental rights and negatively impact 
  collaborative software development and Free Software, please <a href="https://savecodeshare.eu/static/assets/WhitePaper-ImpactofArticel13onSoftwareEcosystem-SaveCodeShare.pdf">read our White Paper</a>.
