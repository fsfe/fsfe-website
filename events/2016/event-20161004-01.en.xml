		<body> 
			<p>FSFE will be present with a booth in LinuxCon+ContainerCon 
			Europe 2016 in Berlin, a big event where developers, sys admins, 
			architects and all levels of technical talent gather together 
      under one roof in order to further develop the GNU/Linux platform. 
			If you want to meet with us, then pass by our booth, where you 
			will have the opportunity to engage in interesting discussions, 
			to grab a bunch of stickers and flyers, and why not, to get a 
			new T-shirt or a bag from FSFE's merchandise?!</p>
