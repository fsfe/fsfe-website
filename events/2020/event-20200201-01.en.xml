      <p>FOSDEM, Europe's largest Free Software conference, takes place on
      February 1 and 2 at Campus Solbosch of Free University Brussels (ULB).
      The FSFE will be present with multiple talks: Matthias Kirschner, President of the FSFE, gives a talk about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/software_freedom/">"The core values of software freedom"</a> and a lightning talk about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/free_software_hackers_needed/">"Civil society needs Free Software hackers"</a>.

<p>As usual, FSFE is also present with a booth and presents latest news from our
      work, a wide range of information material, stickers, and postcards, and
      of course the latest <a href="/order/order.html">FSFE fashion</a>. This
      time, FSFE's booth is in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=50.8147&amp;mlon=4.3819#map=16/50.8147/4.3819">the second level of building K</a>, upstairs from
