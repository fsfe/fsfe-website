      <p>Lucas Lasota and Jitendra Palepu, FSFE's legal project managers will present the outcome of a study related to interoperability obligations of the Digital Market Act (DMA) from the perspective of Free Software. </p>
     <p>The paper provides a perspective that combines an analysis of the compliance approaches from gatekeepers in relation to Art. 6(7) DMA with a report over the experiences from free and open source software projects (FOSS) in requesting interoperability. The study  concentrates on Apple as gatekeeper and portray diverse challenges involved in granting interoperability. The article concludes with lessons learned from regulatory activity over interconnection of terminal equipment (routers and modems) as examples of liberalization processes involving interoperability and end-user devices for internet connection.</p>
     <p>The Symposium "DMA enforcement: Trends and gaps in the first year of application" has been organised by Art. 19 together with several universities. </p>
