    <title>FSFE for Freedom Not Fear</title>
    <body>
		The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) supports Free Software so that every citizen can play an independent, active and responsible part in our  information society. However, censorship of content, violations of the principle of 'Net Neutrality' and increasing online surveillance do not  fit with these goals. FSFE is therefore appealing for participation in the world-wide day of action "Freedom Not Fear", which takes place  this Saturday, the 11th October.
