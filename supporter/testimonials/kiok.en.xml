	  For me, Free Software is rather a philosophy than just the way of
	  sharing code. After reading first-time about the Four Freedoms, i knew
	  immediately that these conditions are the transfer of the
	  participative democratic idea into the digital world. When it comes to
	  terms of security, reliability and data-safety, one must admit that in
	  proprietary software, some inevitable risks do exist and Free
	  Software, with almost no effort and tremendous positive side effects,
	  manages to make them disappear. Being a fellow of the FSFE is my way
	  to thank the Free Software Community and to support the representation
	  of Free Software interests.
