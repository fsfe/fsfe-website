<h1>How (not) to set up a public warning system</h1>

<p>
  What is the best way to alert people about catastrophes? Germany went
  with proprietary apps which caused the recent warning day ("Warntag")
  to become an official failure. We analysed the situation and found
  more robust solutions that respect user rights.
</p>

<p>
  The basic idea of testing emergency systems is to find potential or
  real problems. However, it is remarkable how much went wrong in
  Germany's official warning day in September. Especially the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-nationwide-emergency-warning-day-sees-bumpy-rollout/a-54877137">unreliability</a>
  of the officially advertised non-free and non-standard apps forced
  the Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI), that is in charge of the
  responsible Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster
  Assistance (BBK), to label the test day as a failure.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE analysed the findings together with experts in civil
  protection and mobile networking to figure out why the apps failed,
  and what a more resilient and open system can look like.

<h2>Digital Warning Systems in Germany</h2>

<p>
  There are three popular publicly financed apps that can carry
  official emergency alerts to their users: Katwarn, Nina, and Biwapp.
  All three are proprietary, so non-free
  software that does not allow their users to use, study, share, and
  improve the software. Moreover, they rely on fetching emergency alerts
  from the central <em>MoWaS</em> ("modular warning system"), and forwarding
  these to the app users using their phones' WiFi or mobile internet
  connection.
</p>

<p>
  An overload of this central system was the main reason why many
  alerts did not reach the app users in time or at all. This did not
  come as a surprise, though. In a scenario where millions of devices
  are reached at the same time from a central instance with
  one-to-one (<em>unicast</em>) connections, network bottlenecks are
  almost inevitable.
</p>

<p>
  The underlying problem, however, is unnecessary complexity and duplicated
  structures. Instead of investing large amounts of public money into
  centralised systems and three proprietary apps, other states run a
  more resilient and well-tested infrastructure for distributing
  emergency messages: SMSCB, more commonly called <em>cell
  broadcasts</em>, to provide one-to-many messages.
</p>

<h2>Cell Broadcasts</h2>

<p>
  Standardised around 1990, cell broadcasts are an established method to
  send messages to all mobile network users, either in a whole country
  or limited to specific areas, in no more than a few seconds. Phones do
  not have to be registered in a specific network to receive these
  messages, and alerts with the highest priority will ring an
  alarm even if the phone is muted. And unlike SMS and mobile internet, cell
  broadcasts have a reserved channel that works even if phone cells are
  overloaded with users and messages.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, cell broadcasts can be received by every phone, no
  matter whether emergency apps, an up-to-date operating system, or
  proprietary Google/Apple services are installed. Because the
  communication is one-to-many, there are no privacy concerns either.
  These clear benefits made the European Union decide to base the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU-Alert">EU-Alert</a> system on
  cell broadcasts. As a directive, this has to be implemented by all EU
  member states before June 2022, unless a state can provide a service
  with a similarily reliable performance â€“ which is a very high
  threshold.
</p>

<p>
  Regardless of these advantages, Germany chose to not base its
  emergency alert system on the SMSBC standard, unlike other countries
  such as the Netherlands, Greece, Romania, Italy, or the USA. Because
  there is no official obligation to do so, most mobile network
  providers deactivated this feature to save costs. Instead, much
  higher costs are incurred by the taxpayers to finance an isolated
  system and accompanying proprietary apps.

<h2>Warning Apps</h2>

<p>
  Despite the clear advantages of cell broadcasts, warning apps have
  their justification. Users can request various information about
  other regions and past events. However, basing a
  large part of the emergency communication system on warning apps has proven to be
  too prone to single points of failure.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, because of the critical role of emergency communication systems for the public, they have
  to be <a href="/freesoftware/">Free Software</a>, and built upon <a href="/freesoftware/standards/">Open Standards</a>. Only with the
  freedoms to use, study, share, and improve software, can they be
  analysed by citizens and independent security researchers. This in
  turn increases trust and willingness to install a complementary
  warning app, as the practical experience with the Corona tracing apps
  shows.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  Our analysis concludes with three key findings that not only the
  responsible administrations but also other actors should keep in
  mind.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The foundation of emergency communication from authorities
    should be a standardised, resilient system that
    is capable of sending millions of messages to as many devices as
    possible, regardless of their operating system or installed
    software. Currently, SMSBC, or cell broadcasts, seem to be the best
    possible implementation that works well in numerous states.
    Therefore, we appreciate that the EU chose to base EU-Alert on cell
    broadcasts.
  </li>

  <li>
    Warning apps can be a useful complement. Especially for publicly
    funded apps, it is crucial to develop and release the software under a
    Free Software license, following the principle of <a href="https://publiccode.eu">Public Money? Public Code!</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Testing warning systems is important, and the planned regular warning days
    should be maintained in the future. It is normal that errors occur
    during these tests, but they must not be glossed over. Instead
    errors must be addressed thoroughly.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In this sense, the responsible administrations, BBK and BMI, have a lot of work
  ahead. But it is doable, both from the practical and financial
  perspectives.
