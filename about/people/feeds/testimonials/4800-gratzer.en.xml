      As a web designer I spend most of my time working on computers.
      Therefore, usability is very relevant to me. Software vendors often
      ignore open standards. They deliberately build solutions that only work
      using their own products. I oppose this greed and take a stand for
      cooperation. Free software relies on open standards. This way it enables
      me to provide a diverse audience with clear and reliable experiences - no
      matter which software they run. I create media in formats that can be
      used freely by everyone. By employing free software I support
      independence and help making the world a better place.
