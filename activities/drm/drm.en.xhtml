      <b>Disney</b>: <q>If people know about DRM, we've already failed!</q><br />
      <b>FSFE</b>: <q>DRM.info ends the silence on DRM!</q>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="/documents/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> is software
        that puts the user in control of their own computers and devices. In
        contrast, Digital Restrictions Management is technology to put the
        user under control of a third party providing materials, such as
        audio, video or text. These two goals seem fundamentally incompatible
        to FSFE.

<h2>What is Digital Restrictions Management?</h2>
<p>Digital restrictions management (DRM), sometimes referred to as digital rights management, is a class of technologies intended to limit the use of digital media and devices after sale. In essence, DRM refers to technology which inhibits a particular use of digital media where that use is not desired or intended by the hardware manufacturer, publisher or copyright holder. Free Software is software that puts the user in control of their own computers and devices. In contrast, Digital Restrictions Management is technology to put the user under control of a third party: these two goals seem fundamentally incompatible to FSFE.
</p>

<h2>Who else objects to DRM?</h2>
<p>
It is not only FSFE that sees problems with DRM. The German society
      for computer sciences ("Gesellschaft für Informatik") states: <a
        href="http://www.gi-ev.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Download/GI-Position_Urheberrecht2006.pdf">"If
        DRM prevails in the market then users will lose control of their
        computers"</a>.  Symantec shares this opinion: <a
        href="http://www.symantec.com/enterprise/security_response/weblog/2006/08/assessment_of_vista_kernel_mod.html">
        "As a result, customers around the world will lose their ability to
        choose what security solutions they would like to run on their
        operating systems, and be forced to use only those solutions offered or
        allowed by Microsoft".</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      This loss of control means that publishing houses, TV stations, the
      government (including its administrations), banks, producing companies
      and individuals will not only lose control over their graphics cards,
      computer screens and hard drives; but also over their mobile phones,
      digital cameras and any other digital device they theoretically own.
    </p>

<h2>How will change be effected?</h2>
    <p>
      Although FSFE is convinced that there is no legitimate case in which
      a society built upon freedom and democracy would consider it legitimate
      to put the personal use of one's own computers and devices under control
      of a third party, we cannot but recognise that extensive global legal
      provisions have been put in place to allow and enforce just that.
    </p>

    <p>
      We therefore consider it necessary to revisit international treaties and
      national laws such as TRIPS, DMCA, EUCD and others, and will seek to do
      so in the relevant forums, even though it is a difficult task and not
      likely to succeed quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Knowing the timescales involved and assuming that DRM technologies will
      not simply disappear over night, we propose the following concrete short- to
      medium-term legislative goals:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>DRM warning signs on devices and products</dt>
      
      <dd>Customers should be given a fair chance to not accidentally buy
      products that will subjugate them to control by a third party. In order
      to be able to make an informed decision, they should be provided with the
      information at the time of sales.</dd>

      <dt>Allow circumvention for lawful purposes</dt>

      <dd>Lawful use of one's computer and devices should never become illegal.
      Yet this is what the "anti circumvention" provisions of some laws do:
      Operations allowed by law become illegal not for the operation itself,
      but for the circumvention that was necessary to exercise one's
      right.</dd>

      <dt>No DRM in the political arena</dt>

      <dd>Governments need to be in full and sovereign control of their own
      data, procedures and decisions. A user of DRM software, including
      governments, can never have full control over their own computer. For
      this reason, DRM systems have no place in the political area.</dd>

      <dt>Public services for the public</dt>
      
      <dd>Public services should be available to all citizens, including those
      who make use of <a href="/documents/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>.
      It should therefore be mandatory to always provide a way to access public
      services and information with Free Software.</dd>

      information platform with contributing organisations from various fields,
      including Digital Rights, Libraries, Creative Communities and Customer
      Protection.
