		  <p>
                  For beginners it is easiest to start with liberating
                  mobile apps. We introduce to you dedicated Free
                  Software app stores and present some apps for the most
                  common use cases, for example messaging, navigation,
                  or games.

          <h3><a href="#OS">Free Software Operating Systems</a></h3>
		  <p>
		  Most operating systems on phones you can buy are not free. They contain
      pre-installed proprietary software which limit your freedoms and harm your
      privacy. Advanced users should therefore install a mobile operating system
      that is as free as possible.

      <h2 id="Apps">The Apps</h2>
      
      <p>
        For most people, the <a href="https://play.google.com/">Google
        Play Store</a> is the only or the main source for their
        applications. It doesn't even tell you whether an app is Free Software
        or not, let alone its license. Unfortunately, most apps from this or
        other markets are proprietary. Even if you install a Free Software app,
        there is no reason to trust the downloaded binary. Using Google
        Play also requires a Google account, and is itself proprietary software.
        It is recommended to not use this market at all.
      </p>

      <h3 id="F-Droid">F-Droid</h3>

      </div>

      <p>
        The <a href="http://f-droid.org/">F-Droid initiative</a> was started to
        change the sad Free Software app situation in the Android world. It
        builds a repository of easily-installable Free Software apps for the Android
        platform. There is an Android client application that makes it easy to
        browse Free Software applications, install them onto your device, and
        keep track of updates. Apps available on F-Droid do not contain hidden 
        costs, are safe for children, and are transparent about possible 
        <a href="https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/AntiFeatures">antifeatures</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The F-Droid repository contains details of multiple versions of each
        application. You can also easily create and add own repositories. But
        since the initiative is <a
        href="https://gitlab.com/fdroid/">very active</a>,
        developing in a decentralised fashion and open to collaboration,
        creating own repositories is not really necessary. Its goal is to
        include all useful Free Software Android applications and to keep up
        with their updates.

    <h3 id="selection">Selected apps for common use cases</h3>
    
    <p>
      Nowadways, we fortunately live in a world in which we can choose from
      various Free Software apps for almost any use case. This sections aims
      to present a small selection of apps which are fitting for
      starters. By no means can such a list be ever perfect for every individual
      case. We also recommend you to look at the complete <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/">F-Droid repository</a> or app
      recommendations by <a href="https://prism-break.org/">PRISM Break</a>, <a
      href="https://myshadow.org/">Me and My Shadow</a>, or <a
      href="https://securityinabox.org/">Security in a Box</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="browser">Web browsing</h4>
    
    <p>
      In F-Droid you can find many web browsers for different
      audiences. Probably the most well known is Mozilla's <a
      href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/mobile/">Firefox Mobile</a> which is
      available via <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/de.marmaro.krt.ffupdater/">FFUpdater</a> or
      its GNU rebranding <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gnu.icecat/">IceCatMobile</a>. Users who
      prefer lightweight and privacy-aware apps may also want to try <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.klar/">Firefox Klar</a> (also
      known as Firefox Focus).
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="email">Email</h4>
    
    <p>
      <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fsck.k9/">K-9 Mail</a> 
      enables its users to add multiple email accounts and offers a 
      wide range of options. It also supports integration with 
      encryption apps like <a 
      href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.keychain/">OpenKeychain</a> 
      and is able to read GnuPG encrypted messages.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="im">Instant Messaging</h4>
    
    <p>
      The situation of Free Software apps for instant messaging is
      complicated. While there are 100% Free Software solutions like <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.siacs.conversations/">Conversations</a> and Zom
      (for XMPP/Jabber, iOS users can use <a href="https://chatsecure.org/">ChatSecure</a>), <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.b44t.messenger/">Delta Chat</a> (using
      email) or <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.alpha/">Riot.im</a>
      (using Matrix), they probably will not be very widespread among your friends
      because their user bases are relatively small. Other apps are completely or
      mostly Free Software but have other antifeatures like dependencies on non-free
      servers and libraries, or no server federation, for example <a
      href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> or <a
      href="https://wire.com/">Wire</a>. There are several initiatives to make instant
      messaging as free, secure, decentralised, and user-friendly as possible, and we
      hope to be able to make clearer recommendations in the future.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="multimedia">Multimedia</h4>
    
    <p>
      Plenty of Free Software apps aim to make you enjoy audio and video
      on your mobile phone. Notable apps are <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/">NewPipe</a>
      as a lightweight interface for YouTube which adds some unique
      features, the <a
      href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html">VLC
      Player</a> for videos, or <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.programmierecke.radiodroid2/">RadioDroid</a>
      to listen to thousands of radio stations
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="outdoors">Outdoors</h4>
    
    <p>
      When you are travelling, your mobile phone can be a helper for
      you. <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/de.grobox.liberario/">Transportr</a>
      knows public transportation networks of countries and cities all
      over the world. <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/">OsmAnd</a>
      serves detailed offline and online maps of whereever you are
      right now, and also includes navigation when riding your bicycle
      or car.
    </p>
    
    <h4 id="games">Games</h4>
    
    <p>
      F-Droid contains various mobile games for almost any taste. For
      example puzzlers may enjoy <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.uberspot.a2048/">2048</a>
      while block sandbox fans can play <a
      href="https://f-droid.org/packages/net.minetest.minetest/">Minetest</a>
      in single as well as multiplayer mode. For fans of 1010! there is 
      <a 
      href="https://www.f-droid.org/packages/io.github.lonamiwebs.klooni/">1010! 
      Klooni</a>.
    </p>
    

<h2 id="OS">The Operating Systems</h2>
      
      <p> 
        An operating system is a collection of software that enables you to use
        your phone and run other applications on it. Even though Android is <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html">mostly
        free</a>, many phones ship with proprietary components and add-ons. Some
        phones also have a locked <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting">boot loader</a>
        which prevents you from booting and installing other operating systems.
        If you want to buy an Android phone, make sure that the boot loader can
        be <a
        href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">unlocked</a>.</p>

      <p>On some devices it can only be unlocked with clever hacks
        and their manufacturers tend to declare your warranty void when you unlock their device's boot loader.
        But, given European  Directive 1999/44/CE, just the fact that you modified or changed the software of your device,
        is not a sufficient reason to void your statutory warranty.
        <a href="/freesoftware/legal/flashingdevices.html" title="Does rooting your phone invalidate its warranty?">See Carlo Piana's and Matija Šuklje's analysis</a> for more information.
        There are
        also companies that ship their devices with an unlocked bootloader or
        provide you with the means to unlock it. Besides that, it is a good idea
        to check if there are free versions of Android <a
        href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">supporting the device</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="Replicant">Replicant</h3>

       <div class="image left">
        <img alt="Replicant" src="/activities/android/replicant.png" />
      </div>

      <p>
        <a href="http://replicant.us/">Replicant</a> is a
        distribution of Android that is 100% Free Software. Since it does not
        use any non-free drivers, it currently works on a limited number of
        devices.
      </p>

      <p>
        We ask you to help Replicant extend its support to more devices. You can <a
          href="http://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/issues">contribute
        code</a>, and <a
      href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/donate-to-replicant-and-support-free-software-on-mobile-devices">donate
    devices</a> to the Replicant team for testing purposes.
      </p>

	  <p>
	  	Phones with pre-installed Replicant are available from <a href="https://tehnoetic.com/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=59">Tehnoetic</a>
		that donates part of the profits back to the Replicant initiative.

      <h3 id="LineagoeOS">LineageOS</h3>
      
      <div class="image right">
        <img alt="LineageOS" src="/activities/android/lineageos.png" />
      </div>

      <p>
        <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a> is a version of
        Android which you can use without a Google account. Even though it is
        usually more free than the software your device comes with, freedom
        is not its main objective. While LineageOS works on <a
        href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">most Android
        devices</a>, it makes use of <a
        href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">non-free
        device drivers and firmware</a> which are fetched
        from a device and included in the ROM. LineageOS is the most popular fork of the discontinued CyanogenMod project.
	  </p> 

    <p>
      LineageOS does not contain Google Play services by default which
      is good for your freedom. However, if you really need some of
      these proprietary apps or libraries you can try the Free Software
      implementation <a href="https://microg.org/">microG</a>.
    </p>

      <p>
	    We collected <a
        href="/activities/android/help.html#OS">information</a>
        about how you can help to ensure that LineageOS and other operating systems become as good as possible, and
        how to identify and remove non-free parts.
