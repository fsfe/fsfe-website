    <title>AVM GPL violation</title>
    <description>
      Can a company modify GPL-licensed software on a third-party device? Router 
      manufacturer AVM accused Cybits of copyright and trademark infringement 
      for modifying the original router firmware, which is largely based on the 
      Linux kernel. Together with gpl-violations.org, we successfully convinced 
      the court that the terms of the GPL licence are binding: software under 
      this licence can be freely modified and installed, even if it is supplied 
      as part of the firmware of an embedded device.
