  <h2 class="painted">Why "upcycling"?</h2>

  <p>You have an Android phone and its manufacturer does not offer you recent updates of your phone or operating system? You are faced with the dilemma of either buying a new phone or keep running and outdated system? <strong>Learn on this page how you can install and use a Free Software operating system on your phone that keeps you up to date and puts you back in control of your device.</strong></p>

  <h3>How does it work?</h3>

  <p><strong>To get back full control of your device and to extend its usage lifetime, you can install a so-called "Custom ROM".</strong> Custom ROMs are Android alternatives based on the original operating system. Every time a new Android version is published there are multiple companies and communities who take the release code and re-publish it in a modified version. This is possible because large parts of the Android operating system - excluding third party apps, the G-Suite and some core libraries - are already Free Software. In practice, these alternative versions usually ship a full Android-experience but without the Google dependencies and Google's proprietary software. And without other proprietary third-party apps that you might be used to see pre-installed when buying a new phone like. Meaning they actually come more lightweight and slim.</p>
  
  <p>Having removed a lot of dependencies and other third-party apps comes with another benefit, that these Custom ROMs are sometimes easier to install on phones with less hardware capacities. But probably the biggest benefit is that these Custom ROMs often get packaged for phones whose initial manufacturers do not support with any successive Android version anymore. If your manufacturer sold your phone with Android version X and does not offer you its follow up release, the Android version x+1, it is very likely a modified Custom ROM of Android version x+1 can be installed on your phone.

  <h2 class="painted">Unlocking the bootloader</h2>

  <p><strong>To be able to install a Custom ROM, you initially need to unlock the bootloader of your device.</strong> The bootloader is an underlying software level on top of which you install the operating system. As a security measure, when you buy a new phone the booloader is locked by default. This security measure however also prevents you from taking control of your device by installing an alternative operating system. Even if this alternative is a more up-to-date version of your Android and thus actually offers higher security in your daily use.</p>

  <p>Some phones are easy to unlock the bootloader, others are not. It totally depends on your supplier and manufacturer of the phone. Please note that we cannot offer you online or remote help with this process. You are welcome to participate in one of <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/workshops.html">our workshops</a>. Apart from that you usually find help when you look for "unlock bootloader" at your manufacturer's homepage. Apart from that there are many forums, platforms, magazines and other websites available who offer guides on how to unlock your bootloader in different qualities. Again, we cannot offer support with this. But maybe you find help if you visit your local repair café or hackerspace.</p>

  <h3>Controversies around unlocking bootloader</h3>

  <p>Be aware that manufacturers often like to scare you away from unlocking your bootloader. Not only that they make you a hard time doing so but they also claim that you void your warranty. <a href="/activities/android/flashingdevices.html">Following the analysis of the FSFE's legal experts</a> this is however not true: <em>"Unless the seller can prove that modifying the software, rooting your device or flashing it with some other OS or firmware was the cause for the defect,"</em> you are covered by the  “compulsory warranty” as it is described in the European Directive 1999/44/CE. But keep in mind, that during the process of unlocking your bootloader you can brick your phone. This should however not happen if you are careful and follow the recommendations.</p>

  <h3>Advantages of unlocking the bootloader</h3>

    <li>You can root your smartphone.</li>
  </ul>


    <h2 class="painted">Using and choosing your phone model</h2>

  <p>Some phones are easier to upcycle then others. This is because some manufacturers make it hard for you to upcycle your phone so that you buy a new one instead of renewing the old one. Some even want to prevent you from unlocking your bootloader by using heavy <a href="httops://drm.info">digital restriction management</a> and potential downgrades of your hardware once you unlock the bootloader. If you already have a phone, find help and consequences on unlocking your bootloader on the manufacturer's pages or in specific communities in the Internet.</p>

  <p><strong>If you are currently in need to buy a new phone it is recommendable to choose your phone also based on its easiness to unlock its booloader.</strong> Not only do you make yourself a more easy time but also do you support more open phones with your choice. As a general note meanwhile there are several phones that come with a Custom ROM pre-installed. This is of course the easiest option since they took away all the burden already and offer you an easy-to-use experience. <!--Apart from that the Google phones are easy to unlock. Although it sounds contradictory first, that the Google phones are the ones where it is easiest to install an alternative openrating system without any Google dependencies and software. This is because Google's business is not selling phones but developing the software. They like developers to play around with the hardware and their business model does not depend on them buying a new phone every year or two.--> Find more information on different models and on choosing your phone in <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org">our dedicated wiki page</a></p>

  <h2 class="painted">Flashing a Custom ROM</h2>

  <p>"Flashing" is the process of installing a new operating system on your phone. This can be a successor of your current operating system or an alternative version, a Custom ROM. You usually can only install a Custom ROM if you have successfully unlocked your bootloader (see above). </p>

  <h3>Choosing a custom ROM</h3>

  <p>If you want to install an alternative operating system on your phone, there are many many ROMs to choose from. Some of them are closer to the original Android, others are more separated. Some include more Free Software components or pre-installed apps than others. Some have the focus on security, others on usability, others on modularity. The amount of custom ROMs to choose from can be compelling in the beginning. But in the end the choice gets limited by the phone model you have and the type of system you like to have, so it boils down to a overseeable number. We collected some of the more prominent ones on our <a href="/activities/android/android.html">free your android pages</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="painted">Discovering the world of free software</h2>

  <p><strong>Free Software is what runs most part of our digital infrastructure, and our devices.</strong> The Internet heavily relies on the innovations and accessibility of Free Software. And during the last years it is also of ever growing importance and availability for your smartphone.</p>

  <p><a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">Free Software is sustainable software</a>. Not only will the software be available for everyone everytime, it is also helpful from an ecological point of view. It helps to extend usage lifetime of electronic devices. And Free Software is also <a href="/activities/android/android.html">good for your privacy</a>. It helps you to keep control over your data. And, as you can see on this page, it also helps you to reduce ewaste and to upcycle your phone.</p>

  <p>After upcycling your phone and installing a Free Software operating system on it you have the choice to manually post-install the Google software and libraries and be exposed to their data collection once again. Or to keep control over your software and data and use your phone with as many Free Software apps as possible. For many users this is the introduction into a world full of Free Software. </p>

<div class="color-box background rounded" data-color="android-lime">
  <p>Any app you can replace with a Free Software one is one important step towards a more eco-friendly and user-friendly digital environment.</p>
</div>

  <p><strong>Discovering the full world of Free Software on your mobile phone with an ease usually works with a Free Software app store called F-Droid and a replacement for the Google libraries called MicroG.</strong> If you have both installed you can additionall install the Aurora store to get all the proprietary apps you might be missing from the Google Play store. We do however recommend to look for Free Software alternatives in F-Droid.</p>

          <div>  <h2>F-Droid</h2><p>The F-Droid initiative has completely changed and facilitated the Free Software app availability in the Android world by offering a repository of easily-installable Free Software apps for the Android platform. In practice this means that you can use F-Droid in a similar experience as you might be used to use the Google Play store. There is an Android client application that makes it easy to browse Free Software applications, install or uninstall them onto your device, and keep track of updates. <a href="/activities/android/liberate.html#F-Droid">Read more about F-Droid and some recommended apps</a> on our Free Your Android Pages.</p></div>

          <div> <h2>MicroG</h2>

  <p>MicroG is a "Free Software re-implementation of Google’s proprietary Android user space apps and libraries". In practice that means MicroG allows other Free Software apps to seamlessly integrate into the Android system without having to use Google software for this. Although most microG components are far from complete, users are amazed by the results. Free software users got extended application support, privacy-caring users can reduce or monitor data that is sent to Google and especially older phones can expect some battery life improvements. <a href="/activities/android/liberate.html#F-Droid">Read more about MicroG</a> on our Free Your Android Pages.</p></div>
