<h1>REUSE makes software licensing as easy as one-two-three</h1>

<p>
REUSE Specification 3.3 and REUSE tool 5.0.0 are released today, making 
it even easier to license your code as Free Software. REUSE provides all 
the tools and documentation that developers need to apply 
standards-compliant and comprehensive licensing information to their 
projects, without needing to be a legal expert.

<p>
The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) started 
<a href="https://reuse.software">REUSE</a> in 2017 to make licensing easy, 
comprehensive, unambiguous, and machine-readable. This toolkit consists 
of a specification that standardises licensing, a tool that helps 
achieve and verify compliance with the specification, and documentation 
that helps developers through the process.
</p>

<p>
Today, the REUSE Project announced the release of <a href="https://reuse.software/spec-3.3">specification version 3.3</a> and <a href="https://reuse.readthedocs.io/en/v5.0.2/readme.html">
tool version 5.0.0</a>. These releases follow closely on the heels of 
the <a href="/news/2024/news-20240620-01.html">3.2 release this past 
summer</a>, which introduced the <a href="https://reuse.software/spec-3.3/#reusetoml">'REUSE.toml'</a>, a 
configuration file which allows easy and precise licensing annotations 
of other files in a project.
</p>

<p>
In this new 3.3 update, the specification builds on version 3.2 by 
incorporating <a href="https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-website/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#33---2024-11-14">additional 
refinements</a>, some of those small tweaks proposed by the community.
</p>

<p>
The new release of the tool comes with <a href="https://reuse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history.html#v5-0-0-2024-11-14">bug 
fixes, performance improvements, and the ability to lint individual 
files instead of the entire project</a>.
</p>

<h2>How does REUSE work?</h2>
<p>
The core idea behind REUSE is really simple. First, choose and provide 
your licences. Second, add copyright and licensing information to each 
file. And finally, confirm REUSE compliance using the tool. REUSE makes 
adding copyright and licensing information as simple as possible, using 
industry-standard <a href="https://spdx.dev/">System Package Data Exchange 
(SPDX)</a> tags that are easily parsed by many tools.
</p>

       <figcaption>Each file needs just two tags, one for copyright and one for licensing.</figcaption>
 </figure>     

<p>
By making licensing so comprehensive, the reuse of code becomes a lot 
simpler, hence the project’s name. If a third party finds some 
REUSE-compliant code that they like, they can easily find the copyright 
and licensing, and they can in practice just copy the file to their own 
project without losing any information. In the past, re-users of code 
would have often had to guess a file’s licensing from incomplete or 
ambiguous information. But with REUSE, this process becomes trivial, and 
the developer’s Free Software is much more easily propagated.
</p>

<h2>A community standard</h2>
<p>
REUSE is steadily being adopted by more and more projects. In 2020, <a href="https://kde.org">KDE</a> became one of the biggest Free Software 
communities to adopt REUSE as their licensing policy, after the Linux 
kernel in 2017. Other big adopters since then are <a href="https://weblate.org">Weblate</a>, the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> programming language, <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>, <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>, the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/">Khronos Group</a>, the German Aerospace 
Center, and many others. <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org">Software Heritage</a> has begun 
recommending REUSE as a way to prepare projects for archival.
</p>


<blockquote>
“An approach such as REUSE makes it much easier to follow an established 
good practice… I do not have to think where to put a specific 
information such as the license files as REUSE gives me clear advice. In 
addition, REUSE helps me to check whether I accidentally missed 
something. Such tools are really, really important because they bring a 
standard into practice.” <cite>Tobias Schlauch, German Aerospace 
Center</cite>
</blockquote>


<p>
Under the current system of copyright, software is non-free by default. 
As such, licensing is the backbone that enables software to be free. 
REUSE helps the Free Software community do this as clearly and as simply 
as possible.
</p>

<p>
Adopting REUSE is fortunately easier than ever. The <a href="https://reuse.software/tutorial/">tutorial</a> walks developers 
through the three steps, and the <a href="https://reuse.software/faq/">FAQ</a> answers all questions about 
copyright, about licensing, and about REUSE. If you need more 
motivations for adopting REUSE, <a href="https://reuse.software/faq/#why-care">this FAQ entry</a> goes into 
more depth.
