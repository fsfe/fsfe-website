  More than 100 civil society organisations across sectors have already 
  signed our open letter about “The universal right to install any 
  software on any device”. Now, in the European Week for Waste 
  Reduction, we open up the letter to be signed by individuals. Join 
  our cause and make your voice heard!

  The European Union is about to redefine its ecodesign criteria for 
  products within several legislative proposals in the upcoming months. 
  The European Commission has already published a proposal for the 
  “Sustainable Products Initiative” as well as the “Directive on 
  empowering consumers for the green transition”. Now it is time for 
  the European Parliament and Council to start its reading and come to 
  a conclusion. We have written an open letter to help them do things 
  right and use the European Week for Waste Reduction (EWWR) to make 
  our voice heard!

  We want users to have the “The universal right to install any 
  software on any device” because the possibility to install a Free 
  Software operating system can help users to overcome software 
  obsolescence and to extend hardware lifetimes. That is why the 
  universal right to freely choose operating systems, software and 
  services is crucial for a more sustainable digital society.
