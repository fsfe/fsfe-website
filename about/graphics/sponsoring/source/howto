To generate logos for a given year:

run
./genyear.sh year outputdir

Where year is the the year for which the buttons should be generated, preferably a 4 digit number but something lile "Mar 18" or 2018/03 would work as well.

Where outputdir is the name of a directory where the files will be generated. If outputdir is not given, it defaults to the current dir. The directory must already exist, it will *not* be automatically created by the script.

Make sure that button_template.svg is available when you run the script.

Note:
generate-all.sh and sponsoring_buttons.svg are DEPRECATED.
