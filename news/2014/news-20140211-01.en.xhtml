<p newsteaser="yes">On 14th February, the Free Software Foundation Europe 
asks all Free Software users to think about the dedicated hard-working 
people in the Free Software community and to show them their appreciation <a 
href="/news/2013/news-20130221-01.html">like last year</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Every day, we use Free Software and often take it for 
granted. We write bug reports, tell others how they should improve their 
software, or ask them for new features. Often we are not shy about 
criticising. So, to let the people in Free Software receive a positive 
feedback once a year, there is the 'I love Free Software day'." 
says FSFE's vice president Matthias Kirschner, who initiated the <a href=
"http://ilovefs.org">#ilovefs campaign</a> in 2010.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the <a href="http://ilovefs.org">"I love Free Software Day"</a> the 
FSFE has several suggestions how to show your love creatively to the people 
behind Free Software, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write an e-mail or letter to contributors expressing how much you like 
  what they are doing.</li>

  <li>Share your feelings about Free Software in social networks and 
  microblogs using <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ilovefs">#ilovefs
  </a>. Or write a blog post about your favourite Free Software application.
  </li>

  <li>Buy your favourite contributor a drink. Or buy someone else a drink 
  and while enjoying it, tell her/him about your favourite Free Software 
  program.</li>

  <li>Give a contributor a hug (ask for permission first). You might wonder 
  how many Free Software developers live in your area!</li>

  <li>Help us collecting quotes for our <a href= 
  "/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/whylovefs.html">testimonials of people loving 
  Free Software</a>. Ask developers, artists, politicians, or other users to 
  send their quote to contact@fsfe.org.</li>

  <li>Take a picture of yourself showing your feelings for Free Software, 
  and post them online.</li>

  <li>Donate to <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/DonateToFreeSoftwareProjects">Free Software initiatives</a> 
  or <a href= "https://my.fsfe.org/donate">to FSFE</a>
  to express your gratitude. They depend on your contribution to continue 
  their work. So check out your favourite organisation and make a donation. 
  You can be sure they will love you back.</li>

  <li>Finally you can help spread the love by sharing the <a href="/campaigns/ilovefs/artwork/artwork.html">campaign banners</a>, by e-mail, 
  (micro)blog or by spreading through any social network (please use the 
  hashtag #ilovefs for this).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>"Free Software gains its strenghts by the community and 
the ability to work together and join forces." says Matthias Kirschner. "We should not underestimate 
the power of a simple "thank you" for people who are easing our everyday 
work. So say thank you on 14th 
February!"</p></blockquote>
