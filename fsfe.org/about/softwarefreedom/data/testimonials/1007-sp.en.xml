    ”At a time where our individual autonomy and privacy are being increasingly
challenged even by our own democratic representatives, the idea of software that
guarantees the digital self-sovereignty of each individual is needed more than ever.
Without it, we are constantly watched for profit and control even by the devices we
own. The GNU Project was the torch-bearer for this idea of digital self-sovereignty,
whether it is called free software, open source or software freedom, and in
celebrating its 40th anniversary we are also celebrating our own liberty.”
