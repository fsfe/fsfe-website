		<h2>About Repentinus</h2>

		<p>
			Repentinus became involved with FSFE in 2011 as a translator. Over
			time his focus has shifted to website management and the
			<a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/pdfreaders.html">PDF readers campaign</a>.
			However, he can still be spotted committing an occasional Estonian
			translation. Furthermore, he continues to keep a close watch on the
			translators mailing list to make sure that new translators get all
			the support they need.
		</p>

		<p>
			In <a href="/news/2013/news-20130319-01.html">March 2013</a>,
			Repentinus was elected the
			<a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org/">Fellowship</a> Representative
			for the following two years. As the Fellowship Representative,
			Repentinus wishes to improve the infrastructure for the Fellows
			and encourage Fellows to become more involved in the affairs of FSFE.
