          <p>
              You have an Android phone and its manufacturer does not offer you any recent updates? You are faced with
              the dilemma of either buying a new phone or keeping an outdated device running? Learn on this page
              <strong>how you can install and use a Free Software operating system on your phone</strong> that keeps
              your device up to date.
          </p>

          <p>
              Installing a Free Software operating system means you often have more control over how long to use your
              device. In addition, it comes with a lot of other benefits. <strong>Free Software gives you full control
              over your device</strong>, you can finally de-install apps you could not before, and you profit from
              extended privacy protection - just to mention a few.
          </p>
      </div>
        <p>
            You can choose among several Android-based Free Software operating systems (also called custom ROMs) or even install a complete
            GNU/Linux environment. Different operating systems come with different focuses. Some focus on giving users
            as much freedom as possible, others on privacy, on usability, and more. You can choose for yourself
            which operating system best suits your needs. Enjoy the feeling of a new operating system; it's just like
            having a new device.
        </p>
        <p>
        To have a liberated device you need both <a href="#OS">the 
        OS</a> and <a href="#Apps">the Apps</a> to be free. To achieve 
        this you can either:
    </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Liberate your current phone by installing a free OS (<a href="#OS">OS options below</a>)
	</li>
    <li>
    Purchase a new phone that can be liberated (list of compatible phones for each OS below)
    </li>
	<li>
	Purchase a phone that already ships with Free Software <a 
	href="#FactoryFreePhones">(list of new devices below)</a>

		  <p>
                  For beginners, the easiest way is to start with liberating
                  your phone from proprietary apps. There are dedicated Free
                  Software app stores that offer free apps for the most
                  common use cases, for example messaging, navigation,
                  or games.

        <div class="half last">
          <h3><a href="#OS">Operating Systems</a></h3>
		  <p>
		  Most operating systems on phones you can buy are not free. They contain
      pre-installed proprietary software which limit your freedoms and harm your
      privacy. Advanced users should therefore install a mobile operating system
      that is as free as possible.

		  <p>
        A few devices are already shipped with Free Software by default,
        so you don't need to liberate them. This is the easiest option for non-technical users.

      <h2 id="Apps">The apps</h2>
      <p>
        For most people, the Google Play Store is the only or the main source for their
        applications. It doesn't even tell you whether an app is Free Software
        or not, let alone its license. Unfortunately, most apps from this or
        other markets are proprietary. Even if you install a Free Software app,
        there is no reason to trust the downloaded binary. Using Google
        Play also requires a Google account, which is itself proprietary software.
        We recommend to not use this market at all.
      </p>

      <p>
          After upcycling your phone and installing a Free Software operating system on it, you have the choice to
          manually install non-free software that might affect your freedom and privacy. This is true for GNU/Linux
          systems as well as custom ROMs. In the latter case you could even re-install the Google software and libraries
          again. But you do not have to! <strong>Keep control over your software and data and use your phone with as
          many Free Software apps as possible.</strong> For many users, liberating their phones is just the beginning of
          a long journey into a world full of Free Software.
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>Any proprietary app that you can replace with a Free Software one is an important step</strong>
          towards a more sustainable digital environment, because any Free Software app you download and install will
          attract developers to invest more resources in further development of the app. And any proprietary app that you
          replace with a Free Software app is one step out of the dilemma of software obsolescence - as outlined in our
          study <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">On the Sustainability of Free Software</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>In GNU/Linux environments, discovering the full world of Free Software on your mobile phone with
              ease</strong> usually works via their integrated software repository. In the case of custom ROMs, your
          journey starts with a Free Software app store called <strong>F-Droid</strong> and a replacement for the Google
          libraries called <strong>MicroG</strong>. If you are looking for enjoyable and useful apps you can find
          inspiration by <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/">browsing the F-Droid store</a> or you can look for
          curated third-party catalogues like <a href="https://fossdroid.com/">Fossdroid</a> or <a

                    <h3>F-Droid</h3>
                    <p>
                        The F-Droid initiative has completely changed and facilitated Free Software app availability in
                        the Android world by offering a repository of easily-installable Free Software apps for the
                        Android platform. In practice this means that you can <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/">use
                        F-Droid</a> in a similar way to what you might have experienced when using Google Play Store or
                        other app stores. F-Droid makes it easy to browse Free Software applications, install or
                        uninstall them onto your device, and keep track of updates. Apps available on F-Droid do not contain hidden
                        costs and are transparent about possible <a href="https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/AntiFeatures">antifeatures</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even if you are still using your stock Android: <strong>Installing Free
                        Software apps is possible on any type of Android phone.</strong> You can simply
                        install <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> and immediately enjoy the biggest Free Software app
                        store in the Android world! Browsers, maps, games, music, chats and
                        more, everything in one place! Every app you replace with Free
                        Software reduces your dependencies on non-free software.

In practice that means <a href="https://microg.org/">MicroG</a> allows other Free Software apps to seamlessly integrate into the Android system without having to use Google software for this. Free Software users get extended application support, privacy-caring users can reduce or monitor data that is sent to Google and especially older phones can expect some battery life improvements.</p></div>

  <h2 id="OS">The operating systems</h2>
      <p>
        An operating system is a collection of software that enables you to use
        your phone and run other applications on it. Even though Android is <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html">partially
        free</a>, many phones ship with proprietary components and add-ons.</p>

      <p>
          Some phones are easier to liberate than others. That is because some manufacturers make it artificially
          difficult for you, for example by using heavy <a href="https://drm.info">digital restrictions management</a>.
          Often they want you to have to buy a new phone instead of renewing your current
          one. Therefore, many manufacturers also want to discourage you from flashing your phone by claiming that you
          will lose your warranty. However, <a href="/activities/android/is-flashing-legal.html" title="Does
          rooting your phone invalidate its warranty?">according to
          the analysis of legal experts at FSFE</a>, this will often not be true.
      </p>

      <p>
          To be able to flash your phone with a Free Software operating system, you sometimes need to unlock the
          bootloader of your device. The bootloader is an underlying software level on top of which you install the
          operating system. On some phones it is easy to unlock the bootloader, on others not. Some operating systems
          can be installed without unlocking the bootloader, others not. Please note that we cannot offer you online or
          remote help with this process. But you are welcome to participate in one of <a
              href="/activities/android/workshops.html">our workshops</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
          If you currently need to buy a new phone it is recommended to choose your phone also based on the ease of
          flashing it. Not only do you make an easier time for yourself but also you support more Free Software phones with
          your choice. There are also several phones that come with GNU/Linux systems or a custom ROM pre-installed.
          This is of course the easiest option since they take away all the burden and offer you an easy-to-use
          experience.
      </p>

    <p>
        You can install a Free Software operating system on your device yourself. This process is also called flashing.
        Keep in mind that this might be not an
        easy task when you do it for the first time. It needs some preparation and research in advance. There is however
        plenty of information and help available from diverse communities, on the Internet and locally. And if you like
        tinkering around with technology, you can have fun installing Free Software on your phone pretty soon.

      <h3 id="beyondandroid">Beyond Android</h3>
      <p>
          Despite currently being the world's most used operating system on mobile phones, <strong>Android is by far not
          the only Free Software mobile operating system you can use</strong>. If you are curious, there is a lot more
          to discover. This means you do not need to install any Android based custom-ROM to liberate. Instead,
          <strong>you can install complete GNU/Linux systems or other Linux-based environments on your phone</strong>
          (if supported).
      </p>
      <p>
          GNU/Linux operating systems usually put freedom first, and their development is totally separate from the
          Google-dominated Android ecosystem. Even better, the code development does not rely on any other single
          company either: GNU/Linux systems are developed transparently by large communities around the globe with no
          single entity that is in control. Code changes can be proposed by any volunteer around the world, and any
          accepted change is directly visible to everyone. Many developers put efforts into offering backward
          compatibility of changes and using GNU/Linux you will benefit from many years of support for the operating
          system on your device.
      </p>

      <p>
          Choosing a GNU/Linux system for your phone means that some available apps will be different from what you're
          used to. This might be subject to change in the future though, as more and more Linux based operating systems
          enter the market. Also you can use <a href="https://waydro.id/">third-party software to bridge</a> between
          native Android apps and GNU/Linux systems or the other way around. However, the more Android apps you decide to
          bridge and use in your free GNU/Linux operating system, the more you start suffering again from restrictions
          in the Android world. Sticking to native GNU/Linux apps on your system usually means benefiting from using
          Free Software and Open Standards. And as more GNU/Linux systems become available on mobile phones, their
          markets and developments are expected to grow further.

      Even though this page is focused on liberating your current Android 
      phone, if you are looking to buy a new device, you should also be 
      aware that there are factory free devices in the market that are 
      already sold Free and don't require you to do anything to them 
      after you purchase them.

      Pixel device with GrapheneOS installed, so you don't need to do

      </p>
      
      <h3 id="linuxphones">GNU/Linux Phones</h3>
      <p>
      If you enjoy diversity and experimenting with technology, many more
      options are available to you. GNU/Linux phones may one day become a
      third option alongside iOS and Android. However, today they are still
      under heavy development so are still considered to be in beta, so they
      might not be the most suitable option for standard users yet. For those
      who like to be at the edge of the curve, we currently have the <a
      href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/">Purism Librem 5</a> and 
      the <a 
      href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">Pine 64 
      Pinephone</a>.
      Librem 5 currently ships with PureOS and the Pinephone ships with 
      Manjaro, even though multiple other distributions are supported.
      The PinePhone wiki, for example,
      <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PinePhone_Software_Releases">currently
      lists 21 different Free Software operating systems available</a>
      running on the PinePhone. And a growing number of companies offer
      pre-installed GNU/Linux systems on selected phones, including a
      precisely tailored app environment.
      </p>
      <p>
      On a Linux phone you can install many Linux distributions and the 
      same software you can install on any Linux PC.
      Additionally, installation of Android apps on Linux phones is also 
      possible thanks to emulators like <a 
      href="https://anbox.io/">Anbox</a> or the newer and more efficient
