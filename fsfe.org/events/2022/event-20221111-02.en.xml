      <p>We all love the digital freedoms that Free Software grants to users and developers, but these freedoms rely on legal instruments and the legal system to be able to enforce them. This is why the FSFE offers a Legal Education Track in SFScon. We will explain basic legal concepts and their practical application into your projects.</p>
