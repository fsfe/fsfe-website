<p><img src="/order/promotion/joinfellowship-poster_thumb.png" style="text-align:left"></img>Our "Join the Fellowship" Poster. A good poster to pin on a prominent place, for example inside a Hackerspace, and for use at any public activity. Size A1.</p>

<p><img src="/order/promotion/fellowhip-folder_thumb.png" style="text-align:left" />Our Fellowship <span style="font-weight:bold">folder</span> that contains core information about FSFE, Free Software and how to contribute. There is an English and a German version available. Both are in size A4 and in size A5 available. Both are made to contain additional information.
