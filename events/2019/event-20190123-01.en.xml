		<title>Eurocities Knowledge Society Forum 23 January 2019 Barcelona</title> 
 
		<body> 
			<p>This panel is in the context of the Eurocities Knowledge Society Forum meeting that will be held in Barcelona on 23-25 January 2019, and coordinated from the Technology and Digital Innovation Office of Barcelona City Council.

Eurocities is the network of more than 140 governments of the major European cities. Barcelona will host the meeting of the thematic group Knowledge Society and will focus on Digital Ethical Standards, Technological Sovereignty and Responsible Artificial Intelligence in cities.

Almost everybody agrees on the idea that PUBLIC MONEY should lead to PUBLIC SOFTWARE. Some cities have written their digital policies that include this commitment. It is well known that non-market mechanisms clearly outperform market-based ones in areas such as education or health
care. However, government tech continues being stubbornly dominated by market mechanisms and private software.</p>
