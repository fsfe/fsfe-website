<p>
  The City of Dortmund is embracing its role as a pioneer for digital 
  sovereignty through Free Software (also known as Open Source): 
  Together with Berlin and Munich, Dortmund has initialised the "Open 
  Source Big 3". In addition, at the beginning of next year, a 
  <a href="https://rathaus.dortmund.de/dosys/doRat.nsf/DrucksacheXP.xsp?drucksache=23758-22">"Coordination Office for Digital Sovereignty 
  and Open Source" will be set up in Dortmund in 2023</a> under 
  the Chief Information/Innovation Officer (CIO) of the city administration,
  as the city council of Dortmund <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clckdf7QZ8E&amp;t=14489s">decided today</a>. 
  Through this coordination office, open source governance is to be 
  developed as a cross-sectional task of the administration in 
  cooperation with the Kommunale Gemeinschaftsstelle für 
  Verwaltungsmanagement (KGSt). Due to the involvement of KGSt, this 
  development will also be relevant for all other municipalities in 
  Germany.
</p>

<p>
  With the increasing collaboration of administrations in Free Software 
  development, the development platform "Open CoDE" tailored 
  to the public sector is gaining in importance. This opens up new 
  perspectives for cooperation with communities. Conscious community 
  building is necessary for the administrations. Moreover, the “Open 
  Source Big 3” partnership should not be limited to three cities in 
  the future, but can turn out to become the "Open Source Big 
  X" with other municipalities joining.
</p>

<p>
  We would like to invite you to an online event in which we will talk 
  about these current developments and decisions. We will also discuss 
  what opportunities and challenges arise for Dortmund and other 
  municipalities throughout Germany. Interested persons - not only from 
  Dortmund - are invited to join us!
</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> 11.01.2023, 4:00 - 5:00 p.m. CET</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://registration.fsfe.org/Dortmund">https://registration.fsfe.org/Dortmund</a></p>

<p>
  Free Software gives everyone the right to use, study, share and 
  improve applications for any purpose. These freedoms ensure that 
  similar applications do not have to be programmed from scratch every 
  time and, thanks to transparent processes, others do not have to 
  reinvent the wheel. In large projects, expertise and costs can be 
  shared and applications paid for by the general public are available 
  to all. This promotes innovation and saves tax payers money in the 
  medium to long term. Dependencies on vendors are minimised and 
  security issues can be fixed more easily. The Free Software 
  Foundation Europe, together with over 200 organisations, is therefore 
  calling for "Public Money? Public Code!" - If it is public 
  money, it should be public code as well. More information on the 
  initiative on the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">“Public Money? 
  Public Code!” website</a>.
