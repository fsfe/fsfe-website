    <title>Software patents putting International Financial Report Standards (IFRS) in danger</title>
    <body>
     Open Letter to staunchly pro-software patent European Information &amp; Communications Technology Industry

software patents pose a threat to the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), as all the ideas used in these standards will be implemented
in software and would therefore be patentable."
