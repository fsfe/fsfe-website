    <h1>Our Donors 2014</h1>

    <p id="introduction">
      We would like to thank everyone who supports our work. Your
      <a href="/contribute/contribute.html">contributions as volunteer</a>,
      <a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org">Fellow</a> or sponsor make our work possible. Distributed
      support secures our independence, which is why every small contribution is important. Either
      publicly show <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">your donation</a> with
      <a href="/about/graphics/sponsoring/sponsoring.html">our sponsoring graphics</a> or remain
      anonymous.

    <h2>Further Donors</h2>

    <p>
      We also would like to thank those donors who preferred to remain anonymous, and the hundreds of
      donors and Fellows who donated smaller amounts, many of them throughout many years. Every
      financial contribution, no matter how big or small, is important for our work, and in fact,
      these numerous smaller donations make up for one third of our total funds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hardware donations are listed on our
      <a href="hardware.html">Hardware Donation website</a>. There, you can
      also find Information on how to support us with hardware.
