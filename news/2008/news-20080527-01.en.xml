	  <title>GPL-Violations.org and FSFE's Freedom Task Force to work more closely together</title>
    <body>
"It is a clear, legal fact that distributing Free Software means
people must comply with the licences.  GPL-Violations.org and the FTF
are now building the long-term legal infrastructure for support and
compliance" comments Harald Welte.  Shane Coughlan adds "I believe our
new agreement will help ensure sustainability for legal infrastructure
to support Free Software in Europe."
