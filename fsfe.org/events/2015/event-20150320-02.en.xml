   <title>Karsten Gerloff on Free Software and compliance</title>
   <body>
     <p>
   On March 20, FSFE's president Karsten Gerloff will discuss Free
   Software and compliance at a seminar in Tokyo, Japan. As Free
   Software permeates ever more areas of commercial activity,
   it is important for companies to understand what they need to do in
   order to fulfil their obligations under Free Software licenses, and
   to develop best practices to manage the use of Free Software in
   their products.
