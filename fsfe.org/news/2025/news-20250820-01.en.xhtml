	<h1>Legal Corner: Bringing SumUp to compliance: a case study of license enforcement</h1>

<p>What happens when those who benefit from the four freedoms fail to 
comply with the terms of a Free Software license? Today we take a look 
at the experience of license enforcement by one of our FSFE volunteers 
against the fintech company SumUp, and examine the lessons that 
supporters of Free Software can take away from it.</p>

<h3>Enforcing your rights under a Free Software license</h3>

<p>The <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html#freedoms">four freedoms of 
Free Software</a> are important foundations on which
user freedom in a digital society is built upon. In practice, the four
freedoms in a particular piece of software are recognized, legitimized,
and supported by the legal system through the application of a <a href="/freesoftware/legal/faq.html#license">Free
Software license</a>. However, like many other rights, the four freedoms
will merely be pipe dreams if they are not enforced and complied
with.</p>

<p>Because of the construction of Free Software licenses as permissions
granted by the copyright holder of the software, the use of Free
Software creates a kind of legal relationship between the copyright
holder and the user. Violating the terms of a Free Software license
therefore results in legal consequences, including revocation of the
license to the specific violating user or demands for corrective
actions, the specific performance of the software license, and
lawsuits.</p>


<div class="standout-text-bggreen">“Specific performance” is a legal term referring to the act
of fulfilling a requirement in a legal agreement in exactly the way that
it is specified in that agreement. </div>

<p>It is important not to conceptualize software license violations
simply as individual users not complying with the license of a single
software project. The widespread use of Free Software licensed
components in many significant commercial software products means that
violators can often be large companies and organizations. Because of
this, enforcement of Free Software rights against larger violating
entities in practice can feel daunting and intimidating for many
individual users.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, ensuring that Free Software license terms are complied
with is ultimately a crucial factor contributing to the adherence of the
four freedoms. Enforcement is therefore an important stepping stone to
achieving the transparency, autonomy, and liberty that we value so much
in software freedom.</p>

<h3>Bringing SumUp to compliance: how it started</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.sumup.com/">SumUp</a> is a financial tech company that produces payment terminals and
other point-of-sale systems used primarily by business entities for
financial transactions, as well as the corresponding software that is
loaded into them. One of SumUp’s products is the <a href="https://store.sumup.com/product-selection/card_reader.solo_bundle_cradle_v2">SumUp 
Solo (the Solo)</a>,
a contactless payment terminal with many digital and software components
that facilitate its operation.</p>

<p>In July of 2024, German FSFE team member <a href="/about/people/index.html">Nicole Faerber</a>’s place of
work acquired a Solo payment card terminal. Nicole noticed that neither
the documentation for the Solo, nor the software provided, nor the SumUp
website provided any Free Software disclosures. In other words, Nicole
noticed that users of the Solo: </p>

<ol>
<li>did not have access to any identification of Free Software
components present in the retail version of the Solo device;
</li>
<li>did not have access to the corresponding licensing information
related to these Free Software components;</li>
<li>
did not have access to any copyright notices conveying information about 
copyright ownership of these Free Software components;
</li>
<li>were not provided any offers for the source code.</li>
</ol>

<p>This lack of disclosure was curious, especially as Nicole was aware
of <a href="https://hackaday.io/atc1441">the work of Aaron 
Christophel</a>, a German engineer who showcases how he
disassembles and tinkers with his various devices. In 2023, Christophel
<a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/03/01/aaron-christophel-brings-doom-to-payment-terminal/">took 
apart a Solo device</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vJX80dyMp0">demonstrated how he 
was able to find
several security issues with the device</a>. Of interest as well was that
Christophel’s disassemble showed that the Solo was working off of an
Open Root Shell and a Linux system, which would imply a certain level of
necessary Free Software disclosure, as well as corresponding source
code, to its users. </p>

<p>With this in mind, Nicole privately obtained her own Solo, and
conducted her own investigation into the device. In addition to the
Linux kernel, she found that the device also functioned with a lot of
Free Software, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>U-Boot (<a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-or-later.html">licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later</a>);</li>
<li>BusyBox (licensed under GPL-2.0-only); and</li>
<li>
glibc (<a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1-or-later.html">licensed under 
LGPL-2.1-or-later</a>), etc etc.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Correspondence with SumUp</h3>

<p>With the knowledge that the Solo was loaded with numerous Free
Software components, and that the lack of any FOSS disclosures meant
that the Solo device was not in compliance with its license obligations,
Nicole contacted SumUp support. She requested their compliance through
disclosure and provision of the “complete corresponding source code”
(CCS). The initial response was that such information was protected by
copyright and constituted trade secrets, and accordingly her request
would not be fulfilled. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, Nicole persisted with following up emails explaining
the principles of Free Software and its licensing, and the general
obligations that SumUp is obliged to comply with by including Free
Software components in their devices. Without divulging too much
information about the internal state of their licensing affairs, SumUp
eventually responded that they were working on licensing compliance and
would get back to Nicole as soon as they could.</p>

<p>Despite this, almost half a year after her initial contact and
request, Nicole still had not received any disclosures by December 2024,
nor the CCS from SumUp. In a follow-up response to indicate that she had
not forgotten their obligations and her request, Nicole specified to
SumUp that if their inability to provide the CCS as well as proper FOSS
disclosure persisted, this could void their rights to continue properly
and legally retailing their Solo devices. In response, SumUp asked
Nicole to provide the legal basis for her statements, despite such
information being readily available online.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, SumUp finally provided some initial disclosure
documentation to Nicole as well as what they claimed to be the CCS for
the Solo device. Such disclosures were insufficient, as the disclosure
document was provided directly and only to Nicole, and not on a public
forum, and the source code provided appeared to be incomplete. Nicole
therefore requested that SumUp do the disclosures locally on the Solo
devices themselves, by adding something in the Solo user interface that
displays a list of software components, as well as all required
licensing and copyright information. </p>

<p>In June 2025, after almost a year since the initial contact made with
SumUp, Nicole finally received a USB stick <a href="https://disco.haeckserei.de/archive/SumUp/SumUp%20Solo/">containing 
the required
disclosures and the CCS</a>. Additionally, SumUp also updated their Solo
device software to now show the relevant FOSS disclosures, and also to
indicate where users will be able to access the CCS. </p>
<p>While some additional work is required to ensure if this provided
information is fully accurate and fully compliant, this is nevertheless
a positive outcome that contributes to SumUp’s users being able to enjoy
software freedom. </p>

<h3>Summing Up the SumUp experience</h3>
<p><u>Enforcement requests can in egregious situations take time to yield
results</u>: In general, Nicole’s experience tells us that, unfortunately,
enforcement against a violator can often take a fair amount of time
before there can be any substantial change from a violator that yields
concrete compliance results. This is particularly because if the
violator had not paid attention to licensing requirements before, it
will take a lot of work for a large project to come into compliance.
Additionally, internal administrative procedures can also play a part in
slowing down the overall compliance process.</p>

<p><u>Expect to be told that default copyright protections apply</u>: Another
factor that contributes to these delays is the defensiveness that many
violators are prone to display when confronted with their
non-compliance. Copyright protections are generally more well-known to
the general public, relative to Free Software licensing. Because of
this, a typical knee-jerk reaction experienced when requesting
disclosure or CCS would be to invoke copyrights and trade secrets as a
tactic, as was the case here with SumUp. </p>

<p><u>Bear in mind which department you are speaking with</u>: Defaulting to
the argument that the CCS cannot be shared because it is “copyrighted”,
“trade secrets”, or other legal jargon, happens also because, especially
when dealing with larger organizations, it is quite likely that the
first contact you will have is usually with a customer service
representative operating from a generic contact email address. The first
response to a license compliance request will therefore not usually be
entirely productive, unless you have a direct contact to those who have
the requisite expertise in licensing to fully understand the context of
a license compliance request. </p>

<div class="standout-text-bggreen">Indeed, if you would like to expedite your own enforcement
process of a particular company violator, it is generally a good idea to
look for the contacts of people working either in a software development
or legal capacity within that company. You can try to find this
information from various sources, including the “About” pages of the
company website, publicly available employee personal pages, or from
public repositories such as GitHub where the company in question may
have contributed to.</div>

<p><u>Non-compliance is not necessarily a malicious act</u>: It is important to
keep in mind that violations are not necessarily malicious; often times,
non-compliance with Free Software license terms are based in ignorance
of best practices. Additionally, even if you get through to those
specifically dealing with legal issues in a non-compliant organization,
there is unfortunately also a fair amount of misunderstanding or
ignorance of Free Software legal and licensing issues within the legal
profession. As Hanlon’s Razor states: “Never attribute to malice that
which can adequately be explained by incompetence”.</p>

<p><u>“Accidental/unintentional non-compliance” is nevertheless losing
credibility</u>: That being said, Hanlon’s Razor is merely a general
observation, not an immutable natural law. Conversations and information
around Free Software licensing have grown significantly in the past few
decades, and many professional software developers and IT lawyers should
have a passing understanding of Free Software licensing and the
obligations that come with it. Ignorance as a defence can therefore only
go so far, and especially with large entities handling large projects,
can often cease to be credible.</p>

<p>In certain cases, it is also possible that companies have
strategically neglected their licensing obligations for a number of
reasons. One possibility is that putting in the work to ensure full
disclosure and compliance might take up too much time, effort, and/or
cost, and a particular company may choose to ignore the problem in
favour of utilizing their workforce in other priorities. </p>
<p>We should always keep in mind that the reasons given by a violator
may explain past non-compliance, but it should never be used to justify
and/or excuse continued and ongoing non-compliance. For individuals
seeking compliance, it may nonetheless ultimately be more productive and
worthwhile to focus on practical strategies that ensure that the end
result is compliance, rather than to assign blame.</p>

<h3>Some tips for when you are enforcing your rights</h3>

<p>Bearing all the observations above in mind, if you suspect that an
organization is violating the obligations of a Free Software license, by
withholding disclosure or the CCS, and you’d like to enforce these
license obligations by requesting Free Software disclosure, here are
some things to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Be aware of the kinds of Free Software components present in the
systems that you are seeking the source code for. This allows you to
also understand which Free Software licenses apply for the device or
software in question, and therefore the precise license obligations that
the potential violator is under. Awareness of your legal rights, and
their legal obligations to provide disclosure, will allow you to be more
assertive in pushing for compliance.</p>

<p>You should also be prepared for efforts by violators to resist making
substantive changes to their practices that would result in compliance,
and sometimes can resort to defensive measures in an attempt to stop
your enforcement efforts. Persistence is unfortunately necessary in
order to see the process through to your end goal of proper
disclosure.</p>

<p>Additionally, the FSF and the SFC have also developed <a href="https://www.fsf.org/licensing/enforcement-principles">the 
Principles
of Community-Oriented GPL-Enforcement (the Principles)</a>, which lays out
their recommendations on how community users can go about enforcing
licensing obligations in a manner that enables users to understand the
violator’s situation without excusing the violation, but rather to allow
for collaboration to bring the violator into compliance. </p>

<p>An important takeaway as well from the FSF and SFC’s perspective in
creating these Principles is that the focus of enforcement processes
should always be on bringing about compliance with licensing
obligations. Indeed, they stress that: </p>

<p>“[c]opyleft licenses do not state specific enforcement methodologies
(other than license termination itself) in part because the real world
situation of GPL violations varies; rigidity impedes success.</p>

<p>In particular, this list of principles purposely does not seek to
create strict criteria and/or “escalation and mediation rules” for
enforcement action. Efforts to do that limit the ability of copyright
holders to use copyleft licenses for their intended effect: to stand up
for the rights of users to copy, modify, and redistribute free
software.”</p>

<h3>Concluding remarks</h3>
<p>Free Software licensing formalizes our ability as users to enjoy the
four freedoms of Free Software. Without proper adherence to these
licensing obligations, and without the ability to enforce these rights,
the proper and guaranteed enjoyment of our user freedoms will be at
risk.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the history of Free Software license enforcement has
shown that often, large amounts of effort has to be expended in order to
for users to be able to properly enjoy these freedoms. Nicole’s
experience in this example is indicative of how much time and effort
currently needs to be spent in order to effectively enjoy what is
actually a legal right for users, especially from larger companies that
work with digital technology.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this example does indicate that some positive changes
have taken hold in the past decades since the early days of GPL
enforcement, where compliance had to be litigated in, and enforced by,
the courts. In this example case, despite being initially defensive and
protective over their CCS and Free Software disclosures, SumUp has since
been relatively proactive in taking steps to ensure Free Software
license compliance with their devices, which is always good to see. This
can be indicative that companies are progressively becoming more aware
of Free Software legal requirements, and growing awareness of their
obligations to comply.</p>

<p>We therefore encourage all our readers to start asking questions
about your devices and the software that they contain. When more users
hold vendors of digital technologies accountable, even if it is just
through a simple request for the CCS and Free Software disclosures, this
can be a way to force companies to have to substantively conceptualize
and understand their obligations in a digital society where openness and
collaboration has been baked into many of the software components that
enable their products to function.</p>

<p>Nicole’s efforts show that individuals can have outsized positive
impacts on software freedom, and many little steps like Nicole’s, when
taken together, can amount to a large enough movement to further develop
the Free Software ecosystem in a positive direction.</p>
