Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:17.920 --&gt; 00:22.320
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe, where a charity

00:22.320 --&gt; 00:25.040
that empowers users to control technology.

00:25.040 --&gt; 00:28.640
I'm Matthias Kirschner, I'm the President of the Free Software Foundation Europe, and

00:28.640 --&gt; 00:31.440
I'm doing this podcast with my colleague Bonnie Mehring.

00:31.440 --&gt; 00:34.560
Hello, our guest for today is Elisa Lindinger.

00:34.560 --&gt; 00:39.440
Elisa is the Managing Director of Super, Lab and a freelancer researcher of technology

00:39.440 --&gt; 00:41.040
and culture.

00:41.040 --&gt; 00:46.320
In her work, she focuses on civil societies, and she has also consulted Free Software and

00:46.320 --&gt; 00:52.560
open infrastructure communities, as well as she has organized conferences and events.

00:52.560 --&gt; 00:57.520
As a trained archaeologist, Elisa has worked in the intersection of culture and computer

00:58.480 --&gt; 01:03.680
and in her current research, she focuses on open digital infrastructure and how social

01:03.680 --&gt; 01:08.160
practices, norms and values within tech communities shape its development.

01:08.800 --&gt; 01:10.400
Hello, Elisa, nice to meet you.

01:12.240 --&gt; 01:13.440
Hello, Bonnie, hi, Matthias.

01:14.240 --&gt; 01:15.920
Hi, and thank you for being with us, Elisa.

01:18.000 --&gt; 01:25.440
So, Elisa and Francesca, first, I was wondering you also worked on how communities around

01:25.440 --&gt; 01:30.800
Free Software can be supported, and so I was wondering what problems do you see that Free Software

01:30.800 --&gt; 01:32.560
contributors are facing?

01:36.560 --&gt; 01:42.160
I think one of the biggest problems that people kept telling me about during my research and

01:42.160 --&gt; 01:50.320
the interviews I conducted for those was a very old story that is very common to Free Software,

01:50.320 --&gt; 01:56.720
I believe, and that is the balance between developing new code and maintaining it,

01:57.360 --&gt; 02:00.800
because developing new code is on the one hand kind of attractive.

02:00.800 --&gt; 02:06.240
You know, it is this puzzle you have to solve, you make things working, and you get kind of an

02:06.240 --&gt; 02:11.120
instant gratification out of this. I think everyone of us knows this and can relate to that.

02:11.760 --&gt; 02:20.640
And on the other hand, you have a working product or a working code base, and people start

02:20.640 --&gt; 02:27.360
adopting it, which in the beginning is great to see, but then the more and more people adapt

02:27.360 --&gt; 02:33.120
this technology that you build, the more and more they demand things or ask for things,

02:33.120 --&gt; 02:38.320
wanted to work in this environment or that environment. And in the end, it's not anymore,

02:38.320 --&gt; 02:43.600
you know, building things that work, but keeping them from breaking all the time.

02:44.480 --&gt; 02:51.360
And you're not thanked as much anymore if you maintain your product, but it's more, you know,

02:51.360 --&gt; 02:55.840
you see all the complaints, all the tickets coming in, all the bug reports, and that can be really

02:55.840 --&gt; 03:02.800
tiring. It's also a problem when it comes to fundraising, you know, it's easier to get new

03:03.280 --&gt; 03:11.120
attention for like a new software, a new library. It's really hard to get this kind of attention

03:11.120 --&gt; 03:17.120
that also then gets financial rewards out of it for a product that is already there and that you

03:17.120 --&gt; 03:24.800
just, you know, with all strings attached. I'm not saying it's easy, but yeah, that you basically

03:24.800 --&gt; 03:32.640
just work to keep working. So that's something which is very common also in other areas that

03:32.800 --&gt; 03:37.440
new stuff, that's the stuff which people are interested in, they want to support you. And when

03:37.440 --&gt; 03:43.200
you talk about the same project again in a year or in five years, they say, oh, that's so old,

03:44.720 --&gt; 03:50.080
can't you start something new? But there are projects, there are, there is work where you have to

03:50.080 --&gt; 03:59.360
keep on working on them for many, many years, sometimes decades. So what can you do to motivate

04:00.080 --&gt; 04:07.200
contributors to do this work, which they don't like so much, like maintaining software they

04:07.200 --&gt; 04:14.400
wrote five years ago for the next five years? Yeah, good question. And I think there is no easy answer,

04:14.400 --&gt; 04:21.120
otherwise the smart people out there would already have found it. I believe that one key to solving

04:21.120 --&gt; 04:30.640
this problem is community management. To have a successful piece of software of code running

04:30.640 --&gt; 04:38.240
and keep it running, I believe you have to, you know, share it with a group of people who can

04:38.240 --&gt; 04:43.840
help each other out because none of us can be dedicated to a project 24, 7 over a decade or longer.

04:44.560 --&gt; 04:52.240
And this is, I think, also quite current that the older a project gets, while the

04:52.240 --&gt; 04:58.400
contribution numbers are dwindling and the people who actually contribute towards it are in the

04:58.400 --&gt; 05:03.920
single digits and that is just not sustainable. And this is actually interesting because one of

05:03.920 --&gt; 05:08.560
the stories that I love to tell about free software is that it is actually quite sustainable,

05:08.640 --&gt; 05:13.760
right? I mean, the energy footprint is quite low because you don't have, you don't have

05:13.760 --&gt; 05:22.320
blood wear usually at least. But then again, the working behind it is not very sustainable because

05:22.320 --&gt; 05:27.520
people are burnt out quite easily. And this is a phenomenon, I guess that we see all over the field

05:27.520 --&gt; 05:33.040
much more than in the IT sector in general. Why do you think that's different in free software than

05:33.040 --&gt; 05:41.680
in the general IT sector? I believe the structures are kind of different. I mean, you have company

05:41.680 --&gt; 05:49.200
structures in free software as well, of course, very successful ones. But you also have these

05:49.200 --&gt; 05:54.720
company structures with clear business hours, with paid leave and everything. But they work

05:54.720 --&gt; 06:00.400
closely together with communities of freelancers who have to take care of that on their own,

06:00.400 --&gt; 06:05.040
which is sometimes very hard to be mindful of yourself and of your health and your well-being.

06:05.680 --&gt; 06:11.360
And also volunteers who work at a different schedule, who work in different time zones,

06:11.360 --&gt; 06:18.320
so to bring all those different needs and also wishes that people bring to the table together.

06:18.320 --&gt; 06:23.280
I think for this you believe proper community management, people who take care of the well-being,

06:23.440 --&gt; 06:30.400
who facilitate, if there's a conflict or just a communication problem sometimes, and who also

06:30.400 --&gt; 06:36.240
take care that if new people come to a project, this is also something that we saw. There is a high

06:36.240 --&gt; 06:43.200
drop-off rate at the beginning because there are often no clear onboarding processes, how to

06:43.200 --&gt; 06:47.680
join a project and what you actually have to learn, who you can ask if you have a problem.

06:48.400 --&gt; 06:53.680
And the barriers of joining a mailing list where sometimes the tone can be a little rough,

06:54.880 --&gt; 07:00.000
yeah, those hurdles are actually quite high and many people don't make it that far.

07:03.040 --&gt; 07:09.040
But they have some concrete suggestions how the situation can be improved and what would be needed

07:09.040 --&gt; 07:13.600
that those who do volunteer work for open infrastructure and free software receive the support

07:13.600 --&gt; 07:18.320
they need, except of community management. Good question.

07:21.520 --&gt; 07:27.360
I heard in the interviews that many people who work on software projects are very dedicated,

07:27.360 --&gt; 07:32.080
but they complain about that they cannot do what they actually would like to do. So they are stuck

07:32.080 --&gt; 07:40.400
in the finances, in organizing events, in doing like travel organization or budgeting.

07:41.040 --&gt; 07:46.720
And I think this is something that came up so often in the interviews that this seems to be a

07:46.720 --&gt; 07:51.280
core problem. So community management really is just one part of it. Maybe it's an outward

07:51.280 --&gt; 07:56.960
facing part. This is why it seemed to be so visible to me, but there's more to that. So in order to

07:58.480 --&gt; 08:05.360
solve these problems that there are so many different tasks piled upon individual developers,

08:05.360 --&gt; 08:10.000
you need to diversify, you need to bring new people to a project with a different set of skills.

08:10.000 --&gt; 08:15.360
If you are a successful developer, you shouldn't be doing finances, you should be writing code.

08:16.240 --&gt; 08:20.960
And there are people who are really good at finances. That's their skill. Why not get these

08:20.960 --&gt; 08:26.720
experts on board? The same again with community management. There are experts for that who are

08:26.720 --&gt; 08:33.040
really good at this. Get them on board, but also acknowledge them for the skills and for the work

08:33.040 --&gt; 08:38.960
that they are doing. It's really hard to approach a project and say, hey, I've got no idea about

08:39.040 --&gt; 08:44.480
how software works, but I want to contribute with my skills. Who would these people even talk to

08:44.480 --&gt; 08:49.760
if they want to join a project? Because the way that you usually join is by starting to

08:49.760 --&gt; 08:57.200
committing code, right? And then you join the mailing list and you get part of the community,

08:57.200 --&gt; 09:02.880
and then you find your spot and see how you can contribute further. So I think this is really a

09:03.360 --&gt; 09:12.480
key problem. So make it a bit more about coming. Yeah, a little bit more open.

09:15.760 --&gt; 09:21.680
And Elisa, when you talk about that, it seems a bit, I mean, there are some steps which

09:22.400 --&gt; 09:29.280
companies can easier do like at a certain scale. They can say, well, beside those five developers,

09:29.280 --&gt; 09:34.800
we have on those projects. Let's now also get someone who is focusing on the community management

09:34.800 --&gt; 09:41.200
to include others in this project as well. While for volunteers who run projects, it's more

09:41.200 --&gt; 09:48.080
difficult to do this like one developer might attract another developer. Also, he doesn't like

09:48.080 --&gt; 09:55.200
to do community management. He will work in his small community of the two developers then,

09:55.200 --&gt; 10:01.440
then there might be a few more. But then, I mean, it's difficult when you are at a lower scale

10:01.440 --&gt; 10:07.200
to attract someone who loves doing community management because it's still a small community,

10:07.200 --&gt; 10:13.200
while it will not grow when you don't have someone doing it. So do you also see this chicken egg

10:13.200 --&gt; 10:21.760
problem there? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there is kind of a chicken egg problem. But I'm not quite sure

10:21.840 --&gt; 10:29.520
that people wouldn't volunteer if they have, if they are experts in community building to work

10:29.520 --&gt; 10:33.760
for a project that has a very small community. I think that is actually quite an attractive thing

10:33.760 --&gt; 10:38.960
to build up a new community and see how this can be made at a healthy environment for everyone.

10:39.840 --&gt; 10:49.360
So I really believe that if you start a problem, try to think ahead, not just in technical terms,

10:50.240 --&gt; 10:55.520
and in terms of technical scale, but also in terms of social scale, of team scale,

10:55.520 --&gt; 11:01.040
of outreach scale, and then see which people, which skills you need and reach out to them.

11:01.040 --&gt; 11:05.360
Because I believe those people are not there. This is not just about community building, it's

11:05.360 --&gt; 11:11.120
also about design. I don't know whether you've heard, but some people criticize the usability

11:11.120 --&gt; 11:15.920
of some free software projects. And I think this is something that we've heard over the past years as

11:16.400 --&gt; 11:20.640
well. Do you have examples there? I'm not sure if I've heard anything like that ever.

11:22.080 --&gt; 11:24.720
I would have to look them up, but I can send them over, yeah.

11:26.080 --&gt; 11:31.120
No, but this is also an ongoing theme, right? In the discussions about a free software,

11:31.120 --&gt; 11:39.760
why it isn't adopted as widely? Because there is a hands-on spirit to it. You have to

11:40.480 --&gt; 11:49.040
get in up to your elbows and be able to figure out problems and solve them on your own at some

11:49.040 --&gt; 11:57.920
point. And this is something that could be at least a little bit eliminated by getting

11:58.960 --&gt; 12:07.520
UX experts, professionals on board on a project earlier, to see how workflows break if people

12:07.520 --&gt; 12:11.600
don't bring a certain knowledge to the tables and where people drop off using your product.

12:12.320 --&gt; 12:17.360
And that, again, if you involve those people, would make your product more usable, it would also

12:17.360 --&gt; 12:20.960
broaden the user base, which is also kind of rewarding, right? I mean, you want to have a product

12:20.960 --&gt; 12:29.440
that gets a depth that you don't build code that is not used. So if I understood you correct,

12:29.520 --&gt; 12:37.760
you also argued before that all those other tasks around outside of the technical skills in

12:37.760 --&gt; 12:43.840
a project that they are sometimes undervalued by the people who have to do them, but who would

12:43.840 --&gt; 12:50.320
rather like to code. But your suggestion would be if you would like to run a free software project

12:50.320 --&gt; 12:55.520
and would like to develop something, and you can concentrate on the technical things, but you

12:55.520 --&gt; 13:01.200
should not forget about those other factors. And you should make sure to also consider them

13:01.200 --&gt; 13:07.200
and include people who would focus on this in order to make sure that your technical project

13:07.200 --&gt; 13:15.040
will be sustainable. Did I understand you correct there? I do agree with the second part. So yeah,

13:15.040 --&gt; 13:19.760
you definitely, if you start a project, should get all sorts of people to the table as early as you

13:19.760 --&gt; 13:24.800
can. Test often test early works in every kind of dimension, not just in the technical one.

13:25.840 --&gt; 13:35.840
I wouldn't exactly say that people, developers especially, undervalued these skills,

13:35.840 --&gt; 13:40.720
because once they have to do them themselves, they realize how hard they are to do.

13:41.600 --&gt; 13:46.320
It's just that it's not the first in their mind if they set up to do a new project. I think

13:46.320 --&gt; 13:50.240
this needs to change a little more like product thinking. I know this is a very business

13:50.240 --&gt; 13:56.240
term, but it's something that actually makes sense if you are developing products.

13:58.640 --&gt; 14:04.000
So at least have one other question. So there are also organizations out there like foundations

14:04.000 --&gt; 14:10.240
who want to support free software contributors. What way do they have to better support

14:10.320 --&gt; 14:17.200
free software development? First of all to all the foundations out there who are considering

14:17.200 --&gt; 14:22.560
supporting free software. Yes, please do. Your contribution is really, really needed and also

14:22.560 --&gt; 14:29.440
very welcome and valued. We recently published a report that tried to touch upon that subject a

14:29.440 --&gt; 14:37.280
little more. The report is called World Works ahead. And I'm sure we can link to it in the show notes.

14:38.160 --&gt; 14:43.760
And it outlines several recommendations for funders who want to interact and support

14:45.200 --&gt; 14:52.160
software communities out there. And maybe I'll just highlight a few of the most important

14:52.160 --&gt; 14:58.080
findings that we had. What we came across was kind of a circle of reinforcement

15:00.000 --&gt; 15:06.400
of a few problems that are evident in software communities. For example, this

15:06.400 --&gt; 15:11.520
concentration of people with skills in development that we already touched upon.

15:13.440 --&gt; 15:22.880
And foundations often support developer work, but don't really like to invest in these other

15:22.880 --&gt; 15:31.920
skills that I mentioned like UX design, translation, localization, community management, finances,

15:31.920 --&gt; 15:37.840
especially finances. Those positions are really hard to fund externally.

15:39.600 --&gt; 15:46.080
And at the other hand, the developers, of course, would like to support their own positions first.

15:46.080 --&gt; 15:50.880
I get that, but it also means that they are stuck with all these tasks. They don't really like to

15:50.880 --&gt; 15:58.080
do. So what I would like to see from funders is to actively encourage, to actively encourage

15:58.080 --&gt; 16:05.760
software projects to rethink their own structure and the positions that are covered by their

16:05.760 --&gt; 16:12.560
teams and what new positions need to be created and then, again, supported by foundations

16:12.560 --&gt; 16:16.960
to make the team more resilient and more healthy and more balanced.

16:18.320 --&gt; 16:22.400
Thank you, yeah. I think that's a very important point. And actually, there's also one

16:23.040 --&gt; 16:29.760
positive example there. We are involved in Horizon 2020 project, NGIS zero. And there they build

16:29.760 --&gt; 16:37.680
a consortium of organizations who are then also paid in this framework to support the development

16:37.680 --&gt; 16:44.160
projects, which are which get the funding there. And the other organizations then can help those

16:44.160 --&gt; 16:50.480
more technical people with other aspects like UX design, but also then about security,

16:50.480 --&gt; 16:57.760
with SDFSFE, we do help them with legal questions. And there are many different ones who support them

16:57.760 --&gt; 17:02.640
then in community building and so on, where then it's not just focusing on the technical part,

17:02.640 --&gt; 17:07.840
but then also on those other areas, which in the end are our important part for sustainable

17:07.840 --&gt; 17:11.280
growth and development of those technical tools there.

17:11.360 --&gt; 17:22.400
After we now talked about free software contributors and how the developing part of free software

17:22.400 --&gt; 17:30.080
needs support, you also had formalized some claims to support the work for a resilient and

17:30.080 --&gt; 17:34.800
sustainable digital infrastructure. So we are getting a more broad of you here now.

17:35.360 --&gt; 17:43.600
Well, could you summarize those for claims for us? Sure, yeah. But first, maybe let me give you a

17:43.600 --&gt; 17:54.240
short rundown how this actually happened, because all of us have been in this field of advocating for

17:54.240 --&gt; 18:01.440
free software for quite a long time. And if you now hear these demands, you will realize that

18:01.520 --&gt; 18:11.200
none of them are new. But when earlier this year, the COVID pandemic hit and we all, you know,

18:11.200 --&gt; 18:18.880
we're sent to our home offices and kids had to do school from home and we had to reach out to

18:18.880 --&gt; 18:26.400
our loved ones and friends, over digital platforms. I think society at a whole

18:27.040 --&gt; 18:37.200
and witnessed a digital transformation and I know that this is a very planned term that has

18:37.200 --&gt; 18:42.080
like digital transformation has been here since the 1970s and it still isn't done. I think it will

18:42.080 --&gt; 18:48.640
never be done. It's just we saw an acceleration of digitization in every aspect of our lives.

18:49.600 --&gt; 19:02.320
And all the good tools to manage this digital transformation are out there. We have good products,

19:02.960 --&gt; 19:08.400
but when push came to shove and things, you know, suddenly there was time pressure,

19:09.280 --&gt; 19:15.920
organizations, companies, families had to find tools that worked for them quickly. They did not

19:15.920 --&gt; 19:25.280
turn to free software at a rate that we all would have loved to see. Instead, we have this whole

19:25.280 --&gt; 19:32.160
zoom conversation over and over again. And I think there is no arguing that zoom is a problematic

19:32.160 --&gt; 19:40.320
tool, not just because of a lack of encryption or an unclear state of its encryption, the way it

19:40.320 --&gt; 19:47.120
routes its traffic through service in China, but also the way it now starts to censor online

19:47.120 --&gt; 19:56.000
discussions that discuss zoom, safety and security. This is a problem like we cannot be reliant on

19:56.000 --&gt; 20:04.240
these things that then censor our discussions about whether technology works. So when we saw this,

20:04.240 --&gt; 20:09.440
we thought, okay, we have made these demands over years and I know that the free software

20:09.440 --&gt; 20:14.240
foundation Europe has been one of the most outspoken advocates in the world about these topics.

20:15.200 --&gt; 20:21.520
But we thought, okay, now this is a good time to recap this and write it down once and for all

20:21.520 --&gt; 20:27.920
that there is good software out there. But there are a few things that people need to change,

20:27.920 --&gt; 20:37.040
politicians also need to change to make its adoption easier. So with this rather lengthy explanation,

20:37.840 --&gt; 20:45.760
we came down in a very collaborative process with a number of organizations, mostly from Germany,

20:45.760 --&gt; 20:54.400
but it was later signed by other organizations as well. We came down to four basic recommendations.

20:55.280 --&gt; 21:03.360
The first one is to open political decision-making processes for input from the digital civil

21:03.360 --&gt; 21:13.840
society. I believe that at least from my German perspective, it is very frustrating to see all these,

21:16.000 --&gt; 21:20.240
it's very frustrating to see all these commissions in the German parliament who discuss

21:21.520 --&gt; 21:30.960
several aspects of technology that are held without any involvement of civil society,

21:30.960 --&gt; 21:36.240
who will be most impacted by this technology in the end and this needs to change and we need to

21:36.240 --&gt; 21:44.080
involve civil society much earlier and not just in hindsight into the discussion how technology

21:44.080 --&gt; 21:55.280
is supported, how money is spent on technology and also how we make legislation around the regulation

21:55.280 --&gt; 22:01.200
of technology and I think this is something we would like to see. The second demand was,

22:01.200 --&gt; 22:08.480
the second recommendation was to have more targeted funding for digital civil society.

22:09.920 --&gt; 22:20.640
We have seen that with, for example, with a corona app that was developed by a consortium of

22:20.640 --&gt; 22:29.040
different actors, universities, a few companies, freelancers, that there was a broad discussion

22:29.040 --&gt; 22:39.840
in Germany whether this corona app will be made Open Source. You mean the German corona app, right?

22:39.840 --&gt; 22:44.720
The German corona app. What's mainly developed by Ted Deutsche Telekom and SAP, right?

22:45.680 --&gt; 22:52.960
I think that is the back end. Yeah, yeah, the back end. But in the beginning, so there was this idea

22:52.960 --&gt; 22:58.240
to, first there was this pitch that there will be just a closed source app, a proprietary app.

22:58.880 --&gt; 23:02.960
And then there was a broad discussion on Twitter but also then in the tabloids everywhere,

23:02.960 --&gt; 23:11.200
it was really broad that to have an application that people actually trust and are willing to use,

23:11.280 --&gt; 23:16.560
there needs to be some sort of transparency to this project and the best way to achieve this

23:16.560 --&gt; 23:21.120
would be to release the code publicly and put it on an open license.

23:22.560 --&gt; 23:26.720
And there was so much pressure done from civil society that this actually happened,

23:26.720 --&gt; 23:32.880
which is a good thing, at least for the front end application.

23:33.920 --&gt; 23:40.560
And this is something that civil society does in their free time. We do advocacy for

23:40.560 --&gt; 23:49.680
digital civil rights over and over again, by cross-finding based on donations. And this is

23:49.680 --&gt; 23:56.320
something that is problematic because there are few, very few advocates in the political field

23:56.320 --&gt; 24:01.840
that strive towards the same goals and support them. So we really need to support

24:02.880 --&gt; 24:08.480
these digital civil society organizations to do advocacy in a better way in a more meaningful way.

24:11.040 --&gt; 24:19.520
Okay, can you just quickly before you say, what ideas do you have, how to better support

24:19.520 --&gt; 24:24.480
those civil society organizations? Because I mean, I think we all agree, especially from

24:24.480 --&gt; 24:29.120
efforts of East Side, who also would like to have more donations to support this work. We are

24:29.120 --&gt; 24:35.600
doing there and also partly doing with employees who can then follow up there and explain politicians

24:35.600 --&gt; 24:41.920
by is it important that that such an app is free software? Why is it a problem that the frameworks

24:41.920 --&gt; 24:47.440
which those apps are using like on the Apple side and the Android side that those frameworks

24:47.440 --&gt; 24:52.400
are still proprietary? So that there's a lot of work you have to do there, a lot of groundwork

24:52.400 --&gt; 24:58.560
explaining basic things about technology. And there are other organizations also doing this. So

24:58.560 --&gt; 25:02.400
what can be done there that there is a better way on supporting those?

25:02.880 --&gt; 25:10.720
I believe that one solution would be to get the entire discussion about digital technologies

25:10.720 --&gt; 25:17.360
and software away from this innovation narrative that is always about new products, about

25:18.640 --&gt; 25:23.280
cutting edge, new technologies, about whatever artificial intelligence and blockchain. I mean,

25:23.280 --&gt; 25:28.640
you all know that this is something that the political discourse is very much about. Instead,

25:28.640 --&gt; 25:37.280
we need to talk about basic digital services that need to be rolled out and how we can make them

25:37.280 --&gt; 25:44.640
possible. And this could be done, for example, through a foundation under public law. There are

25:44.640 --&gt; 25:51.760
examples in other countries that have realized that already and put that into action that is equipped

25:51.760 --&gt; 26:00.400
with public money, but does not necessarily have to run exactly along the lines of public

26:00.400 --&gt; 26:07.120
procurement. It can be a little more risk-happy if that's what you're making use here,

26:07.920 --&gt; 26:12.960
with a mission of promoting the development maintenance and also the provision of digital

26:12.960 --&gt; 26:19.200
technologies for society, so not for profit, which is something that public investment mostly

26:19.200 --&gt; 26:26.480
focuses on, but really for the public interest. Do you have other examples from other countries there

26:26.480 --&gt; 26:34.080
where they are doing this well, this part, about not just focusing on bus routes, which people

26:34.080 --&gt; 26:39.760
have to include to get funding and not just getting funding for new innovative stuff, but doing

26:39.760 --&gt; 26:45.600
also this groundwork, this maintenance, and also the parts which you mentioned, which are not

26:45.600 --&gt; 26:53.360
just about coding in free software, but general explanation of free software, and the community

26:53.360 --&gt; 27:01.760
management in projects, and the explanation to people how to use technology there. Are there

27:01.760 --&gt; 27:09.200
other good examples you know from other countries in Europe? Those were a lot of aspects, and I

27:09.280 --&gt; 27:16.720
think no country in the world checks all of these boxes. I think that the countries that actually

27:16.720 --&gt; 27:21.200
have a digital service unit that is attached to the government, but kind of

27:22.720 --&gt; 27:28.400
gathers all the different ideas of the different ministries and government bodies about digital

27:28.400 --&gt; 27:36.480
technology and software, and informs them and kind of manages the different endeavors and

27:36.560 --&gt; 27:42.400
points them all towards one direction, for example, free software, and that is something that would

27:42.400 --&gt; 27:47.600
already help. In Germany we have this situation that there are three or four. I lost count to be

27:47.600 --&gt; 27:51.920
honest. Ministries are claimed to be the digital ministry, which is basically ridiculous.

27:53.680 --&gt; 28:01.520
And one country that really does a good job in building e-government software and also civic

28:01.600 --&gt; 28:08.240
tech applications, applications that enable people to take part in the political debate,

28:09.120 --&gt; 28:17.520
would be Taiwan. Taiwan also has a fantastic digital minister, Audrey Tang, and this digital

28:17.520 --&gt; 28:25.920
ministry does a really good job at testing new modes of digital participation, digital representation

28:26.000 --&gt; 28:33.440
of the citizens, and all that code is released under a public license. So that is one thing that is

28:33.440 --&gt; 28:38.320
yeah, that is clear for them that this technology needs to be free software.

28:41.360 --&gt; 28:42.240
Okay, thank you.

28:42.240 --&gt; 28:55.360
So the third claim I think I don't need to explain it further because this is a very successful

28:55.360 --&gt; 29:01.680
campaign by the Free Software Foundation Europe. It is public money, public code. We added to it

29:01.680 --&gt; 29:10.320
public money, public good, because this is the idea of these recommendations that everything

29:10.320 --&gt; 29:17.200
about technology needs to be turned towards being an investment for the public good and not

29:17.200 --&gt; 29:26.160
for private companies interest. And the fourth recommendation was the development of a public

29:26.160 --&gt; 29:34.160
digital infrastructure. We all know that very much of our digital infrastructure is privatized,

29:34.880 --&gt; 29:42.720
and this brings along many problems, social inequality, also the investment that public

29:42.720 --&gt; 29:52.160
bodies do put into the digital sector, then in the end only benefit private companies. We need

29:52.160 --&gt; 30:01.120
to understand that digital infrastructure is no different than roads, and we need a public

30:01.120 --&gt; 30:08.080
road network to get to work or to transport goods from one place to another. And we also need

30:08.080 --&gt; 30:13.040
a digital infrastructure that is public and that allows us to communicate under a set of rules

30:13.040 --&gt; 30:23.760
that is not made up by private companies. So it's a call for pop up bicycle lanes on those

30:23.840 --&gt; 30:30.240
public infrastructures so that we don't forget the individuals. Exactly.

30:31.840 --&gt; 30:40.400
Okay. Then yeah, I think from my side, the main question for those claims is what are the next

30:40.400 --&gt; 30:47.040
steps now? So you formulated those. Other organizations signed it. The FSFE was also amongst the

30:47.040 --&gt; 30:54.240
first organizations who signed those claims. What are the next steps now? Do you need more

30:54.240 --&gt; 30:59.440
organizations joining and what are the next things we have on your road map there?

31:02.240 --&gt; 31:09.040
Well, we would have thought that with almost 80 organizations from Germany but also from Switzerland

31:09.040 --&gt; 31:15.280
from Austria, we would have thought that it would have some impact and lead to some sort of

31:15.280 --&gt; 31:24.400
discussion and it was it was sad to see that it didn't. I believe that we need to get more involved

31:24.400 --&gt; 31:31.040
into the policy processes, into the political debates actively and we need to get ourselves

31:31.040 --&gt; 31:38.080
in there and to the table to put down these points again and again until people, especially

31:38.080 --&gt; 31:45.040
political decision makers, can't ignore them anymore. So what we try to do now is with the

31:45.040 --&gt; 31:52.240
upcoming German federal election next year to bring this to a state level and for this we are now

31:52.240 --&gt; 31:58.960
have also a mailing list, quite revolutionary, where people can join. So I think instead of

31:58.960 --&gt; 32:04.640
signing these recommendations, which of course organizations can do, I invite them to join

32:04.640 --&gt; 32:09.840
the mailing list and join that discussion actively and see how we can join forces in order to

32:10.800 --&gt; 32:15.360
influence the public discourse about technology in a way that is more in all of our interest.

32:16.320 --&gt; 32:22.880
And I mean those claims were at the moment focusing on Germany, but then they are also now all

32:22.880 --&gt; 32:28.880
translated into English and the discussion on the mailing list is that something Germany specific

32:28.880 --&gt; 32:33.120
or is that something which you would like people from all around Europe to join you there?

32:34.080 --&gt; 32:41.840
That is a good question. I think right now it is a growing discussion. I would love to have

32:41.840 --&gt; 32:48.160
an exchange with people all over Europe because I think the struggles are the same in each of the

32:48.160 --&gt; 32:56.320
countries and people in other countries might have tested out things and have experiences that we

32:56.320 --&gt; 33:01.600
could absolutely learn from that would be very valuable for us. And then again, of course we are

33:01.600 --&gt; 33:07.440
also happy to share our ideas and our approaches. So I would invite everyone to join if they don't

33:07.440 --&gt; 33:12.640
mind that one of the other email might be written in German, but then again, I think we have good

33:12.640 --&gt; 33:20.880
translation services for those. So far on civil societies can support those for claims on your

33:20.880 --&gt; 33:27.600
website. Is there also a way for individuals apart from the mailing list to join in and to support you?

33:28.400 --&gt; 33:42.640
The decision for limiting the signing for organizations was a technical one we didn't want to

33:43.360 --&gt; 33:52.960
put people's names on a public website because you might be faced with take down requests

33:52.960 --&gt; 33:57.440
in a couple of years and that would result in a lot of work for us. We're doing this now

33:57.440 --&gt; 34:03.680
free time and of course we don't want to have data out there public if people don't like it,

34:03.680 --&gt; 34:07.840
but then again, there was also a lot of work to manage that for years and years to come. That's

34:07.840 --&gt; 34:15.600
basically why we decided to limit the list to organizations. So this was not meant to shrug off

34:15.600 --&gt; 34:21.280
individuals and know the important work that they do. If they want to support is yes, do join

34:21.360 --&gt; 34:28.800
the mailing list and let us know your ideas. The discussion is really definitely open to individuals as

34:28.800 --&gt; 34:37.600
well. Thank you Alisa for all the answers. In regard to the time, I would now go to our last

34:37.600 --&gt; 34:45.520
question. This one is last but not least and it's a question we usually ask everybody on the end

34:45.520 --&gt; 34:52.800
of our podcast. Every year on the 14th of February, you know that we set a bright Valentine's Day

34:52.800 --&gt; 34:59.280
but the FSFE organizes also the I love free software day and the I love free software day is a

34:59.280 --&gt; 35:06.480
chance to thank contributors for their work for free software and at the FSFE, we also believe that

35:06.480 --&gt; 35:12.000
we should not only thank contributors once a year because as you already said, it's really important

35:12.160 --&gt; 35:18.160
to say thank you and to be open and to be welcoming. So we would like to give you the chance to

35:18.160 --&gt; 35:23.760
thank someone. All right. I want to thank a huge group of people and I'm not sure I know anyone

35:23.760 --&gt; 35:31.040
of those people personally but I wanted to know that I and many many others use what you build

35:31.040 --&gt; 35:37.040
on a daily basis on an hourly basis. I know that you know this but maybe it's nice to have that

35:37.200 --&gt; 35:43.200
side out loud. I really appreciate the Linux kernel because it makes my computer tick and it makes

35:43.200 --&gt; 35:48.960
me able to do what I do. It wouldn't be possible without you folks and I really appreciate you.

35:51.440 --&gt; 35:58.160
Thank you Alisa and from my side before we finish up, thank you very much for all the work you

35:58.160 --&gt; 36:05.760
are doing there for many many years now. I know it can sometimes feel like there isn't that much

36:05.760 --&gt; 36:12.320
change. Why are all those ministries fighting with each other? Why can't they agree and get some

36:12.320 --&gt; 36:19.440
steps forward there? Thank you very much for continuously reminding people about free software

36:19.440 --&gt; 36:29.120
and other topics about free society in a digital area for your work with the prototype fund you

36:29.120 --&gt; 36:37.440
have done before and your work on researching how free software contributors can better be supported.

36:37.440 --&gt; 36:41.280
So thank you very much about that and please keep up your good work there.

36:42.880 --&gt; 36:46.240
Thank you all and thank you all for listening. I have a lovely day.
