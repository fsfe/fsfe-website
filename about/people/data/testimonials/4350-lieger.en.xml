      I'm interested in values, politics, society; in new forms of production,
      based on free co-operation in egalitarian structures; in knowledge
      commons and collective intelligence. That's why I'm here and why I wish
      to support the free software movement. I have no technical background,
      and neither do most of the people I know.
