    <title>160,000 Euro short for 2014</title>
    <body>
      <p>As a reader of our website, you are aware of the
    importance of Free Software for a free society. The FSFE has been fighting
    for Free Software since 2001. Since then, <a href="/about/timeline.html">we have made a big difference</a> by
  exercising political pressure, helping Free Software developers with legal
  expertise, and building public awareness for software freedom. To continue
  this important work, we need a total budget of 390,000 Euro for 2014. We are
  currently still 160,000 short of this goal.</p>
