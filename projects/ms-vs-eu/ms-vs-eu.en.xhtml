<h1>Microsoft against free competition </h1>
</center>

<p> In 2001 the European Union, through the DG Competition of the
European Commission (lead by prof. Monti), started investigating on
Microsoft dominant position in the desktop operating systems.  The
Free Software Foundation Europe was invited from the EC to represent
the stances of Free Software movement.  In 2004 FSFE is trying to
participate to the appeal to defend again free competition and freedom
of choice against abuses.</p>

<p>FSF Europe decided to contribute to the investigations of DG
Competition due to our long and broad experience in the software
field.  Also Free Software, and in particular the GNU/Linux operating
system, was cited by Microsoft as its principal competitor, therefore
FSF Europe had a direct interest in defending it.  In a <a
href="application-1.0.pdf">letter FIXME: I CANNOT COMPILE THE TEX
FILE</a> to the DG Competition dated 16 November 2001, FSFE asked to
be heared.</p>

<p>The request was accepted and therefore the team members and legals
of FSF Europe had access to the confidential information and had the
chance to comment on the advancement of the investigation.</p>

<p>In August 2003, FSF Europe asked the Commission to hear the
suggestions of the Samba Team to bring back competition in the
file/print server market.  The <a
href="monti-samba-submission.pdf">document FIXME AGAIN</a>, signed by
Jeremy Allison, project leader of Free Software Project Samba, was
very well received.  In a private hearing in November 2003, Peter
Gerwinsky and Jeremy Allison exposed the positions of <a
href="hearing-2.0.pdf">FSF Europe</a> and of the Samba Team officially
in front of the Commission.</p>

<p>The <a href="CEC-C-2004-900-final.pdf">Final Decision</a> of the DG
Competition takes into consideration most of the comments made by FSF
Europe to defend Free Software (although it is not a perfect
solution.)</p>

<p>In June 2004 Microsoft appealed against the sentence.  FSF Europe
is worried that the loopholes in the Decision can be exploited by
Microsoft's lawyers and is therefore participating to the appeal as
third party FIXME: IS THAT THE PROPER NAME?.</p>

<p>EXPLAIN LOOPHOLES: mainly I would add a note about the RAND
licenses.</p>
