      <h1>TUX&amp;GNU@school - 2nd edition</h1>

      <p><i>Every month the column TUX&amp;GNU@school reports about
      free education software, a homepage on the topic and an easy
      to implement idea. This month I talk about <a
      href="http://www.ofset.org/gcompris">GCompris</a>, a GNU
      education program for the young and the old, about <a
      href="http://www.pingos.schulnetz.org">PingoS.schulnetz.org</a>,
      a homepage for GNU/Linux support at german schools and about
      the idea "Text4mator - text modification made easy".</i></p>

      <p>Welcome to the second edition of TUX&amp;GNU@school [18].
      At the beginning I want to thank all the people who sent me
      tips for education software I could report about. At this
      place it would be good to explain this column's name: TUX is
      the name of the meanwhile well-known mascot of Linux, a
      little dinky penguin. But GNU [2] on the one hand stands for
      the recursive acronym "GNU is not UNIX", which is the name of
      a project that's developing a free version of UNIX and on the
      other hand it stands for the animal species of the mascot of
      GNU. Finally the "@school" means "in or at school". But now
      we're going on to the first item.</p>

      <h3>GCompris - free education software for the young and the
      old</h3>

      <p>GCompris [3] is a free education program that has become
      official GNU software in the meantime. Actually it's more a
      uniform interface for different learning boards. I tested the
      version 1.0.5 under Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (testing) and KDE
      2.2.</p>

      <p>When you start the program, the main window of screenshot
      1 appears. This window is split in three sections with the
      single learning boards at the top, a short description in the
      middle and a short menu panel at the bottom. Up to now there
      are at the head four links that are guiding to another boards
      and under it, in the second row, there are four boards
      guiding to the following boards: With the first one, the kid
      can learn the clock or time, the second link goes to a simple
      vector painting programm, at the third board you have to set
      the watergates that way TUX with his ship can go trough and
      eventually the child learns with the fourth board, where the
      different countries are situated in North and South America.
      The pictures at the head of the main window are indicated by
      different symbols. The small yellow arrow tells the link is
      going to additional teaching boards, whereas the little
      stars, at the pictures which are boards themselves, show the
      level. At teaching boards with an integrated sound output the
      loudspeaker symbol tells you, if sound output is possible or
      not, like it's the case in screenshot 1. You can always read
      a short description and the name of the author in the middle
      part of the main window. And eventually at the bottom there
      are four symbols which, from left to right, go to more
      information about GCompris, open the configuration menu, show
      the helping documentation and with a click on the last
      picture closes the program. At the configuration menu you can
      make settings like the language you prefer or if GCompris has
      his own window or it starts in fullscreen mode. Regarding the
      language settings, you should adapt the environment variable
      LANG to match your language. If not, you can change it e.g.
      for english by writing the following command on a console:
      <tt>export LANG=en_EN</tt>.</p>

      </p>

      <h5>Screenshot 1: GCompris in action</h5>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p>With the board for learning the time, I want to show how
      the single subprograms are built. As you can see in
      screenshot 2, there is a menu at the bottom too, which
      contains little pictures. By clicking on the picture
      rightmost you go back to the main window. By the other two
      the picture with the die shows you the current level und by
      clicking on it you climb one level. If you are content with
      your settings, push the hand with thumb up or alternatively
      you can push RETURN and the computer checks the correctness
      of the settings. If the answer was correct you see either a
      happily clown face or a flower with a laughing mouth and you
      can even hear it with activated sound output; if the result
      was wrong, the clown and the flower are sad and you can try
      it again. The problem you have to solve in this board is to
      set the watch as the text at the left says. The watch hands
      can be moved and set with the mouse. In higher levels even
      the hour watch hand are set to the time given by the minute
      hand watch. At the right you can see in which of how many
      levels you are, shown by to numbers.</p>

      </p>

      <h5>Screenshot 2: Learning the time with GCompris</h5>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p>As already said at the beginning GCompris is supposed to
      be "only" a common interface for different teaching boards.
      The developer encourages everyone to build own boards as
      descriped shortly in the documentation. Personally I like
      this program very much because it is interesting for every
      age with his different subprograms. Up to now GCompris was
      translated into German, English, French and Spanish whereas
      they work on an Italian translation and for the near future
      we can expect a Hungarian one. What I still miss is a
      evaluation or something like highscores but I think that we
      won't wait as long for these features because the development
      of GCompris is going very quickly. Therefore a great thank
      you for Bruno Coudoin and all the other authors of GCompris
      too and a lot of success for the future.</p>

      <p><i>Addendum: As I saw right now on the mailing list of the
      project, they released GCompris 1.1.0. The first edition with
      editor functions and a Hungarian translation.</i></p>

      <p>But now to the home of the PingoS.</p>

      <h3>Pingos.schulnetz.org - free support for free schools</h3>

      <p><i>Attention: This site is available in German only
      !!!</i></p>

      <p>Under the URL above you find in the first place the head
      quarter [4] (see screenshot 2) of the German PingoS. That's a
      project which wants to find and coordinate volunteers in (at
      the moment) Germany for GNU/Linux support at schools. They
      try this with the help of different online media. Willing and
      interested GNU/Linux appreciators can sign in the online form
      [5] which asks for state of knowledge and residence too. All
      data exclusive the name, the email address and the residence
      are used only internally, the others are entered in the
      PingoS-helper-card (see screenshot 4). Schools in Germany
      searching help for imminent project or that only have
      questions on topic can search on the helper-card [6] and
      click on the nearest town for a list of helpers in that area.
      If you only have questions sometimes it's surely not a bad
      idea to subscribe on the mailing list [7] of the preject.
      There are always able and rapid answers on the main list [8].
      If think about larger projects or questions, they distribute
      the responsibility for it on one of the mailing lists. The
      work is mostly documented with a short description on the
      project website [9]. For the future interesting is surely the
      corporation with groups of Austria or the "ALIS -
      Arbeitsgruppe Linux an Schulen" [10] (Swiss work group for
      Linux at school) of Switzerland. Particularly you can even
      hear about requests from Great Britain for building up
      something similar.</p>

      <p><img src="./img/pingos.en.png"
      alt="Screenshot 3: Front page of the PingoS homepage"
      width="800" height="600" border="0" /><br />
      </p>

      <h5>Screenshot 3: Front page of the Pingos homepage</h5>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p>But the support project isn't the only that's at home on
      the homepage of the PingoS. Not forgetting the section with
      the self-developed software [11] of the PingoS, e.g.
      education or administration software. One of the most famous
      projects surely is the "Tipptrainer" [12], another program
      for learning typing, but more about it at another time.
      Furthermore you can find there a lot of small scripts [13],
      Perl or Bash, which ease the day for us. A last section of
      the website I want to talk about is the area with the
      documentation and the schooling brochures [14]. There you can
      find almost everything from Python introductions to medium
      large GNU/Linux courses.</p>

      <p><img src="./img/pingos-karte.jpg"
      alt="Screenshot 4: PingoS helper card" width="492"
      height="647" border="0" /><br />
      </p>

      <h5>Screenshot 4: PingoS helper card</h5>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p>At the end I still want to tell about a very interesting
      project of the PingoS: SelfLinux [15]. With SelfLinux the
      PingoS want to create a complete reference to GNU/Linux for
      novices. Therefor they collect written descriptions and
      articles about tasks and problems around the free operating
      system and the application software and compose them
      structured. Until now there is already a lot of knowledge and
      texts but they still need writer for another texts. At [16]
      you can explore the work made up to now. From my side good
      speed for the future and may you receive a "thank you" from
      time to time.</p>

      <p>That's it about the PingoS, let's proceed to a new idea
      for an easy to implement software.</p>

      <h3>Text4mator - text modification made easy</h3>

      <p>Before I talk about the idea of this month, I still want
      to write something about the last one and what resulted of
      it. In the first three or four months after the publication
      of the first edition it seemed as if nobody had time to
      implement the idea. Therefor and because I had to learn
      programming for my studies I tried it myself. I wrote a not
      yet satisfying program in C++ that generates random numbers
      through a bash script that the program writes to a file with
      LaTeX formatting. The two commands <tt>latex</tt> and
      <tt>dvips</tt> transform this file into an Postscript file
      which is printed by <tt>lpr</tt>. I'll release the program
      and a short description in a few days on [10] under the terms
      of the GNU GPL. At this point still a thank you to Diego
      Kuonen for his help with the LaTeX syntax. Then before
      approximately one and a half month I received an email form
      Franziska Meyer that she implemented the idea too. But she
      made it by far more interesting. Because she was already
      familiarising herself with PHP at that time, she had the idea
      to implement it as a web service (I want to use this new word
      once too ;-). Thought and done and like this it is possible
      today going on her website [17] to generate a worksheet which
      is downloadable as a pdf-file for the quarter of an hour. An
      ingenious idea as I think; because like this you don't even
      have to install a separate program. When I asked her to
      release the source code to install it perhaps in an Intranet
      she said: "Ok, ich überleg's mir mal - und schaue den Code
      durch, ob ich den wirklich freigeben kann ;-)" (Ok, I think
      about it - and will go through the code whether I can really
      release that ;-)). Here too a great thank you to ZIS for her
      effort.</p>

      <p>But now up to the actually idea I want to introduce this
      time. If you learn the verbosity at school you're doing it
      right often with worksheets with upper-case texts. In the
      other case you use for the introduction of punctuation marks
      often texts without periods, commas, questions marks, etc.
      The teachers make this all in toilsome handwork. On the other
      case it would be right easy for good script writers and
      programmers to implement a solution. There were again
      different variations and possibilities, e.g. to write all
      words upper- or lower-case, to write only the first letter
      lower- or upper-case, etc. Furthermore you have to pay
      attention to leave always the same space between the single
      words. I hope somebody of you is having a good mind and I can
      report about it next time.</p>

      <p>Ok, that's the end for this time. At the end I let you
      know that my (spontaneous) conceptions for easy to implement
      ideas are becoming quite rare. I hope so that you can help in
      this case and will send some to me [1] I can tell about. The
      next time is already in two weeks because this edition came
      too late and I don't want to begin with delays. Bye up to the
      next time when we're on it again ...</p>
