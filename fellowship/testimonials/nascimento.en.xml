            Freedom is one of the core values of our Society and one of the basic 
            concepts of Democracy. Supporting and spreading Free Software is one 
            way to build creative alternatives for social inclusion and to protect 
            our citizens from the digital exploitation. We are responsible to build 
            a better World as a gift for our future generations.
