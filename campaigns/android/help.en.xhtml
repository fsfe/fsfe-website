          Help us encourage people to liberate their device and convince app
          developers to release only free software. We need you to coordinate

	  <h2 id="FreeingApps">Freeing Non-Free Apps</h2>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, there are still some applications that do not have a free
        alternative. To use the proprietary app is a bad idea; it takes away
        your freedom. In addition, if you settle into using the non-free
        program, you won't feel the need for it to be free. Even if you don't
        know how to program, you can <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/ConvinceYourFriends">contact</a> the authors
        of crucial apps and <a href="https://fsfe.pad.foebud.org/en-android">ask
        them politely</a> for their reasons for not publishing their app as Free
        Software. Many apps are available without payments, so money is not
        always the dominating reason. Sometimes one email can make a difference
        and there have already been successful attempts: <a
        href="https://market.android.com/details?id=cz.hejl.chesswalk">Chess
        Walk</a> for example is now <a
        href="https://gitorious.org/chesswalk/chesswalk">liberated</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Apps That Still Need To Be Liberated</h3>

      <p>
        We collect apps that have no free counterpart, but are important to have
        on a free system <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Android#Apps_That_Still_Need_To_Be_Liberated">in
        our wiki</a>. Please add other essential apps there. People can <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/ConvinceYourFriends">contact the authors</a>
        of those apps and ask them why they are not Free Software.
      </p>

      <h3>Responses to Objections We've Heard from App Developers</h3>

      <p>
        Only when we understand the motivation of programmers who keep their
        apps proprietary, we know what needs to be changed in order to change
        their minds and to convince them of liberating their own app. Please <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Android#Responses_to_Objections_We.27ve_Heard_from_App_Developers">contribute
        your experiences</a> with developers of non-free apps here and <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Android#Responses_to_Objections_We.27ve_Heard_from_App_Developers">share
        useful responses</a> to their objections.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Objection:</strong> If I publish my app as Free Software, I
          will not be able to make money with it. 
          <ul> 
            <li> You can still offer your app in other markets and ask for money
            there. </li> 
            <li> Offer options for people to donate. Free markets
            like F-Droid can include them and their users like to reward.
            Depending on your case, you might make more money with donations
            than from sales. </li> 
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Objection:</strong> But when my app is Free Software other
          people can distribute it without me getting profit. 
          <ul> 
            <li> That is true, but keep in mind that people who don't want to
            pay you will always find ways to do so. </li> 
            <li> If you ask people
            in a friendly non-obtrusive way and give them good reasons, they
            will give you money. </li> 
            <li> In case other people distribute your
            app without charge over markets, there are ways to stop that.
            Talking to the distributor or the market operator is one way. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Objection:</strong> I'm embarrassed by my bad code and don't
          want anybody to see it (from <a
          href="http://blog.flattr4android.com/?p=52">Flattr4Android</a>). 
          <ul>
            <li> Your code is very useful to many people and it works. Of course
            good code would be better, but code quality is secondary to freedom.
            </li> 
            <li> Everybody wrote bad code at some point. Sharing it will
            enable others to help you improving it. </li> 
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
     
      <h2 id="Contact">Contact and Contributing</h2>
      
      <p>
        If you want to stay informed or like to work with others on a free
        Android system, you can <strong><a
        href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/android">subscribe to the
        mailing-list</a></strong>. You can also ask questions or give input by
        writing to <a
        href="mailto:android&#64;lists.fsfe.org">android&#64;lists.fsfe.org</a>.
        For technical questions about apps, the <a
        href="irc://irc.freenode.net/fdroid">F-Droid IRC channel</a> is a good
        place to ask. For exchange about the lower layers of Android, the <a
        href="irc://irc.freenode.net/cyanogenmod">CyanogenMod IRC channel</a> is
        more suitable. Everybody in this community is very friendly and loves
        others to help, so don't be shy and get involved!
      </p>

      <h2>Other Related Initiatives</h2>

      <p>
        Even though this campaign is about Android, there are other important
        initiatives that also have the goal to allow you using small mobile
        computers in freedom. There is the spiritual Openmoko continuation <a
        href="http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-main/">GTA04 from Golden
        Delicious</a>. It builds a free phone without the need for proprietary
        drivers. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maemo">Maemo</a>/<a
        href="https://meego.com/">MeeGo</a> initiative has now moved into <a
        href="http://merproject.org/">Mer</a> and <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen">Tizen</a> and tries to be an
        alternative free operating system. Also WebOS is <a
        href="http://developer.palm.com/blog/2011/12/open-source/">about to be
        liberated</a>.
