<h3>Administrative Support</h3>

<p>We can help <a href="contact.html">answer questions</a> about Free Software license adoption or use. Our services in this area range from describing the type of formal structures that can make using code easier through to assisting with community relations or resolving issues with incompliant code.  We can also help you find legal and technical experts to provide specialised services when necessary.</p>

<h3>Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA)</h3>

<p>We make a specialised copyright assignment document called the <a href="fla.html">Fiduciary License Agreement</a> available to the community at large.  The FLA allows one entity to safeguard all of the code created for a project by consolidating copyright (or exclusive exploitation rights).  We can assist projects or business adapt and adopt it for their own use.</p>
</div>

<h3>Fiduciary Programme</h3>

<p>We also use the FLA for our own <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/projects/ftf/fiduciary.en.html">Fiduciary Programme</a>.  This allows projects to assign copyright to FSFE, and FSFE then deals with any legal issues that occur for that project.  This frees up developers to focus on coding great new solutions.</p>
