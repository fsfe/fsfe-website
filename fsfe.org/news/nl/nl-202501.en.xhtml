<h3 id="quote-of-the-month">Quote of the
Month</h3>
<p>“I have a huge list of advice I would give people participating in
Youth Hacking 4 Freedom, but there is one that I would highlight: don't
be afraid to submit unfinished projects! Thankfully my mother encouraged
me to submit it and my life has completely changed for the better ever
since!”</p>
<p> - Sofía Aritz, 2024 YH4F winner </p>


<h3 id="2024-predictions">T minus
23 years until 2048</h3>
<p>“What will happen in the movement for software freedom in 2025? It is
hard for me to make such predictions. What the past 20 years working for
the Free Software Foundation Europe have taught me is to be prepared for
the things you cannot predict. While predicting the future is always	
hard, <a href="/news/2025/news-20250103-01.html">we
know what we are aiming to accomplish in the long run</a>."</p>

<h3 id="fosdem">Ready for FOSDEM? Join our “Legal &amp; Policy
issues” and “Funding the FOSS Ecosystem” devrooms</h3>
<p>FOSDEM 2025 is around the corner and its schedule is out! This year
the FSFE is co-organizing two devrooms: “Legal &amp; Policy issues” and
“Funding the FOSS Ecosystem”.</p>
<p>For the fifth consecutive year, the FSFE,
together with our co-hosts, is proud to organize the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/legal-and-policy/">Legal
and Policy Issues devroom</a>, a popular track focused on the political
and legal challenges in the realm of software freedom.This devroom is now in its 13th edition. </p>
<p>This year, we are also contributing to the
organization of the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/funding/"><em>Funding the
FOSS Ecosystem</em></a> devroom. Debuting at this FOSDEM edition, this 
track aims to bring together developers, maintainers, policymakers,
entrepreneurs, donors, and funders to explore sustainable funding models
and mechanisms that ensure the longevity and security of FOSS
projects.</p>

<h3 id="apple-litigation">The FSFE demands that Apple provide broader interoperability</h3>
<p>In parallel to <a href="/activities/apple-litigation/apple-litigation.html">the litigation efforts against Apple</a>, the FSFE
continues to collaborate with the European Commission and other stakeholders in
the implementation of the DMA. The FSFE is participating in a comprehensive study
on how Apple's interoperability policies negatively affect Free
Software. The study has been accepted by a <a href="https://kgi.georgetown.edu/events/dma-and-beyond-conference/">conference to be held
in Washington DC</a> organised by the renowned Knight-Georgetown
Institute and Yale University. </p>
<p>Besides, the FSFE is working together other civil
society organisations to submit a position for the Commission's public
<a href="http://[https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/dma100204-consultation-proposed-measures-requesting-interoperability-apples-ios-and-ipados-operating_en">consultation
on Apple's compliance measures regarding interoperability required by the
DMA</a>.</p>


<h3 id="yh4f">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom:
2025 edition and interviews with 2024 participants </h3>
<p>The new edition of YH4F has officially begun, marking the start of
its programming period earlier this month. As we eagerly await the
exciting projects this fourth edition will unveil, we talked with three
participants from the last edition: <a href="/news/2024/news-20241211-01.html">Vinícius,
Simon</a>, and <a href="/news/2025/news-20250107-01.html">Sofia, who was one of the 2024 winners</a>.</p>
<p>On 9 January the competition kicked off with its opening event in which 
participants got information about the contest and their questions were 
answered, while learning some tips from former winners.</p>

<h3 id="38c3">The FSFE at 38C3</h3>
<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe, along with over
sixteen thousand attendees, <a href="/news/2025/news-20250110-01.html">took part in the 38th Chaos Communication
Congress with a booth, several talks, and a lot of stickers</a>. It was a
great pleasure to join, once again, the Chaos family for another
impressive four-day congress. Thank you all for coming!
</p>

<h3 id="zooom">The FSFE promotes freedom of software, hardware,
and data</h3>
<p>The ZOOOM (3Os) Initiative promotes innovation based on freedom of
software, hardware, and data. With its recent conclusion, the FSFE hopes
to inspire broader use and effective application of Free Software by
business, academia, and the public sector.</p>

<p>
In only two years, the ZOOOM project produced comprehensive research 
merging aspects of Free Software, Open Data and Open Hardware. Focusing 
on the importance of these assets for the future of AI, the initiative 
not only produced scientific materials tackling legal and business 
issues regarding Free Software, but also developed a series of 
recommendations.

<h3 id="sfp">SFP#27: Policy and EU:
Free Software hearing in the German Bundestag</h3>
<p>At the beginning of December, the FSFE participated in a <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/hSU9mKZBU1CmR1izg7RBvu">German parliament
hearing on Free Software</a>, organised by the Digital Committee. The
hearing focused on the use of Free Software for public
administration. In <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/cMMF6DCiLB9RncdL46KCNb">his speech for

importance of funding for Free Software and the current trend of 
'openwashing' and how this can affect the procurement process in public administration.</p>
