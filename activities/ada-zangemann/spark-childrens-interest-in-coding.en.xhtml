  <h1 class="p-name">Let's spark children's interest in coding</h1>

  <p>The FSFE has created the illustrated book "Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of
  Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream" as an Open Education Resource
  under a Creative Commons License, the same one that Wikipedia has. The story
  is about the inventor Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer.  Ada
  begins to experiment with hardware and software, and in the process realises
  how crucial technology is for her and others. It is a fascinating story for
  children from 6 years, motivating them, especially girls, to tinker with
  hardware and software and encouraging them to shape their own technology.</p>

  <h2>Readings, discussions, workshops: Inspire children around the world</h2>

  <p>Our volunteers, staff, and the author of the book have done many readings
  in different languages throughout the world, spreading Ada's story to over
  1000 children. Many of them, especially girls, have told us that the story
  encourages them to start inventing and programming.</p>

  <p>For the events we have collaborated with schools, libraries, municipalities,
  organisations that introduce children into programming, and organisation
  working with refugee children.</p>

  <h2>Make the story accessible for all</h2>

  <p>We would like to make the materials accessible for everyone. Thanks to
  donations, the FSFE was able to release Arabic and Ukrainian translations of
  the book. A French translation and publication was coordinated by the French
  Ministry of National Education, and a car company commissioned a Spanish
  translation. Volunteers translated the book into Valencian, Danish, Hindi,
  Italian, and are working on other languages.</p>

  <p>We are also working with organisations and publishers on accessible eBook
  versions for people who read differently due to conditions such as blindness
  or low vision.</p>

  <h2>Reach more children with a movie</h2>

  <p>To reach more children, we will create a animated video version of the
  book produced by an experienced 2D animation studio, also published as an
  Open Educational Resource. Everyone will be able free to download and share
  the video, put it on their or the schools computers, ship it with other
  education material, embed it on company's and organisation's websites, or
  display the video at events.</p>

  <p>To reach more children, we want to create an animated "Ada &amp; Zangemann"
  movie. The 30-minute film will be produced by an experienced 2D animation
  studio, and we will also release it as an Open Educational Resource. Anyone
  will be able to download and share the movie, embed it on websites, use it in
  schools, display it at events, and integrate it with other educational
  material, making a difference to the quality of IT education that is so vital
  for young people in our digital society.</p>

  <p><strong>To make this happen, we need your support!</strong> To produce the
  movie in 2024 in English, French, German, and Italian will cost us €40,000.
  For 2025 we aim to get €80,000 in donations for organising readings,
  preparing materials, distributing books to libraries, and creating additional
  translations of the book and video.</p>

  <p>If you decide to donate <strong>€3600</strong> or more, please let us know
  if we can mention you in the film credits with your logo. The size of the
  logo will depend on the amount (more than €3,600, €7,200,
  €14,000, to €32,000)</p>
