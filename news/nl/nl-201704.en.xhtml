    <h1 class="p-name">FSFE Newsletter - April 2017</h1>

    <h2 id="Free-Software-in-the-German-OGP-action-plan">Free Software in the German OGP action plan</h2>

    <p>Last December, Germany joined the 
    <a href="https://www.opengovpartnership.org/">Open Government 
    Partnership</a> and now has until June 2017 to develop and decide
    on an action plan. Increased transparency and continuous reporting, 
    governmental effectiveness and citizen-friendly administration are
    all part of the goals of Open Government.</p>

    <p>The FSFE has worked together with other organisations and the 
    "working group OGP" Germany to summarise the topic of Free Software
     in the Open Government context and provide concrete action items,
     along with a short but illuminating introduction into the topic
     and a vision for 2030. The recommendations were submitted to the
     German government in March.</p>

    <p>The proposal was the outcome of a workshop, held by the German
     Government in February, with the contribution of numerous
     civil society representatives, including the FSFE. By 
     <a href="/news/2017/news-20170328-01.html">
	 publishing our suggestions</a>, we hope to enable civil society 
	 actors worldwide to learn about the OGP discussion in Germany and
	 use these suggestions in other countries.</p>

	  Freedomvote.nl</a>, initiated by the Dutch FSFE group, compared
	  party positions on digital freedom and not only helped voters
	  to make up their minds, but also gave a taste of what to expect
	  by the newly elected parties' digital policies.</li>

      <li> Last month, <a href="/associates/associates.html">
	  we welcomed as an associated organisation, Dyne.org - a
