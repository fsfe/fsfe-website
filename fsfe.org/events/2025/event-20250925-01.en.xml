      <p>We are a group for women* who are interested in Free Software. Once a month we meet to talk about Free Software and women* in the tech. Together we learn about Free Software and related topics that we care about and discuss recent developments.</p>
     <p>The group is women-centric and open to all women*, inter, trans and non-binary people.</p>
     <p>This call will be an open conversation. Perhaps a good opportunity for new people to just say Hi, or bring up topics that are on your mind.</p>
