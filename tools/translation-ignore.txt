# This file defines the filenames that should not be mentioned as missing
# translations on the autogenerated translation status pages.
# Every line in this file is used as a pattern for grep, and any file
# containing any of the patterns is left out on the status pages.
# Lines start with blank so they only match the start of the filename.
