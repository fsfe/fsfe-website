<h1>"I Love Free Software Day" 2023: Meet &amp; Connect</h1>

<p>On the 14th of February Free Software enthusiasts celebrated the 13th edition of the “I ❤️ Fee Software Day”! Hundreds of people and numerous organisations shared their love for Free Software and reached out to the ones behind these projects. Thank you for taking part in the celebration of our favourite type of software: Free Software.</p>

<p>For this years’ celebration of “I Love Free Software Day”, the Free Software Foundation Europe has organised <a href="activities/ilovefs/report/report_2023.html">several meetups and events all across Europe</a>. The FSFE local groups in Spain, England, Portugal, Greece, Germany, and Switzerland have taken up the call of the FSFE to get together and celebrate their love for software freedom in person. Even Free Software contributors from outside the FSFE have joined the call and organised a meeting, like the one in Austria and Barcelona.</p>

<p>Apart from the visible presence on Twitter and in the Fediverse, the FSFE has also said <strong>thank you</strong>, in a more old-school way, to numerous projects with our <a hef="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#ilovefs">newly designed postcards</a>.</p>

<p>This activity has been well received and it was awesome to see how much joy a thank you can spread. The Free Software project DAVx⁵, who was among the recipients of the postcards, shared their happiness about the postcards in the Fediverse and thanked the FSFE for such a kind gesture.</p>
