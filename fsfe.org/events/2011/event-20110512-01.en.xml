      <p>
        FSFE will have a stand at the LinuxTag in Berlin. Of course,
        everyone is invited to meet us at the booth and have a chat.
        Furthermore, on Thursday evening,
        May the 12th, we invite everyone to join us around 7 p.m. to go
        eat or drink something all together.
        This will be our Fellowship meeting for May.
