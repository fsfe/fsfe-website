  SFP#2 about KDE with Lydia Pintscher
</h1>

<p>
 We are back with the second episode of our Software Freedom Podcast! 
 Once a month, we talk with people who have inspiring ideas about 
 software freedom. In this episode, we talk with Lydia Pintscher from 
 KDE about the development of the KDE community, the different KDE projects 
 and the issues they will be tackling over the next two years.

 When we were planning this second episode of the Software Freedom Podcast,
 we were keen on inviting someone from the Free Software community. We 
 thought that Lydia, as the current Vice President of KDE, would be the 
 perfect person to join us for our second episode. This gives us the chance 
 to introduce to you the wonderful KDE community and all its different projects. 
 In this episode, we talk about how Lydia balances her day job with the 
 volunteer position of vice president of KDE. We also discuss some broader 
 topics like the development of the KDE community and the different projects 
 they are working on, as well as the future outlook of these projects.
