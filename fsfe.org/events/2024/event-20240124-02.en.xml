        <title>FSFE Local Group Meeting in Aarhus in Aarhus, Denmark</title>

    <body>
      <p>The next meeting in our network will be next Wednesday at 19:00 at PROSA, Søren Frichs Vej 38K th., 8230 Åbyhøj.</p>
      <p>It is not far from Magenta's office on Silkeborgvej, where we have had meetings before.</p>
      <p>If you can't attend physically, you can also participate virtually at this link:</p>
      <p>https://conf.fsfe.org/b/agg-7dv-5uq-l8l</p>
      <p>The agenda is a general resumption of our work - and I would especially like to talk about what we can do to get Ada&amp;Zangemann published in Danish.
