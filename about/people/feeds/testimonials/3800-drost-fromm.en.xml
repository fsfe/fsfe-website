      I believe Free Software needs a voice at the national as well as the EU
      level in politics: Software does not exist in an isolated bubble, it's
      heavily dependent on the ecosystem that it lives in. In my opinion Free
      Software as well as open standards are key to creating a society that
      provides equal access.
