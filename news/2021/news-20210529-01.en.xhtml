	<h1>20 Years FSFE: Time traveller Cory Doctorow sends his 
	wishes from utopian 2041!</h1>
		
		<p>
		Prolific Sci-fi author Cory Doctorow envisions the world in 2041 and 
		informs us that we were able to solve major world problems thanks to 
		collective work and sharing of knowledge.  Doctorow is thanking the 
		FSFE for our 20 years ahead contribution of fostering freedom and 
		disestablishing monopolies.</p>

			<p>
		Cory Doctorow is a British-Canadian writer, author of several Sci-fi 
		novels, who has been blogging for twenty years now. He was co-editor of 
		the blog boingboing.net and now runs his own blog at <a 
		href="https://pluralistic.net">Pluralistic</a>. Doctorow is one of the 
		trailblazers in the demands of digital rights and software freedom. He 
		speaks in favour of a less restrictive copyright law; his books are 
		published under Creative Commons licenses. His Sci-fi books often deal 
		with the ownership of technological means in the future. </p>

		   <p>
		For over a decade, he has been vocal in supporting the work of the 
		FSFE. This year,  he is celebrating the 20 year anniversary of FSFE in 
		his own fascinating way. He greets us and congratulates us on our 40 
		year anniversary, talking to us from 2041. In the video you will find 
		below you can see how Doctorow fits the FSFE into his vision of 2041. </p>

	<h2>How does Cory Doctorow envision the future?</h2>
			<p>
			In Doctorow's 2041, the world has faced many large scale natural 
			disasters, but paradoxically humanity thrives. The solution was to face 
			these challenges collectively and leave the spirit of competition 
			behind. Doctorow sees the value of cooperation in Free Software, 
			contrasting it to corporation monopolies. In this context, he thanks 
			FSFE for its priceless contribution to a better world during the years 
			2021-2041.</p>

			<p>You can read the full transcript of the video below. Cory Doctorow was 
			also our guest in the very <a href="/news/podcast/episode-1.html">first 
			episode of our Software Freedom Podcast</a> which mainly focuses on 
			Digital Restriction Management. </p>

	<h2>...since you're here: Brand new FSFE20 sticker</h2>
			<p>In 2021 the Free Software Foundation Europe turns 20. 
			This means two decades of 
			<a href="/about/about.html">empowering users to control 
			technology</a>. We want to give momentum to the FSFE and 
			even more to our pan-European community, the community that 
			has formed and always will form the shoulders that our 
			movement relies on. To help you celebrating 20 Years of 
			FSFE with us, we have produced a brand new logo sticker. <a 
			href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#fsfe-since-2001-sticker">Get 
			it, shout it, share it!</a></p>

	<h2>Script of Cory Doctorow's  birthday wishes for the FSFE</h2>

		<blockquote>    
			<p>
			Hello FSFE, congratulations from the year 2041 on your forty years of 
			fighting for the digital rights of Europeans and of all people in all 
			places! It has been a couple of crazy decades since I spoke to you last 
			year on 2021.</p>


			<p>In those two decades we have seen massive decentralization of the 
			internet thanks and part to deep reforms to our anti-trust and monopoly 
			law, mandates for interoperability and open APIs. And of course the 
			changes in our economic system that arose from the great crises we have 
			endured over the past two decades; floods, fires, famine, refugee 
			crises, all of the pandemics that we lived through.</p>


			<p>It was only by realizing that we have to cooperate rather than 
			compete, that we had to expose our technical infrastructure to outside 
			scrutiny and to outside improvement if we were going to survive crisis 
			after crisis that we were able to finally orient ourselves and our 
			economy and our political project and our technological project towards 
			weathering the storm that we had all seen coming but that no one seemed 
			able to confront.</p>


			<p>After all, that turned out to be the difference between crisis and a 
			happy ending, between dystopia and utopia. It was not whether the heat 
			that we had sunk into the ocean would melt the poles at will, nor 
			whether the coastal cities were drown - they have. Nor whether the 
			wildfires would rage - they did. But whether when they arose, when 
			these crises came to us we confronted them head on or continued to deny 
			them, continued to pretend that we could lock up technical knowledge 
			behind proprietary walls, that we could lock up control of 
			technological systems in the hands of four or five digital robber 
			barons* who insisted that no government had jurisdiction over them and 
			that they were accountable to no one except their shareholders.</p>


			<p>Once we realized that, once we embraced the ethic of collective work 
			for a better future for our species, then we were able to turn the tie 
			- not by averting the crises that were already set in motion, but by 
			addressing them when they arose.</p>


			<p>Thank you FSFE for the work that you did on that, and thank you to all 
			the organizations allied with us around the world, who joined to make 
			that reality happen.</p> 

			<p>Cory Doctorow</p>

<h3>About "20 Years FSFE"</h3>
		<p> In 2021 the Free Software 
		Foundation Europe turns 20. This means two decades of <a 
		href="/about/about.html">empowering users to control technology</a> 
		. </p> <figure> <img 
		src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/53aeebdafa0a0c83324dcafc1e4bef1c.png" 
		alt="Banner with FSFE 20 years. FSFE since 2001"/> </figure>
		
		<p> Turning 20 is a time when we like to take a breath and to look back 
		on the road we have come, to reflect the milestones we have passed, 
		the successes we have achieved, the stories we have written and the 
		moments that brought us together and that we will always joyfully 
		remember. In 2021 we want to give momentum to the FSFE and even 
		more to our pan-European community, the community that has formed 
		and always will form the shoulders that our movement relies on. 
		</p> <p> <strong> 20 Years FSFE is meant to be a celebration of 
		everyone who has accompanied us in the past or still does. Thank 
		you for contributing your piece of the puzzle that shapes the FSFE 
		and setting the foundation for the next decades' work of the 
		movement for software freedom. </strong> </p>
