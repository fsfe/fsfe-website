		<h1>The FSFE needs you to continue spreading software freedom in Europe!</h1> 

		<p>Since 2001 the Free Software Foundation Europe empowers software users to exert control over the technology that is so deeply involved in every aspect of our lives today. As a non-profit organisation, our work is backed by the continuous and generous contributions of our supporters. From public campaigns to policy monitoring, from removing legal barriers to helping organisations in understanding how Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination, our supporters have helped to finance our work. </p>

		<p>On the European level, 2019 will be a particularly crucial year for software freedom and technological rights that will need your support. The EU Copyright Directive currently moving its way through formal Trilogue discussions threatens to impede the free flow of online information and enact onerous new legal barriers for Free Software developers. The looming elections for the EU Parliament in May will seat politicians with the legislative power to impact the Free Software movement in Europe for the next five years. </p>
		
		<p>To help them get started, we are releasing a comprehensive policy brochure as part of our "Public Money? Public Code!" campaign, which will be used to provide candidates for the EU elections in Spring 2019 with background information about the benefits of Free Software for the public sector. We will also hand over our signatures from individuals and organisations in Europe in our "Public Money? Public Code!" open letter, and continue our movement to demand that code paid for by the people should be freely available to the people.</p>
		
		<p>And of course, in 2019 the FSFE will again use public awareness campaigns and political lobbying, provide our expertise, and produce promotional material and explanatory videos, to bring our community to diverse events in Europe and let them talk about the freedom of software. To achieve our goals, we base our work and form our movement with the help of our community and friends, who ensure that our message gets out and is heard in as many diverse parts of our society as possible. </p>
		
		<p>    You can directly help us to master these upcoming challenges in 2019 by <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/support">becoming a supporter of the FSFE</a>. Any amount that you give will be greatly appreciated. Your contribution makes a huge impact today, tomorrow, and ongoing!</p>
