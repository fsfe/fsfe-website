<h1>Exceptions against Router Freedom undermine users’ rights in Italy</h1>

<p>In 2018 Italy implemented Router Freedom. However regulatory decisions in 
2019 and 2023 introduced exceptions for fiber networks. The Free Software 
Foundation Europe has now urged Italy’s telecom regulator, 
AGCOM, to remove these restrictions and fully restore users' rights to choose 
their own equipment to connect to fiber networks.</p>

<p>In 2018, Italy was one of the first countries in Europe to implement <a href="https://www.agcom.it/provvedimenti/delibera-348-18-cons">specific rules 
supporting Router Freedom</a>. However, since then, the national regulator AGCOM has introduced a series of exceptions 
undermining <a href="/activities/routers/routers.html">Router Freedom 
rights</a>, negatively impacting the rights of consumers to use their own equipment to connect to fiber networks. The 
FSFE has <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-agcom-fiber-en-24.pdf">prepared a study on why Router Freedom should be respected in Italy</a>, urging AGCOM to reconsider its decision based on 
European standardized requirements for Router Freedom.</p>

<h3>Regulatory exceptions and certification procedures against Router 
Freedom</h3> 

<p>In 2019, Italian telecom operators pushed for an 
exception against Router Freedom in fiber networks, <a href="https://www.agcom.it/provvedimenti/comunicazione-2-luglio-2019.">which 
AGCOM 
confirmed</a>. This exception significantly limited the ability of 
consumers to use their own modems to  connect directly to the fiber 
network. AGCOM’s decision allowed internet service providers (ISPs) to 
impose the use of optical network terminals (ONTs), with the exception 
of personal routers on bridge mode. In 2020, BEREC set <a href="/news/2020/news-20200601-01.html">standardized 
requirements for national regulators</a> to evaluate Router Freedom. 
However, the Italian regulator has not re-assessed its decision. In 
contrast, <a href="/news/2021/news-20210805-01.html">the Netherlands</a> 
and <a href="/news/2023/news-20231113-02.html">Belgium</a> committed to 
Router Freedom for all 
type of networks, following the evaluation criteria proposed by 
BEREC.</p>
 
<p>In 2022, Router Freedom faced another setback in Italy during <a href="https://www.agcm.it/dotcmsdoc/bollettini/2022/7-22.pdf">an 
antitrust case ruled upon by the Italian competition authority, AGCM</a>. The 
largest telecom operator in the country, TIM, was requested to allow 
terminal equipment from other ISPs in its fiber network. While this 
commitment would have the potential to establish Router Freedom in the 
country, TIM proposed a certification procedure for any device seeking 
to be connected to the operator’s network. However, the costs involved 
in the certification procedures were prohibitive (around 100.000 
euros), and TIM required that the device should be certified again 
after every software update. Nevertheless, in 2023, the Italian telecom 
authority<a href="https://www.agcom.it/provvedimenti/delibera-11-23-cir"> homologated 
this antitrust agreement</a>, reducing the 
certification costs. These certification schemes are contrary to net 
neutrality and open internet, because they create  barriers for 
end-users to use the equipment of their choice. As example, <a href="https://www.acm.nl/system/files/documents/beleidsregel-handhaving-besluit-eindapparaten.pdf">the 
Dutch 
regulator ACM decided in 2021 against any kind of obligatory 
certification procedures or device black-list</a> against router 
manufacturers, requesting ISPs in the country to make the network 
interoperable with any router that complies with EU device 
regulations.</p>

<h3>Router Freedom matters – also for Italy</h3>

<p>The FSFE has prepared a <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-agcom-fiber-en-24.pdf">study explaining why it is necessary for 
AGCOM to re-evaluate its position in respect to freedom of terminal 
equipment</a>. We argue that the Italian regulator should apply the 
BEREC Guidelines on the NTP to decide on this matter. The Belgian 
and Dutch regulation authorities have followed the BEREC procedure and have not 
found any technological necessity to limit Router Freedom in their 
respective countries. The study concludes that allowing end-users to 
choose and use their own terminal equipment supports their best 
interests regarding privacy, data protection and security. Freedom of 
terminal equipment is also key for fair competition, market innovation, 
technical interoperability and digital sustainability.</p>

<h2>Router Freedom needs your support!</h2> 

<p><a href="/activities/routers/index.html">Router Freedom</a> is the 
right that customers of any Internet Service Provider (ISP) are able to 
choose and use a private modem and router instead of equipment provided 
by the operator. Since 2013, the Free Software Foundation Europe has 
been successfully engaged with Router Freedom, promoting end-users’ 
freedom in many European countries. Join us and learn more about the 
<a href="/news/2021/news-20210330-01.html">several ways to get

you help make possible our long-term engagement and professional 
commitment in defending people’s rights to control technology.</p>
