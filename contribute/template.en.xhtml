    <h1 class="p-name">A template article, to use the new webdesign</h1>

    <div class="e-content">

    <p class="p-summary">
        So, you are publishing an article on fsfe.org? Let’s have a look at
        this <a href="/source/template.en.xhtml">template page source code</a> to see how you can make use of the many
        features at your disposal with this new design!
        <a class="fn" id="ref-name-that-footnote" href="#fn-name-that-footnote">1</a> 
        All code samples are pasted directly from the source file of this page.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just like before, fsfe.org web pages are built from xml source files.
        You can actually see the source code directly by clicking on the link
        at <a href="#source">the bottom of each page</a>. So there’s no big
        change here, go on to read more about the website in genral if you want
        to know more (there’s a link in the sidebar, on the right).
    </p>

    <h2>Page styling and metadata</h2>

    <p>
        The first thing with the new design are the <code>&#60;body&#62;</code>
        attributes. This page has:
    </p>

    <pre><code>&#60;body class="article" microformats="h-entry" id="the-template-2014"&#62;</code></pre>

    <p>
        A file can have more than one class and more than one microformats
        (separated by a space), but a file can only have one id. These
        attributes are very useful to have different kinds of styling depending
        on what kind of content we’re showing. 
    </p>

    <p>
        For instance, the page <a href="/about/">About FSFE</a> is not an
        article, but one of the four main sections of the website. It’s a way
        to get to other pages relating to what FSFE is about. For this kind of
        pages, there are some specific styling (using <code>&#60;body
        class="subsite"&#62;</code>). In doubt, it’s always useful to find a
        page that’s as close as possible to what you have to edit, and see how
        this one is made. And of course, you can always <a
            href="https://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/web">get in touch
        with the web team</a>. What’s more, all pages which are on
        wiki.fsfe.org have the wiki class, all pages on planet.fsfe.org have the
        planet class, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, all articles should have an "article" class. However, it is
        optional for them to have an id. If you put an id, please choose it
        carefully. Id can be very useful to apply very specific styling. If you
        need to write new CSS style for a page, please make sure to put an id
        and then use that id for the rules in the CSS files.
    </p>

    <p>
        Microformats attribute are both about style and about metadata of a
        page.  If you want to know what microformats are, please read <a
            href="http://microformats.org">microformats.org</a>. If you are not
        going to use microformats markup inside a source file, there’s no need
        to enable them, so remove the "microformats" information from the
        &#60;body&#62; element. This page, as most articles, news entries,
        event items, should have proper metadata and use microformats.
    </p>


    <p>
        Articles should use the <a
            href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry">h-entry
        microformat</a>. This page has:
    </p>

    <pre><code>&#60;body class="article" <strong>microformats="h-entry"</strong> id="the-template-2014"&#62;
    &#60;p id="category" class="p-category"&#62;
      &#60;a href="/contribute/contribute.html"&#62;Contribute&#60;/a&#62;
    &#60;/p&#62;
    &#60;h1 class="p-name"&#62;A template article, to use the new webdesign&#60;/h1&#62;

    &#60;div class="e-content"&#62;

    &#60;p class="p-summary"&#62;So, you are…

    …

    &#60;/div&#62;&#60;!--/e-content--&#62;
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        The rest of the metadata (author, date, etc.) should be taken care of.
        But do not hesitate to use other h-entry classes in the body of the
        article, and <a
            href="http://indiewebify.waterpigs.co.uk/validate-h-entry/">check
            their validity</a>. If you want to know more about how fsfe.org
        deals with other metadata like tags, author, dates, etc. you can read
        the <a href="/source/template.en.xhtml">source code of this page</a>. You should also <a
            href="/contribute/web/tagging.fr.html">read the how-to on tagging
        fsfe.org</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>The sidebar</h2>

    <aside>
        <p>
            By the way, did you notice that, if you inspect the HTML of this page
            as rendered in your web browser, each title automatically gets an id?
            That way you can easily <a href="#id-the-sidebar">link to a specific
                part</a> of a page on fsfe.org by using anchors. For example, the title
            above probably has <code>&#60;h2 id="<a
                href="#id-the-sidebar">id-the-sidebar</a>"&#62;The
            sidebar&#60;h2&#62;</code>
        </p>
    </aside>

    <pre><code>&#60;sidebar news="ilovefs" promo="about-fsfe"&#62;
    &#60;div id="related-content"&#62;
        &#60;h3&#62;Get involved&#60;/h3&#62;

        &#60;ul&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href="/contribute/web/web.html"&#62;Webmastering&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
        &#60;li&#62;&#60;a href="/contribute/editors/editors.html"&#62;Information for editors&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;
        &#60;li&#62;&#60;a href="/contribute/contribute.html"&#62;Contribute&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62; 
        
        &#60;h4&#62;Ongoing campaigns&#60;/h4&#62;
        &#60;ul&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href="//documentfreedom.org"&#62;Document Freedom Day!&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;
    &#60;/div&#62;
&#60;/sidebar&#62;
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        The sidebar is what’s showing on the right side of this very page (if
        your screen is large enough!). Articles should really have a sidebar
        and we encourage you to add things in it. They are useful to provide
        context to an article, and to give more things to read if somebody’s
        interested. So you should show related articles, and/or related
        campaigns if that makes sense. See the code above: you can write
        directly inside the <code>&#60;sidebar&#62;</code> elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, the sidebar is not just another place to write, it’s also a
        useful tool where we can automatically put stuff. So if you are very lazy,
        or if there’s nothing to write in, just write
        <code>&#60;sidebar&#62;</code> without anything in it, and the build system
        will automatically decide what to show for you. Note: the sidebar
        element should be after the body element, not within. It’s at the same
        place that timestamp, tags and translator elements.
    </p>

    <h3>Sidebar options</h3>

    <p>You can also give parameters to your sidebar. This page has the following sidebar parameters:</p>

    <pre><code>&#60;sidebar news="ilovefs" promo="about-fsfe"&#62;</code></pre>

    <p>The news value is <a href="/contribute/web/tagging.html">a tag</a>.
    It’s going to fetch some news items that match the given tag and display
    them in the sidebar. For matter of demonstration, this page displays links
    to news items with the "ilovefs" tag.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The news feature of the sidebar is disabled until
    Nicolas finds a better way of building the tag. Your help is welcome!</p>

    <p>The promo parameter is a paragraph promoting one important aspect of
    FSFE. This page promotes the "about-fsfe" paragraph, which is a general
    paragraph about FSFE which is going to invite the user to go read the
    about-page. If you don’t want to show any promotional paragraph, set
    <code>promo="no"</code>. If you do not choose which paragraph to promote in
    your sidebar, the build system is going to default to one paragraph for
    you.</p>

    <p>These paragraphs should already be ready for translation like other
    generic parts of the website. For now, you can choose to promote among:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>our-work</li>
        <li>about-fsfe</li>
        <li>donate</li>
        <li>More to come… Do not hesitate to ask the web team to add one.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Table of contents</h3>

    <p>Right now, it’s not automated. But the sidebar should be very a nice place
    to add a table of contents, especially if you wrote a long article. More to
    come on that.</p>

    <h2>The follow-up</h2>

    <p>It’s important to help people engage and support FSFE and to make it
    easy for them. This is why we have the "followup" box. This box is the
    second section of each page on fsfe.org, which you can see below the
    license information of this page. Why is it at the bottom? The idea is
    that, if somebody reaches the end of an article on fsfe.org, it’s probably
    a very good sign that this person is interested! So we should engage with
    them, give them a way to follow up on that enthusiasm! By default, if you
    don’t put anything, the build system is going to insert a followup box for
    you. If you don’t want to show a followup box for some reason, then please
    write <code>&#60;followup&#62;no&#60;/followup&#62;</code>.</p>

    <p>This page chooses to help people engage by subscribing to our monthly
    newsletter. So, after the body element, it has:</p>

    <pre><code>&#60;followup&#62;subscribe-nl&#60;/followup&#62;</code></pre>

    <p>These boxes should already be ready for translation like other generic
    parts of the website. For now, you can choose to follow up on:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>"subscribe-nl" to subscribe to the newsletter</li>
        <li>"support" to sign as a supporter</li>
        <li>"donate" to make a one-time or recurrent donation</li>
        <li>"join" to promote joining the fellowship</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Misc</h2>

    <p>If you need to add a quote, proceed as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec a diam lectus. Sed sit amet ipsum mauris. Maecenas congue ligula ac quam viverra nec consectetur ante hendrerit. Donec et mollis dolor. Praesent et diam eget libero egestas mattis sit amet vitae augue. Nam tincidunt congue enim, ut porta lorem lacinia consectetur. Donec ut libero sed arcu vehicula ultricies a non tortor. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean ut gravida lorem. Ut turpis felis, pulvinar a semper sed, adipiscing id dolor. Pellentesque auctor nisi id magna consequat sagittis. Curabitur dapibus enim sit amet elit pharetra tincidunt feugiat nisl imperdiet. Ut convallis libero in urna ultrices accumsan. Donec sed odio eros. Donec viverra mi quis quam pulvinar at malesuada arcu rhoncus.

        <footer>
            – <cite>Cicero</cite>
        </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Alternative, you can also <q cite="http://example.org">quote an example inline</q> (the quotation marks will vary depending on the language).</p>


    <div class="captioned" style="max-width: 2000px;">
        <header>
            <p>An article would not be complete without a picture!</p>
        </header>
        <img src="https://hroy.eu/images/fsfe_ecm-group_pic/2013-09-ECM-group-picture.JPG" alt="group picture!" />
        <footer>
            <p>This is a picture from the Group coordinators meeting in Berlin, September 2013!</p>
        </footer>
    </div>

    <p>If you want to use the <code>div class="captioned"</code> to display
    a picture like the above, please specify a <code>style="max-width:
        Xpx;"</code> property where X is the width of the picture.</p> 

    <p>If you want to center the picture, add the <code>center-block</code>
    class. If you want to make it float on the left, add the class
    <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code> to make it float… to the
    right!</p>

    <h2>General design</h2>

    <p>Please avoid adding inline css styles in your css. Use css classes
    instead. If you need new classes, create new classes, or try to see if the
    current design does not already solve what you want to do! Also check with
    bootstrap if there’s not something standard to use. To understand how to
    edit the stylesheets of the new design, <a
    href="/contribute/web/css.html">head to the documentation</a>.</p>

    <p>The new design uses bootstrap.  Visit <a
        href="http://getbootstrap.com/">getbootstrap.com</a> for more
    information about that. This should allow you to have some nice things on
    fsfe.org pages now! However if you are doing something a bit out of the
    ordinary or if you are not sure of yourself, do not hesitate to <a
        href="https://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/web">get in touch
    with the web team</a>.</p>

    <h2>Some notes on typography</h2>

    <p>Typography matters. Please, if you share my love for typography, letters, spaces and symboles, try to use curly quotes and real apostrophes. I know this article did not respect that rule and used "stright quotes" instead of “curly quotes” because I needed to imitate the source code in order not to confuse anyone. However, for most articles on fsfe.org there’s no need for this. Especially, since we use utf-8, there’s no reason not to put some utf-8 in our pages! ☺ </p>


    <h2>Other examples to take inspiration from</h2>

    <p>This template should get you going for most articles, i.e. pages which
    are mostly about “content”. However, not all pages are like that. So here’s
    a selection of well designed pages that should help you to get some
    inspiration from.</p>

    <p>
    If you have trouble producing the correct quotation marks for your language on your keyboard, look up the html escapes in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark_glyphs#Quotation_marks_in_Unicode">the wikipedia article</a> (or <a href="http://unicode-table.com/en/sets/quotation-marks/">unicode table</a>).
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://test.fsfe.org/about/about.en.html">Subsite pages</a> for navigating to different parts of the website.</li>
        <li><a href="http://test.fsfe.org/news/2014/news-20140116-01.en.html">Press Releases</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://test.fsfe.org/news/nl/nl-201401.en.html">Newsletters</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://test.fsfe.org/about/roy/roy.en.html">Personal Bio pages</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://test.fsfe.org/fr/index.en.html">Country page</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://test.fsfe.org/fellowship/card.en.html">Fellowship page</a> (You might also want to edit <code>/tools/menu-global.xml</code> and <code>/tools/texts-**.xml</code>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="fn">Footnotes</h2>
    <ol> 
      <li id="fn-name-that-footnote">
      This is just a footnote! Please read <a href="/source/template.en.xhtml">the source code of this page</a> to see
      how footnotes should be made.
