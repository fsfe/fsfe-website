        <title>Device Neutrality: Digital Sovereingty over Devices in Aveiro, Portugal</title>

    <body>
      <p>Although digital devices are ubiquitous today, the number of devices on which users cannot run Free Software is exponentially increasing. The consequence is an increased loss of control over users' technology. Device Neutrality aims to enable end-users to bypass gatekeepers to have a non-discriminatory use of Free Software on their devices. </p>
      <p>Lucas Lasota, FSFE's Programme Manager Legal, will speak at &quot;Encontro Nacional de Estudantes de Informatica&quot; in Aveiro, Portugal, about Device Neutrality. The talk takes place on 30.09. The language is Portuguese. The event is free but requires registration.</p>
