      <p>IT-tinkering is only possible with Free Software, that's why the FSFE local group Berlin is going to be present with an information and merchandise booth at the Maker Fair in Berlin. The Maker Fair is a get-together of makers and visitors interested in various DIY-ideas. At the FSFE’s booth, visitors can inform themselves about Raspberry Pi as a computer for standard applications especially suitable for education, about how to ‘free’ Android-Smartphones and about email-encryption with Free Software.</p>
