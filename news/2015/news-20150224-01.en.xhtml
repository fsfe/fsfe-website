	<h1>Call for events: Be a part of Document Freedom Day 2015</h1>
            
	<p newsteaser="yes">Document Freedom Day (#DFD2015) is a global campaign for document liberation, with grassroots events throughout the world taking place on March 25, 2015. Add your voice to this worldwide celebration of Open Standards, and <a href="https://www.documentfreedom.org/registerevent.html">register your DFD event for 2015!</a>.</p>

    
	<p>Every year since 2008, people who care about a free information society celebrate Document Freedom Day to raise awareness of <a href="/activities/os/">Open Standards</a>. On this day activists around the world come together to talk about access to communications, run local public activities, and generally spread the word about Open Standards in a dozen different ways. Be part of the movement  and <a href="https://www.documentfreedom.org/registerevent.html">sign up your DFD team today!</a></p>
    
	<h2>How to get involved</h2>
    
	  <blockquote><p>"Every year, the most important part of this campaign is being done by people just like yourself that run local events around the world. For this, we have made it easier than ever to organise an event" says Erik Albers, head of the international Document Freedom Day team. "We are offering <a href="https://www.documentfreedom.org/promotion.html">promotion materials</a> in many languages, and  <a href="https://gitorious.org/document_freedom_day/artwork">artwork you can remix, share and improve</a> to publicise your own event."</p></blockquote>
      
	<p>To coordinate this year's DFD campaign, FSFE's Document Freedom Day team has also built a <a href="https://www.documentfreedom.org/index.html">shiny new website</a>, making it easier for you to get in touch with other people participating in DFD around the world, and with FSFE's campaign staff. </p> 
        
	<p>If you are running a local event, we may be able to offer <a href="https://www.documentfreedom.org/funding-expenses.html">funding of your local activities or your local print runs</a> - thanks to <a href="https://www.documentfreedom.org/sponsors.html">DFD's generous sponsors</a>.
