  <p>Valentine's Day traditionally is a day to show and
  celebrate love. So why do not take this as a chance to show your love for <a
    href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> this year?</p>

</div>


<h2>We love Free Software</h2>

<p>As every year, Valentine's Day will be celebrated on the 14th of
February, which will be a Saturday this year. Similar to <a
href="/news/2014/news-20140221-01.html">last year</a>, the FSFE is
planning an online campaign to celebrate this day as an "I love Free
Software" - Day. </p>

</div>

<p>Last year's campaign was simply fantastic! We read a lot of 
interesting blog posts and media articles about specific pieces of 
software or Free Software in general. On Microblogs there was a 
overwhelming #ilovefs storm the whole day and all over the world people 
thanked developers for their great work by mail or in person. Even 
politicians showed their love for Free Software because of its 
important meaning in times of surveillance and cloud lock-in.</p>

<p>This year we move the focus on people. Free Software is not 
developed by machines but by humans like you. Of course, the lines of 
code they share with us and the society are a very important part of 
our daily life but the fact that they spend a lot of their free or work 
time for Free Software matters much more. They are the foundation of 
the freedom we appreciate.</p>

<p>And let's not forget that Free Software is not only written code but 
also builds upon various contributions like design, translations, 
testing, or documentation. One cannot work without the other and we 
should say "thank you" to everybody's effort.</p>

<h2>Show your love</h2> 

<p>Of course there are lots of ways to declare one's love. Everybody 
likes Free Software <a 
href="/activities/ilovefs/whylovefs/whylovefs.html">for a variety of 
reasons</a>. Here are just some ideas about how you can go public and 
proclaim your love to Free Software.</p>

parliamentary group with an ilovefs picture" width="100%" />
  </div>
  
  <li><strong>Pictures</strong> A picture is worth thousand words. Show 
  the world that you love Free Software and the people behind it by 
  making an individual photo. Maybe a picture with you and a chalkboard 
  with your favourite developer or software on it? An #ilovefs balloon 
  with your city in the background? We already have a <a 
  href="/activities/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.html">small photo 
  gallery</a> with some pictures which might inspire you but there are 
  a lot more possibilities and we are looking forward to seeing your 
  creative ideas as well! </li>

  </div>

  <li><strong>Postcards</strong> On Valentine's Day there are many 
  people to show your love to and maybe you are in trouble to remember 
  all of them. Not this year! Get some of our "I love Free Software - 
  but I love you more" postcards and send them to the people you like. 
  You can <a 
  href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#ilovefs-campaign">order them on 
  our promotion page</a> and we would be happy to receive a small 
  donation to cover the costs.</li>

  <li><strong>(Micro)Blog</strong> Last year we saw many blog posts 
  about specific software and aspects of Free Software <a 
  href="/news/2014/news-20140221-01.html#id-more-blog-posts">people want to 
  emphasise</a>. This is a great opportunity to present and recommend a 
  Free Software you really like or to explain why Free Software is a 
  crucial part of your daily life. Maybe you also want to thank a 
  certain contributor, developer or group for their great work? </li>

  <li><strong>Donate</strong> Last but not least people also appreciate 
  coffee, tea or beer. So why not stand a contributor something? If she or he 
  lives nearby invite them for a drink or donate to their project. And if 
  you cannot decide for a certain individual or software, you can also 
  <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">donate to the FSFE</a> or <a 
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/DonateToFreeSoftwareProjects">other 
  supporters of Free Software</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>If everybody contributes a small part we can enjoy a beautiful "I 
love Free Software" day together. Let's share pictures, send postcards, 
tweets and blog posts, and show our love individually. Happy 
I love Free Software day everyone!</p>
