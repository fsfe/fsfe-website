    <title>OpenRheinRuhr, Bottrop, Germany</title>
    <body>
	OpenRheinRuhr 2009 in Bottrop is the largest exhibition 
	concerning Free Software in Germany's Ruhr Area. Some of 
	our German Fellows help to organize this convention or
	present Free Software projects they are working on. Hence 
	FSFE will not miss the opportunity to contribute to this event 
	with a booth. On November 7 and 8 we bring the idea of Free 
	Software and its related topics to the public again.
	This time we intent to cross the border from IT into the Arts 
	by providing a discussion lounge to broach the issues of 
	"Software as a cultural technique" and "Coding as an art".
	In addition to the booth a social event for Fellows will be 
	held on 2009-11-07.
	Further information about the booth and how to volunteer can 
	be found in the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/OpenRheinRuhr09">wiki</a>. 
	Coordination is handled via the 
	<a href="https://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/booth">booth mailing list</a>.
