<h1 class="p-name">Timeline of compulsory routers</h1>

<div class="e-content">

<div id="introduction">

<p>Compulsory routers are a delicate topic and just because of that 
very complex. Many government agencies, corporations, and organisations 
already contributed to the public discussion and took part in numerous 
hearings and comments. Here the FSFE lists the most important events 
which lead to the current state and also draws a picture of the future 
development of compulsory routers.</p> </div>

<h2>Current state and glance into the future</h2>

<p>After almost three years of intensive debates, the German Bundestag 
passed the law for „choice and connection of telecommunication terminal 
devices“. This law unambigously declares compulsory routers invalid and 
establishes freedom of choice of terminal devices.</p>

<p>The passed law became effective on August 1 2016. The FSFE monitors 
the compliance of the law and asks its supporters, other organisations 
and administrations to do the same.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>01.08.2016</strong>: The law comes into effect. <a 
  href="/news/2016/news-20160725-01.html">From now on</a> all Internet 
  Service Providers have to enable new clients to use alternative 
  modems and routers to connect to the internet. The FSFE is monitoring 
  the implementation by sending out testing devices to volunteers for 
  them to check whether their ISPs obey the law, and <a 
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters/Implementation/Germany">collecting 
  the results</a>.</li>
  
  <li><strong>27.11.2015</strong>: Although the Federal Council fought the bill 
  against compulsory routers in the first place, it now does not oppose it 
  anymore in its last consultation about it.</li>
  
  <li><strong>05.11.2015</strong>: The German Bundestag passes the 
  essentially unmodified law and thereby the abolishment of compulsory 
  routers.</li>
  
  <li><strong>28.10.2015</strong>: The FSFE and nine other 
  organisations in civil society and economy send <a 
  href="/activities/routers/files/20151027_Verbaendeschreiben.pdf">a 
  letter</a> to 132 parliament committee members in which they ask the 
  MPs to support the bill without any modifications.</li>
  
  <li><strong>07.10.2015</strong>: The Federal Cabinet and the BMWi 
  don't grant the demands for examining the draft. <a 
  href="/activities/routers/files/20151001_Gegenaeußerung_BK.pdf">In its 
  writing</a> the Cabinet clearly explains that there's no reason for 
  departing from the "technologically neutral implementation of 
  terminal device freedom in Germany" by adding exceptions for certain 
  providers or devices. </li>
  
  <li><strong>25.09.2015</strong>: The Federal Council publishes its <a 
  href="/activities/routers/files/20150925_BR-Stellungnahme.pdf">comments</a> 
  on the bill. It questiones the draft's essential foundations and 
  adopts arguments of network providers which only act as 
  pretence.</li>

  <li><strong>12.08.2015</strong>: The Federal Cabinet passes the <a 
  href="http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Redaktion/PDF/Gesetz/gesetzentwurf-der-bundesregierung-zur-auswahl-und-zum-anschluss-von-telekommunikationsendgeraeten,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi2012,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf">law 
  bill for router freedom</a> which is seen as positive by the FSFE. 
  The step follows the European Commission's notification and 
  commentary term until July 8th. During that phase only a small formal 
  ambiguity has been criticised.</li>

  <li><strong>25.02.2015</strong>: The German Ministry of Economics published a
     first <a
       href="http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Redaktion/PDF/P-R/referentenentwurf-gesetz-zur-auswahl-und-zum-anschluss-von-telekommunikationsendgeraeten,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi2012,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf">draft
       law to ban compulsory routers (German)</a>. Except missing enforcing measures
     FSFE welcomes the draft.</li>

	<li><strong>29.09.2014</strong>: 
	After the further procedures were unclear for a long time, <a 
	href="https://netzpolitik.org/2014/intransparente-transparenzverordnung-kehrt-zum-routerzwang-zurueck-wir-veroeffentlichen-den-aktuellen-entwurf/">Netzpolitik.org 
	published an internal revised draft of the transparency bill (German)</a>. 
	The <a href="/news/2014/news-20140929-01.html">FSFE critisises the 
	draft</a> because it legitimises the incapacitation of customers. Instead 
	of prohibiting compulsory routers as decided in the coalition agreement, 
	the draft enables internet providers to hinder customers who want to use 
	another device.</li>
   
    <li><strong>28.03.2014</strong>: 
        Together with the CCC and other projects and experts, the FSFE praises the basic 
        idea in a <a href="/news/2014/news-20140328-01.html">press release</a> and a
        <a href="/activities/routers/files/20140328_Stellungnahme-TKTransparenzV-FSFE.pdf">
        detailed statement (German)</a> but clearly criticises that users are further burdened
         and that the proposed test methods are inconsistently considered. Most interestingly, 
         the formulation of the regulation is substantially weaker than that in the coalition 
         agreement, and the still-unaddressed question of network termination points is not 
         even mentioned.</li>
    
    <li><strong>24.02.2014</strong>:
        After the first large hearing, the Federal Network Agency publishes a <a 
        href="/activities/routers/files/20140224_BNetzA-TKTransparenzV-Entwurf.pdf">
        transparency bill</a> that eliminates compulsory routers and should improve the
        transparency of telecommunication companies for customers. Comments
        may be submitted until the end of March 2014.</li>

    <li><strong>16.12.2013</strong>: 
     After the German Federal Parliament elections in the end of September, the coalition agreement
     is officially signed. In it, the CDU, CSU, and SPD clearly speak out against 
     compulsory routers and demand that <a href="/news/2013/news-20131211-01.html#1">
     every customer must receive all necessary access information unasked.</a>
     Such a clear statement of position from the coalition parties can be explained by
     the media response (for example from 
     <a href="http://www.golem.de/news/routerzwang-fsfe-warnt-vor-grossen-nachteilen-durch-provider-geraete-1311-102562.html">Golem (German)</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/FSFE-und-Konsumentenbund-beziehen-Stellung-gegen-Zwangsrouter-2039691.html">Heise (German)</a> and
  <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2013/routerzwang-ccc-fsfe-und-konsumentenbund-veroeffentlichen-stellungsnahmen/">Netzpolitik (German)</a> as well as 
  <a href="http://www.focus.de/digital/internet/nahrung-fuer-aengste-experten-gegen-router-zwang-von-internet-providern_aid_1150249.html">Focus (German)</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.fr-online.de/digital/experten-wenden-sich-gegen-routerzwang-beim-internet-zugang,27395004,24917956.html">Frankfurter Rundschau (German)</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.n-tv.de/technik/Routerzwang-nur-bei-Providern-beliebt-article11679651.html">NTV (German)</a> and
  <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/aktivisten-gegen-provider-mit-aller-macht-gegen-den-routerzwang-1.1811577">Süddeutsche (German)</a>)
   and the enormous interest from the population.</li>
    
    
    <li><strong>04.11.2013</strong>: The FSFE joins numerous other 
    organisations and individuals by sending an <a href="/activities/routers/files/20131104_Stellungnahme-Schnittstellen-398-FSFE.pdf">extensive public statement to the Federal Network Agency</a> (<a 
    href="/news/2013/news-20131104-02.html">here the press release</a>) upon 
    completion of the public hearings. The statement contains answers to 
    almost all the posed questions with specific regard to the existing and 
    potential disadvantages of compulsory routers.

    <p>The majority of the 309 statements argues against compulsory routers. 
    Unsurprisingly, the only two groups that are in favour are Internet Service Providers 
    and Network Providers. Notable arguments have been filed by e.g. AVM, CCC, 
    and Sipgate. The Federal Networking Agency has <a 
    href="/activities/routers/files/20140414_Verzeichnis-Stellungnahmen-3982013.pdf">collected all statements</a>.</p></li> 
    
    
    <li><strong>20.09.2013</strong>: The Federal Network Agency starts a <a 
    href="/activities/routers/files/20130920_Anhörung-Schnittstellen-3982013.pdf">public hearing (398/2013)</a> 
    on the disputed network termination points. At the hearing, many - partly very 
    technical - questions related to possible definitions are posed which are directly 
    related to compulsory routers. Just a few days later the FSFE publishes <a 
    href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/mk/routerzwang-fsfes-schreiben-zur-konsultation-der-bundesnetzagentur/">a preliminary statement</a>, 
    in which it voices serious concerns for security, consumer-friendliness, 
    and competition.</li>

 <li><strong>31.07.2013:</strong>: In a <a
    href="http://www.computerundrecht.de/netzneutralitaet-zweiter-entwurf(1).pdf">second 
    draft of the "net neutrality regulation", compulsory routers are discussed in §3</a> (PDF). 
    Contrary to the first draft, the term used now is “Endgerätenetzneutralität”, which (roughly)
    translates to "terminal device net neutrality".</li>

  <li><strong>25.06.2013</strong>: The Federal Network Agency organises a 
  workshop on the topic of compulsory routers and designs four models for resolution.</li>

  
   <li><strong>17.06.2013</strong>: The BMWi (Ministry of Economic) presents the <a
    href="http://www.cr-online.de/Netzneutralitaetsverordnung_Entwurf_des_BMWI_17.6.2013.pdf">draft 
    of a net neutrality regulation according to §41a Abs.1 TKG</a> (PDF). In §3, 
    compulsory routers are specifically addressed and rejected.</li>
    
    <li><strong>04.06.2013</strong>: The <a 
    href="/activities/routers/files/20130604_Antwort-Bundesregierung.pdf">federal 
    government responds to the "minor interpellation"</a> made on the 
    17th of May. In it, open questions are treated very carefully and responsibilities 
    are more or less redirected towards the Federal Network Agency. The BMWi 
    does not consider itself to be part of the topic, since the FNA at this point of 
    time still is involved in talks with Network Providers and router manufacturers. An <a 
    href="https://netzpolitik.org/2013/router-zwang-bundesregierung-unternimmt-nichts-bundesnetzagentur-will-nach-prufung-nochmal-reden/">article 
    on Netzpolitik</a> summarises these circumstances thoroughly.</li>
    
    
    <li><strong>17.05.2013</strong>: The fraction “DIE LINKE” poses a <a 
    href="/activities/routers/files/20130517_Kleine-Anfrage-Linke.pdf">“minor interpellation” 
    to the federal government</a> related to the statements made by the Federal Networking Agency. 
    In it, the question on whether a router qualifies as an access point or a telecommunication 
    device and in how far the end-user may interfere with it is posed.</li>
    
  
    <li><strong>22.01.2013</strong>: Among others, the German manufacturer 
    of telecommunication devices AVM <a href="http://avm.de/presse/presseinformationen/2013/avm-zu-aussagen-der-bundesnetzagentur-wegen-routerzwang-und-nichtherausgabe-von-kennwoertern/">comments on the issue</a> and 
    compares the situation with the mobile market, where providers 
    do not dictate to their customers which phone to use.</li>
    
      <li><strong>10.01.2013</strong>: The roots of the public debate of compulsory routers 
      can be found in a <a href="http://pastebin.com/F7UHra0h">reply to an anonymous user 
      made by the Federal Network Agency</a>. 
    The user criticises the coupling of his DSL contract with a specific router. He does so in reaction to an <a 
    href="http://www.pcwelt.de/ratgeber/Online-Keine_Chance_dem_Router-Zwang_-6945376.html">extensive article of the professional magazine "PC-WELT"</a>, 
    in which the common practices of DSL providers are criticised. 
    The Federal Networking Agency deems this behaviour to be justified, 
    since the DSL provider in question defines the router to be part of the 
    network and thus the infrastructure he provides. Therefore, the end-user 
    should and must not exchange it against another device.

<p>Here, the basic conflict becomes clear: the Federal Network Agency cannot 
or does not want to decide where the network of the Internet provider ends and 
from where the user has full control. Especially in terms of routers that include 
a modem and numerous other functions (IAD, Integrated Access Device), there 
are many unresolved issues and a need for clear definitions. </p></li>
