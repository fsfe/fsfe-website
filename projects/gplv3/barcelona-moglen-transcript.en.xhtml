<h2 id="begin">The presentation</h2>

<p>
[0h01m08s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Eben Moglen: So, I'm Eben Moglen, I'm a lawyer who works on the
production of freedom, mostly with the makers and distributors of Free
Software and mostly at the moment for one client, whom you know.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Because Richard was kind enough to go through the state of substantive affairs
in the drafting of GPL3, I want to take time this afternoon, before answering
your questions, to give some context for the effort that he described in detail.
</p>

<p>
[0h01m58s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
First I think I owe you as citizens of the Free Republic some more precise
information about the process and its state at present moment, and then I'd like
to talk a little bit about the larger aspects of our life in the Free Republic
into which GPL3 fits.
</p>

<p id="gates-surrender">[Section: First: Bill Gates has surrendered]</p>

<p class="indent">
But the first thing I think I have to do, is to give you some news: Mr. Gates
has surrendered.
</p>

<p>
[laughter]
</p>

<p class="indent">
And before we get all back to fighting again among ourselves, we ought
at least to recognize the meaning of that step. In the United States
when a major corporate executive resigns or retires there is a
mandatory process of talking calm to the markets. You don't resign
unless than two years notice, so as to give the feeling of orderly
transition and complete control over circumstances. If, for example,
the chief executive officer of the Enron corporation resigns suddenly
on no notice, then that's a sign that immense trouble is immediately
ahead as in that case bankruptcy was by six weeks.
</p>

<p>
[0h03m35s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
So for Mr. Gates to have announced that he is retiring from active service to
Microsoft on two years notice, is the minimum length of time, that could have
been chosen without sending the signal: Microsoft is in an acute short term
trouble.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It isn't &quot;My God! Everything is great, he's giving two years notice&quot;.
That's the least that could have been done.
</p>

<p class="indent">
However, this particular retirement was announced to occur approximately five
months before <i>the</i> most crucial product released in ten years. So anything that
leads you to believe that this is normal, ordinary, &quot;Mr. Gates promise Mr. Allen
and Mr. Ballmer that he would stay at Microsoft until at least
fifty, which he now is&quot; - all of that talk is irrelevant. Mr Gates last week
announced his retirement on the shortest possible timeline that wouldn't spook
the markets. A resignation announced six months before the shipment of the
most important product in ten years. I am characterising that <i>fairly</i> When I
characterise it as personal surrender.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Even better: Mr. Gates has surrendered and he's leaving the company to Mr.
Ballmer. Better news for us could not have been imagined.  So, that's where they
are.
</p>

<p>
[0h05m23s]
</p>

<p id="where-are-we">[Section: Where are we?]</p>

<p class="indent">
Where are we?
</p>

<p class="indent">
We are on schedule with the most important work we have done, in fifteen years.
Anybody who thinks that Mr. Stallman's retirement is about to be announced
wasn't here this morning. He's fifty four, Mr. gates is fifty, Mr. Gates has quit
and left the field to younger men, like Mr. Stallman.
So here we are, in the middle of the GPL3 process which, as to timing
at any rate, seems to be going on at the right moment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As you all know we released the first discussion draft in January at MIT.
We said: &quot;it's a discussion draft, we are listening carefully to
what people may want to say about it&quot; and we convened a large and, admittedly,
somewhat complicated process for listening to what people have to say.
</p>

<p>
[0h06m26s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The first thing that turned out to be on everybody's mind was that GPL version 2
was perfect. I know that it was perfect, because everything we wanted to change
they told us we shouldn't change at all. And the implication therefore was:
we have been living with an absolutely perfect licence, every single change in
which was a bad idea. I wasn't absolutely surprised about this.  Human beings have
a certain resistance to change, and I wasn't surprised that everything we
proposed changing turned out they really loved in the old version.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But it is good to know that anyway the GPL2 is perfect. So if anything goes
wrong, and we don't do GPL3, the World will still have a perfect licence with which
to work.
</p>

<p>
[0h07m10s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
I actually think, if I might dare to say so, after fifteen years of working with
it carefully that GPL2 can be improved, and we are improving it, but it's
nice to know that the world at large have come to regard it with such fondness
before we start to change it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Within a couple of weeks, after our announcement of the draft and the process for
discussing it, I began to hear rumors that we weren't really going to listen to
anybody.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Apparently we had gone to enormous amount of works to create a worldwide process
for listening to everybody solely as a sham; actually I've heard: &quot;Mr. Stallman
is going to make the decisions all by himself&quot;, every once in a while I even
heard people saying that I was going to make decision by myself, which if they
knew Mr. Stallman they wouldn't say.
</p>

<p>
[laughter]
</p>

<p class="indent">
So in any event for a little while there, it looked, I suppose, to
some people as though this whole grand effort to get everybody
else's advice and wisdom involved, was somehow just a game we were playing.
Which is, for my point of view, too bad that it's not true. If this were a game we
were playing about taking everybody's opinion seriously I could get a lot more
sleep, but unfortunately it's not that way.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We actually set up to listen to everybody as carefully as we could in a context
in which each kind of commentator would feel comfortable making his and her
kinds of comments and the commenting on behalf of their organisations. And we've
been listening extremely hard for four and half months and there's a great deal
that we have learned in the course of that time.
</p>

<p>
[0h08m46s]
</p>

<p id="the-process">[Section: The public process]</p>

<p class="indent">
I want to talk just a little bit then about that process which the world at
large has seen, but only one side of.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We made discussion committees by asking those people who joined us in
Cambridge for the launch to join into committees, organized around types of
social role in the process:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
vendors of commercial versions of Free Software or hardware that
  works with Free Software
</li>

<li>
leadership of Free Software projects that do use GPL, that don't use GPL
</li>

<li>
lawyers on behalf of large users, corporate officials working on
  behalf of corporations that are large users, public servants who are
  interested in public sector adoption
</li>

<li>
individual hackers with substantial street cred whose views might be
  influential in helping other people to consider the licence either
  as one to use or one to approve, and so on.
</li>

</ol>

<p id="how-they-talk">[Section: How the committees discuss]</p>

<p class="indent">
Those committees meet in different ways, one committee consisting entirely of
hackers prefers to work almost exclusively by IRC, one group consisting very
largely of persons employed by major vendors tends to use large conference
calls, parties use the forms of interaction which are
comfortable and convenient for them, and we attempt to provide an environment
in which everybody's comments can be heard and thought about with a sense of
equality among participants.
</p>

<p>
[0h10m23s]
</p>

<p id="comments-website">[Section: How the public comments]</p>

<p class="indent">
As Richard said, we created a little web services code that didn't exist before. We
needed an application for allowing a very large number of people to attach
comments to a single document and for the world at large to be able to see in an
intuitive way, reading the text, where the comments concentrated and what level
of intensity and how to click through there to get to other people's comments
quickly on particular areas of interest or concern.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I actually think that software did a pretty good job.  It reduced the
volume of comments, somewhat, at the cost of, or at the benefit of,
greatly increased specificity in comments, because the Stet system
made people go and highlight an area of text and say: &quot;this is what
I'm talking about and this is what I have o say&quot; the quality of
comments was very high. And the number was rendered more manageable
because people didn't file, essentially, comments spam saying, I hate
the whole thing or I love the whole thing, they actually went and
found a place where they had something to say and said it. We had
about a thousand non trivial comments from third parties not involved
in the discussion process in any way, just people who used the system
to register commentary of importance to them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In that thousand, everyone of which was reviewed by somebody working
on the process with me, with Richard, with David Turner, with Richard
Fontana. In that process of looking at every single one of those
comments I will say that at least one, maybe two or three, really
important issues were seen for the first time, by somebody
unaffiliated with our process in formal terms who simply had a damn
good point to make which needed to be taken into account.
</p>

<p>
[0h12m21s]
</p>

<p id="gold-example">[Section: An example high-value comment]</p>

<p class="indent">
Let me give you one example of an important issue unearthed in the
public comment process which will have an effect on the second
discussion draft of the licence.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As you all know, since the beginning of the licence it has concentrated a great
deal of attention on distribution as the moment at which obligations attached
to your role in the free community. The assumption has always
been that distribution is a one way activity. Somebody distributes, and the
user receives. If binaries are being distributed, in particular, the binary
distributor has an obligation to make source code available to a receiving user.
</p>

<p class="indent">
All of this make great deal of sense in 1991 and it probably still makes great
deal of sense in 2006, but.  Consider the situation of an iso image of a cd
containing binaries of Free Software material under GPL being distributed
among persons by BitTorrent. If you think about that scenario for just a
moment you will see that in the torrent are a bunch of people &quot;distributing
binaries&quot; who don't think of themselves as distributors, who think
of themselves as users receiving the binaries who have no source code and who
haven't even got all the binary, yet. So that even if source code will later be part
of the same torrent they're not guaranted to have it and they can't pass it
along.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Under GPL2, an unaffiliated commentator said to us, this would be infringing
activity, why don't you do something about that in GPL3 ? 
</p>

<p class="indent">
We looked at it and said, &quot;you know, you're right&quot;. That's a major problem. That
is to say, it's not all that hard to fix, but it's a major problem not to have
seen it, &quot;we are glad you brought it up&quot;.
</p>

<p class="indent">
And we will make a few very narrow changes in the second discussion
draft of GPL3 to allow from the fact that peer-to-peer models of
distribution may involve ancillary transmission by people who would
traditionally have been thought as were receivers and they shouldn't
have any obligations under the licence, because they are not actually
engaged, in the sense we used to mean, in 'distribution'.
</p>

<p>
[0h14m55s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
That's for example an important technical issue in the changing, use and context
of the licence, raised by somebody from outside the process and, as I said,
there are probably two or three more of equivalently important scope that I
could point to. That kind of commentary is worth its weight in gold. It is because
of that kind of commentary from unaffiliated individuals that the entire process
is worth to maintaining, cost-what-it-will, to maintain it, to read its output, to
think about every word it says, that's exactly what we were hoping for, that's
exactly what we are getting.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I have enormous respect for those people around the world, who decided to take
the time and trouble to make comments on this licence. They are doing a bang up
job. As somebody who has to think about this all day every day,
right now, I am immensely pleased that smart people would be willing voluntarily
to take some time on it, and the quality of what we have got in every way
demonstrates the power of the multiplied hive mind. We are
getting great work out of people.
</p>

<p>
[0h16m02s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Is this true of the committees? [inaudable short sentence]. Committee
members have spent dozens of hours, in some cases hundreds of hours,
working on this licence.  They have spend a lot of time communicating,
they have spent a lot of time refining ideas, they have spent lot of
time coming up with improvements or suggestions or possible changes in
language. They have been willing to do what in inter-corporate
negotiations is often hard to do, they have come out and said what
they wanted and said what they needed clearly and candidly, and I'm
very grateful to them for doing that.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It has made it possible for us to understand what it would take to
provide a licence whose users - commercial as well as non commercial -
would feel themselves protected in their rights. And that's a powerful
and important task that we set to perform and that we could not
perform without all the effort and time and thinking that has gone
into it on other people's parts.
</p>

<p>
[0h17m01s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
I believe that the first several months of discussion of the first discussion
draft have been beneficial to the quality of the draft in every way.
</p>

<p id="much-change">[Section: A lot has been rewritten]</p>

<p class="indent">
As you will see when it is released there are few articles that have not been
substantially rewritten. I am still puzzled by people's belief that we weren't
going to listen. I know that if I could release right this minute by throwing up
on the screen a strike out and bold copy of the new draft,
showing everything removed and everything inserted, that it would be harder for
people to take seriously this claim that we weren't listening. They would see
their language coming out and language going in that they would recognizes as
directly responsive to public comment and to suggestions. In a few weeks that's
what people will see, and I believe that that will allow us to enter the second
discussion period with much more confidence on the world's part
that the work that they are doing to help us to improve the licence is being
gratefully and thoughtfully received.
</p>

<p>
[0h18m15s]
</p>

<p id="internationalisation">[Section: Internationalisation]</p>

<p class="indent">
In the process of revising the licence, second discussion draft, we have done
more work on what I think of as the fundamental challenge in
internationalisation. A question was asked this morning about
translation, and translation is unquestionably one possible way of
internationalising a licence. But translation is, in my judgement, at best, at
best, a second best way of internationalising the licence, and, for the reasons
that Richard offered this morning, a somewhat dangerous way.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The best way of internationalising the licence, in my judgement, is to look as
formerly as possible to the work done more than a hundred and ten years ago in
the making of the Berne Convention. An attempt to harmonise global copyright law
in the World is now more than a hundred and ten years old. The United States was
late to come to Berne as a full participant in harmonising copyright law. That's
the good part of the thing called The Digital Millenium Copyright's Act, there
is a good part, trust me, not much but a little.
</p>

<p class="indent">
And given that we are all now existing in a Berne universe, the right way of
internationalising is to come as close to Berne Convention mechanisms as
possible. In order to do that the one step really needed is to get out of the
licence dependence on any single legal system's vocabulary or unique conceptions.
And so our effort has been to genericise the way the licence does its work.
</p>

<p id="example-decision">[Section: Example of bridging legal system differences]</p>

<p class="indent">
I'll give you an example which came up in a conversation I had with
Carlo Piana over lunch. One defect in the licence as seen in some
countries of the world under GPL2 was that GPL2 stated that it was a
perpetual licence. German speaking lawyers, for example, working in
Germany, and that's only one example, said &quot;you know, our legal system
really doesn't like that much&quot; in fact, in order to be valid licences
need to state a term. &quot;Well, alright&quot;, we said, we understand that there
are some legal systems around the world in which stating a term may be
necessary or desirable in order to make a good licence.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are also legal systems around the world, we work in one the United States,
where making licences perpetual is the right idea, because having non exclusive
licences good only for a term is an invitation to trouble.
</p>

<p class="indent">
One way you could go at this is to translate the licence so that it says one
thing in German and another thing in English, but as Mr. Stallman pointed out
this morning, that's exactly the danger.
</p>

<p>
[0h21m19s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Otherwise you appear to be put to a bad choice, choose one or
choose the other and somebody will be unhappy with you. So the goal in modifying
the licence is to do neither and still achieve the result needed by both. As you
noticed, the first discussion draft said: &quot;GPL now is a licence for a term, and
term is the length of copyright on the underlying program&quot;.
Perpetual so far as the copyright is, and no more perpetual than that, and can be
stated as a fix term reduceable to a number and any given moment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Accordingly, I hope and believe, based on the legal advice we've taken from
lawyers around the world, who are helping us with this matter, we have succeeded
in finessing a problem where we might have been thought to face
a choice, between something that would work in system one and something that would
work in in system two, but not both.  
</p>

<p>
[0h22m12s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The second discussion draft of the licence goes still further in that path. As
Richard mentioned this morning, we have once again attempted to take vocabulary
and consolidate it, so that there is a set of terms unique to GPL, all of which
can be defined by relation to underlying copyright law in each individual
copyright system.
</p>

<p id="propagation">[Section: Propagating and conveying software]</p>

<p class="indent">
So &quot;propagation&quot; is doing anything with the program that requires local permission
on the copyright law, except running it or privately modifying it. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
&quot;Conveying&quot; it, is propagating the program in a way that makes it possible for
others to make or receive copies. By using language which is not US
copyright language, or anybody else's copyright language, but by stating only
the relationship between licence terms of order and states of fact in the world,
we think we can get rid of a large number of problems arising out of national
law.
</p>

<p id="derivative">[Section: No more reliance on &quot;derivative works&quot;]</p>

<p class="indent">
I will say, therefore, the second discussion draft of GPL3 will not have any
longer any dependency on the American copyright law idea of a &quot;derivative work&quot;.
Accordingly we will be able to avoid another fifteen years of complaining from
lawyers who quite justifibly thought that reliance on a US centric view of
the derivative work was a major source of uncertainty and uneasiness. They may
think that what we have done instead is not a perfect improvement, but I feel
certain that they will at least be the recognition that it's a
useful development.
</p>

<p>
[0h23m54s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Internationalisation of the licence, as I said at the beginning, in Cambridge,
goes along with the other major structural change that we wanted to make. Which
Richard described this morning as we described it in January as enhanced
compatibility.
</p>

<p id="proliferation">[Section: Fixing licence proliferation]</p>

<p class="indent">
I want to go back over that ground a little bit for you, in order to put the
context a little more deeply around it. After Richard's discussion of enhanced
compatibility this morning, a question was asked in the question
period: &quot;what about licence proliferation?&quot;
</p>

<p class="indent">
Our answer to licence proliferation, I think, I want to expand a little bit on
Richard's remarks, is very straight forward now: use GPL, add the permissions
that you need, if the restrictions you would have put in a different licence are
restrictions compatible with GPL on the section 7, you need not make any new
licence. If you don't like copyleft we can do nothing for you, but if you don't
like copyleft then you should recognise licence proliferation as the necessary
consequence of the non-copyleft licensing you prefer to do. In other words, ask
yourselves: &quot;why has there been licence proliferation?&quot;. There has not been
proliferation of copyleft licences, or rather there has been very limited
proliferation of copyleft licences. There are two or three copyleft licences in
the world with any significant mindshare.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Permissive licences have multiplied all out of keeping. But it is
precisely because permissive licensing has as a necessary consequence the
proliferation of licences, that we are where we are.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Parties who wanted to licence in non proliferating ways had too few choices,
when there were a small number of copyleft licences and they all worked in pretty
much one way only.
</p>

<p>
[0h26m05s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
GPL's new section 7, the enhanced compatibility provision, will allow
copyleft licensing to be used more flexibly while still striking the balance in
the direction of commercial usability for businesses and clarity for individual
developers who want to know what licence to apply to their code. I think it
makes an enormous contribution if people care to use it in that way, that's up
to everybody else. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
We will have laid down an infrastructure for licence interoparation which we
believe, if used fully, will have a very substantial effect in reducing
proliferation over the next few years.
</p>

<p id="lgpl">[Section: LGPL, like merging electronic weak]</p>

<p class="indent">
Some comment was made this morning about the LGPL as a section 7 additional
permission on top of GPL. I would have left that subject to be disclosed when we
show you the drafts in a couple of weeks, but as the subject has come up, let me
just say one little thing about it. That move does not change the behaviour of
LGPL at all, as Richard told you this morning. We adopted a non functional
change constraint in the reshaping of the licence. What it does is to allow LGPL
to serve as a good example of the additional permissions structure for GPL and
how powerful it is. By expressing LGPL as just an additional permission on top
of GPL we simplify our licensing landscape drastically.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It's like for physics getting rid of a force, right? We just unified
electro-weak, ok?  The grand unified field theory still escapes us
until the document licences too are just additional permissions on top
of GPL. I don't know how we'll ever get there, that's gravity, it's
really hard. But the physics has gotten simpler and, I think, that
alone is valuable.  The other thing is that the new LGPL expressed as
permission will show people how to use permissions to make quite
sophisticated licences very simply, and we think that also is all to
the good because such licences do not proliferate, they reconvert to
GPL at the instance of modifiers which is a valuable and useful
property to have.
</p>

<p>
[0h28m43s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
That's all I wanted to say about the technical material in the licence, except
to talk about &quot;issues&quot;. As we said at the outset there are two or
three dominant issues that remain to be talked out in order to get to a
consensus about the licence.
</p>

<p class="indent">
One issue, or one group of issues has to do with the handling of patent rights.
The other issue has to do with the control over software in the interest of
entertainment security. I want to talk very briefly about both of those because
Richard talked at length and I don't want to redo anything he said. So
I'm gonna try to add only, and in questions you will take up what you think I
have been too light on.
</p>

<p id="patents">[Section: The patents issue]</p>

<p class="indent">
With respect to patents, the issue has changed radically in the last
couple of years. GPL version 2 is a licence that says: &quot;There's a
terrible patent problem, if you don't do something about it, all hell
is going to break loose sooner or later&quot;.  'Sooner or later' has come
and gone and everybody knows that all hell has broken loose.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The fundamental question now for everybody is how to invent around
the patent system, through the licence, so as to achieve optimum goals
for several different classes of parties. Parties who have large
patents protfolios and want to contribute to the Free Software world
and GPL in particular, parties who are afraid of other people's
patents because they make revenues that could be the source of claims
for royalties, and parties who want to develop software and are afraid
of patents, not because they have commercial and significant revenues
streams, but because they are afraid of the chilling effect of
announcements of patents or patent licences or patent lawsuits as a
way of politically inhibiting people from making desirable Free
Software.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Those are quite distinct groups, some parties, that is parties with large patents
portfolios also having significant revenue streams, appear more than once in the
interest group analysis of the patent problems. Each of those
major industrial parties with large patent portfolios has well developed patent
policies of its own and well developed positions in negotiations with other
parties in the industry concerning its patent portfolios. We, although we have a
certain sophistication in those conversations, having sat in them for years,
have no patents and no clout in that world, usually.
</p>

<p>
[0h31m39s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Right now we have some clout, because we make a licence people need. But we
cannot overuse that clout, we must make a licence that people need as much as they
need the one we are changing.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The discussion about patents has been very complicated, very thick, sometimes
rather heated, though those parties who have tried to apply fire
to the soles of my feet have been kind enough to do it privately instead of
publicly, still there has been a great deal of attempted torture.
I have responded as gently as I possibly could but sometimes I have
said harsh words back, too, for which I am now publicly stating that I don't
regret it at all. Bargaining is bargaining; we will be done soon.
</p>

<p>
[0h32m29s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
I believe that great progress has been made among the patent holders
in understanding what they need, what they need collectively, as well
as individually and what represent good outcomes from the Free
Software Foundation position in this matter. We have considered a
number of changes to the statements contained in the first discussion
draft about patents, we have listened exceedingly carefully to
everybody who had anything to say on that subject, whether they were
patent holders or not, and we think we have proposals to make, in the
near future, that will be very helpful in resolving these issues. Once
those issues are resolved we need movement on other questions too.

<p id="drm">[Section: The DRM issue - it's all about software]</p>

<p class="indent">
Which brings us to the subject of Richard's major address this
morning, the problem of Digital Restrictions over code.
</p>

<p class="indent">
People have tended to think of this as though Richard was trying to
cram down their throat a replacement word for what they were doing. Companies
that make entertainment content, think they have digital rights, and that they
should be allowed to manage their digital rights. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
I have no stake in that, in one way or another, as private citizen I have real
strong feelings about that. But my role right now is to be a lawyer for the Free
Software movement, and as a lawyer for the Free Software movement I have nothing
to do with music and nothing to do with movies. I don't represent the Free Music
Foundation and I don't represent the Free Movie Foundation. I represent people
care about making Free Software, and for them Mr. Stallman is quite right. What
are Digital Res...What are Digital Rights Management issues to the entertainment
companies are simply Restrictions Management to us.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Because what is restricted is the right to make our software the way we make
our software. That restriction is set to follow from somebody's use of
own rights over his own copyrighted works, music and movies, but
that means nothing to us. Not because we think there shouldn't be copyright on
music or movies or because we think sharing should be free, whatever it is.
That's all irrelevant.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You will hear a lot of talk about DRM in which it is suggested that we are
somehow trying to use a software licence to address non software issues. Nothing
could be further from the truth: we are addressing a software issue. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
Is GPL software being distributed in a way which would be illegal, if
the licence were being evaded, and which is solely regarded as legal
because the licence evasion is technically implemented.
</p>

<p>
[0h35m20s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
If I sell you a computer containing software under GPL, let's say I make a
digital video recorder, let's say I call it TiVo. And I sell it to you and I
say: &quot;there's a GPL software in here, here is the source code. The only thing
is, if you modify this software inside my box I will cut your service off&quot;. That
will be a straightforward violation of GPL. You would be adding a
condition to the licence and you couldn't do it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Now why it's such a big deal, that everybody should jump up and down and yell
and scream and carry on if we say: &quot;oh! and by the way, what you are not allowed
to do by illegally modifying the licence, you are not allowed to do by modifying
the hardware so that the licence can be evaded safely!&quot;. It's a straightforward
proposition: you can't do it this way and you can't do it that way either, why
are you trying to evade the licence?
</p>

<p class="indent">
&quot;Well we are very concerned about copyright on music and movies&quot; -
Don't give me that. That's like any other reason for evading the
licence. &quot;Well, we're very interested in making money Mr. Stallman, and
if we break your licence we can make more money!&quot; - Sorry that's not a
reason.
</p>

<p class="indent">
So what we are talking about is not something about why we are mad at Hollywood
or why we are mad at music factories, that's another discussion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We are saying that the licence should prohibit technical means of evasion of its
rules, with the same clarity that it prohibits legal evasion of its rules,
that's all. 
</p>

<p>
[0h36m56s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
On that subject we do not believe that there is a lot of room for
principled argument going the other way, but such room as there is we
are open to listening to.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Richard emphasised today that if this attempt to inhibit evasion of the licence
came in the form of the refusal to permit use, it would be wrong to do. Some of
the language we published in January lead people to conclude we were imposing
use restrictions in order to deal with a mode of evasion of the licence by
people seeking security for entertainment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To the extent that that language caused to people to feel that that's what we
were doing, it was plainly badly chosen language and it will
be replaced in GPL3's second discussion draft.
</p>

<p>
[0h37m59s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Richard also said this morning that we have been working against the
background of a moving target in Europe.  As European domestic
implementations of EUCD threw up new legal restrictions that we might
have to confront and deal with.
</p>

<p class="indent">
At the present moment we believe that the next draft will contain
language succesfully repelling the force of both of US DMCA and the
EUCD, without employing use restrictions or other inappropriate
technology within the context of the licence. We are continuing to
work with lawyers around the world to see to it that the final draft
will also act to get in the way of anti-circumvention law written
elsewhere in the world using other legal concepts.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The goal is to make it possible for people who get GPL'd software to
exercise the rights promised to them by the licence.
</p>

<p>
[0h39m04s]
</p>

<p>
Audience member: Excuse me Mr. Moglen would you like speaking slower
so that...
</p>

<p class="indent">
Moglen: Sure, I apologize.  I also apologize for using English. I
appreciate that is may be difficult for some people.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To go back over that point, I wanted to say that we will use, as best
we can, other legal advice we have taken to ensure that the final
version of the licence, works against other anti-circumvention law
around the world not merely EUCD and US DMCA statutes but other legal
regulations elsewhere in the world as well.
</p>

</p>

<p id="afterward">[Section: What happens after the process]</p>

<p class="indent">
I want to wrap up and take questions for the rest of the time, I suspect there are
lot of questions. Let me just say something, because for me this is the half way
point in a long process, let me say something about what will happen when it's
over. You may be less concerned about that than I am, half way through this process
I am very eager to think about the day when it will be over.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When it will be over, I believe, probably some time next January, we will have
made, by international collaboration, the rules that govern a system of
intellectual creativity, also the rules that govern a multi billion dollar
industry, also the constitution of a social and political movement called the
Free Software movement. We will have adjusted the language of all three
documents inside one piece of paper. The rules that allow individuals and
students and classes and schools around the world to experiment freely with all
forms of computer knowledge. The rules which allow multi billion dollar
businesses to operate in stable and unified ways. At the time when the leading
alternate model of how to make and distribute software is visibly bankrupt and
incapable of performing.
</p>

<p class="indent">
And we will have made clear what the constitution of the Free Software movement
is, for the next little while, by stating what its goals are and how it
proposes to achieve them.
</p>

<p>
[0h42m01s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
We will all have done all these things, tens of thousands of people around the
world will have collaborated to do those three things, this year.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The largest, most deeply funded monopoly in the history of the world,
will have lost its CEO, fired a bunch of its subordinate executives,
and produced, instead of the best release in ten years, a total
commercial and technical failure.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Proprietary software will have visibly collapsed, cut off at the knees by its
own inefficiency.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We, you and I and everybody else doing this, will have succeeded in negotiating
the rules of the industry for the next decade by open collaboration.
</p>

<p class="indent">
At the end of that process, politics and government and society and economics
will notice that discrepancy. They will notice that discrepancy because the
sound of the failure of Microsoft will be much quieter than you think, the sound
of the failure of Microsoft will concentrate a lot of other people's attention
because Microsoft won't be speaking so loudly anymore.
</p>

<p class="indent">
At the contrary, people will be saying to themselves: &quot;They used to have a
billion dollars a month in profit! And they used to spend that billion dollars a
month making propaganda about how their way was the only right way. Funny how
they don't have that profit anymore. Funny how they can spend all that dough
on propaganda anymore. Funny how much simpler it seems now, when they're not
yammering so loudly. By God! Now we can hear ourselves think. And in the middle
of this quiet we notice that there's was a bad way of doing business&quot;.
</p>

<p class="indent">
That's where we are going to be when this is over. We are going to have renewed
our fundamental infrastructure and made it much stronger and much more flexible.
The world's leading alternative approach will have died on the field of battle
chosen by itself, having failed to make its own products well enough to convince
the users, it had already trapped, to use them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
That's going to be quite a shocking comparison to those who don't know what we
were up to as clearly as we did.
</p>

[45m 00s]
</p>

<p id="q1-permissions-and-restrictions">
Q1: I'd like to ask you to explain further about the difference between added
restrictions and added permissions, which, at least to me, has been a little
unclear in the explanation of Mr. Stallman, and yours was a bit cursory,
especially as it amounts to patents. Added permissions, as &quot;you can use patents
in our portfolio&quot;, added restrictions, as &quot;you can't use, or 'disseminate' is
the word, our software if you initiate a lawsuit&quot;.
</p>

<p>
The second questions is if you talked to people like the Debian
project, who are seemingly even stricter than the Free Software
Foundation in some of the requisites for what they call freedom in
licenses.
</p>

<p>
It's a bit of a long question, with three parts, I realise.
</p>

<p>
[45m 50s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
A: Yeah, they're actually quite different, let me try to take them as different
questions, I'll speak to them differently as quickly as I can.
</p>

<p class="indent">
First, I thought that one of the disadvantages of the way section 7 was released
in the first discussion draft, was that it attempted to treat permissions and
requirements together, in one unified set of drafting. I had an alternate
drafting proposal, which treated permissions as one sub-subject, and
requirements as another; and in the second discussion draft we adopt that
drafting instead. The consequence is to make the differences among permissions
and requirements easier to understand and to follow.
</p>

<p>
[46:40]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Rather than talk my way through language that we'll have out on the
street in a bit, let me just put it in the narrowest way. Permissions
are an essentially open set, you can permit pretty much anything you
want in addition to the GPL, but permissions are removable. Additional
requirements must be one of a specific set of possible additional
requirements; the set is closed, not open. Those requirements are not
removable from the code which bears those requirements, instead you
have to point each recipient of the code clearly to which additional
requirements apply to which portions of the code. So if you adopt
something out an Apache licensed program, there is a patent
retaliation clause in the Apache license, therefore you have some code
in your GPL program which has a patent retaliation provision applying
to it, and you have to indicate clearly to the user what code that is.
</p>

<p class="indent">
That's the nature of the difference between permissions and requirements.  You
asked specifically about the use of the additional permissions section to deal
with patents: we don't rely upon the additional permissions section to deal with
patent rights. Whatever is going to be said about how patent rights are
allocated between people making, people distributing, and people using the code,
will be said in the base GPL, in section 11; and how it is set will be carefully
determined after discussion with all those people in the world who care about
that, but there we're looking for a unique consensus solution.
</p>

<p>
[48m 30s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
[interruption from the audience]
</p>

<p class="indent">
With respect to permissions, grants of patent allocations, non
assertion of patents, whatever it is that is the technical material,
the way you know that you get what you need to practice the freedoms
in the licence, will not be as a result of the additional terms.  That
will be in the base terms.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Patent retaliation clauses, however, go in that category of additional
requirements sometimes permitted, and there the principle was stated in the
first discussion draft of the license: patent retaliation clauses are OK if they
are fully defensive in character; if their purpose is solely to repel patent
lawsuits, and not to take other kinds of advantages using patents. The GPL will
not contain any such clause; it will merely say it's compatible with licenses
containing such clause.
</p>

<p class="indent">
So, to pick up your last question, there will be no issue with Debian:
if a license out there in the world is also a free license under the
Debian Free Software Guidelines, then that license, to the extent GPL
permits, may be compatible with GPL, but the freedom or unfreedom of
that license can be judged by looking at that license standing alone
under DFSG; no license becomes GPL-compatible, which isn't also
capable of being compatible with Debian Free Software Guidelines, and
we won't be saying &quot;License X is compatible with the GPL&quot;, we'll be
saying &quot;Here's a term; GPL can use that term; if GPL accepts code
under that term, that term stays on that code, not under GPL, but
under the other requirements set applicable to that code.  Use all the
code under the GPL, if you take that piece out, remember to
pass it along with the patent retaliation clause on it&quot;. That's all.

<p class="indent">
Well, I haven't any reason to suspect that there will be an incompatibility; I
haven't any reason to believe that there is a chance of an incompatibility; it
hasn't been my primary concern, because it hasn't seemed to me to be even the
beginning of an issue; if it were suggested somewhere along the way by our own
evaluation, or by somebody else's, that there was a real problem with the Debian
Free Software Guidelines we would address it.

<p id="q3-dmca-wordings">
Q3: I have another question concerning the DRM clause. There is one wording that

sense of the DCMA. Do you expect this clause to be effective?
</p>

<p>
[51m 45s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
I expect that US courts will be instructed on the intention of the licensor
to reject the features of DMCA as it applies to GPL software. I expect the
United States courts to listen closely to statements of the licensor's intent,
because under US copyright law it is the licensor's intent which normatively
determines the content of licene.
</p>

<p class="indent">
That language was not meant to deal with EUCD arrangements, which are different;
we will employ a different strategy for dealing with the EUCD, which is not
present in discussion draft 1, and which will see its first public exposure in
discussion draft 2, at which point we will then begin discussing with European
lawyers, businesses and parties, what they think of that proposal.

Yeah, the question was asked offline whether I would now disclose what

might I point out that there are two countries presently implementing EUCD right
under our noses, and I reserve the right to make further changes in light of
those legal changes if I need to in the next several weeks. The reasons for not
pre-disclosing things is that I have an obligation of professional caution, and
my client as you know has a very deep belief in the importance of avoiding
mistakes that could permanently harmful to freedom. If this were the right date
to disclose those terms, we'd disclose those terms today.

Q5: On the DRM front, is the invasion of privacy wording one of the one wordings
that's going to be removed from this draft?
</p>

<p>
[53m 55s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Yeah, I expect that language to be gone; I've said that in public on several
locations. I thought myself as one lawyer that there was a useful role to play in
the license for principles that would have given private copyright holders
around the world a legal weapon with which to deal with spyware problems.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I think those problems are terribly severe.  I expect most governments to get it
wrong and keep it wrong, because their incentives are misaligned: the victims of
spyware are individual citizens; the beneficiaries of spyware are wealthy public
and private parties with enormous benefits to gain from the continuance of low
security; as Microsoft fails, and the primary provider of low network security
around the world begins to fail; the parties which have benefitted from ten
years of low network security, and boy have they benefitted!, will begin to look
for other ways to insure low network security.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The monopoly was an extraordinarily good way to achieve low network security,
because the only party who had to take the blame, was the party to whom there
was no alternative, and which was perfectly happy to have its non-existent
reputation for integrity blacken still further. Once that is no longer true, the
problem of how to achieve high network security given many commercial parties'
desire for weak network security will grow more intense.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I thought it was desireable to afford individual developers the
opportunity as private attorneys general around the world to use
copyright law to inhibit bad practices built into their code by
subsequent modifiers. I now conclude that that's a provision for
which, by large, the community does not see it in that way, and it is
not hard to remove it, given the absence of people's interest in
it. Later I believe they will wish we had done that, probably in the
same intensity that they would wish that we had solved the patent more
coercively in 1991, and may very well be glad that we have solved the
DRM problems for them to the extent that we are going to solve them
this year. But we will leave that problem to be dealt with by the
future, because it's clear that the readers of the license in the
present don't see its value, and do see significant drawbacks, so I
believe that it will come out.

</p>

<p>
[57m 00s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
You can always use an additional permission, to combine GPL'd code with any
other license that you want. So in that sense, yes, you can use additional
permissions to make trivial compatibility between GPL and other licenses. Please
remember that permissions are removable: downstream from you, parties may
decide to remove your trivial compatibility provision, thus returning the code
under the license to a pure GPL state. Remember that existing LGPL contains a
provision that says all code licensed under LGPL can always be relicensed under
GPL. So in turning LGPL into an additional permission, we are not changing any
behaviour by making it a removable permission on top of GPL. If you used a
similar approach to make compatibility with another license, and admitted the
removability, you would be fine.

<p id="q7-a-contract">
Q7: How are you thinking about changing something in the title of the

that's a bit incompatible with the laws in some place, like in Brazil
- I'm from Brazil.
</p>

<p>
[58m 23s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
I firmly disagree with that position, but nonetheless we will do something to
meet these needs. I ultimately regard these believes as narrow-minded and
foolish, it belongs to half a dozen law professors around the world, each of
whom should check his cards again, and it's all &quot;he&quot;. They are people with gray
hair and old minds. They're not very old minds, because if in each of their
legal systems they went to their old legal dictionaries and looked at what the
word license means, or if they got real Roman about it and went and looked in the
Institutes of Justinian to find out what license means, they would discover that
a license is a unilateral permission, not an obligation, and so what happens is
that these minds that say these thing, they're stuck in a little space, a
thousand years after Justinian and before the Second World War.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Nonetheless, there's a view, OK? And so that view, which has been hardly
repeated, deservers to be regarded with respect, though I haven't given it any
respect in my personal comments, because I'm entitled to a personal opinion.
As a working drafting lawyer, I expect that section 9 will bear, when it is
released, a title something like &quot;acceptance not required to receive and run
copies&quot;, which is a statement of fact, accurate and clear, and which reduces the
reliance upon a legal characterisation, increasing reliance on a factual
consideration, which is in general the course we have taken with respect to
de-nationalising the license.
</p>

<p class="indent">
So much as I believe as one working lawyer that it is a foolish legal position,
I recognise that it is a straightforward request that can be served and that
should be dealt with, and we will deal with it.

[60m 40s]
</p>

<p id="q8-asp-loophole">
Q8: I have two questions. First, do you have anything to say about the
so called &quot;ASP loophole&quot;, or &quot;web loophole&quot;
because in the morning RIchard said that he saw the possibility to
adopt some clauses from the Affero GPL to fix this problem, but it may
be too drastic for GPLv3, but I think this loophole can be very
dangerous.  Some day, our friend Microsoft will be gone, but we might
have the next enemy, because now we have the so called &quot;Web 2.0
companies&quot; whose business model is basically built on web
services. Would you answer this question first?
</p>

<p>
[61m 40s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Knowing, as I do, that you may very well wind up not getting your second question in,
but that's all right. Look, here's the situation as I think we know see it:
there are two ethical points of view about what should happen when you take
somebody else's code which they wrote to interact with users over a network,
modify it yourself, and go into business competing with them to serve the same
people using your modified version of their code: one ethical position is &quot;you
should be required to give your changes back to the world: you're competing with
others in the public provision of services based on that code, and you should
return to commons your modifications, the same as if you were selling or
distributing that code&quot;, that's one ethical point of view.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The other ethical point of view is that this is a uniquely distinctive situation
in which any attempt to interfere with the right to keep those subsequent
modifications private, interferes with the right of private execution and private
modification, rights that are not to be tampered with. Those ethical points of
view are both very strong. THere is no benefit whatever to the license  maker,
or to the free software world in general, in choosing between those ethical
theories for everybody else. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
If we came to you and we said &quot;we thought about these hard ethical issue; there
are absolutely good and absolutely clear arguments on both sides, they are of
equal weight and importance, this decision will have billions of dollars effect
in the world, we've decided it this way, A way or B&quot; people would rightly say
&quot;what had you in your world, that justified you with making that
decision for everybody else&quot;.
</p>

<p>
[63m 50s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
We will not make that decision for everybody. Nor will we make parties who want
to adopt either ethical theory forego all use of existing GPL code.  Imagine for
a moment that we took out of section 7 the portion that relates to the so called
Affero GPL clause, we dropped it from the license: now anybody who wanted to,
could make a new license containing that provision, but it would be
GPL-incompatible, and they could not use any of the world's existing GPL'd
programs as a basis for building on.
</p>

<p class="indent">
That would inevitably harm innovation, because it would deprive people of all
this shareable software. On the other hand, if we decided that every GPL
included the Affero clause, there would, as you point out, be an awful lot of
businesses in the world that would lose their right to use GPL'd code, because
for reasons that they consider good and sufficient for themselves, they do not
wish to make their private modifications, which convey business advantages to
them in public facing systems, open to everybody else; they want to keep some
source code that they have modified, even though they are using that source code
to relate to the public.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Very well, we say; we would simply allow an additional requirement to be placed
on some code; if you build an Affero GPL model system, that is one which
implements services over a network, deals with the public over that network, and
in which any competitor who wants to use your code to build similar services
must release their modifications, the best way of doing that is to build your
whole application under GPL, take the part which does remote network services,
which may be just one among many modes or models of interaction for that
program, put that piece under Affero GPL, or add the requirement, is how we
would say it, and add to that program a feature which allows the user to
download the server side source.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Once you've taken all those steps, your application can be made of any GPL'd
parts yours or other people's; the particular part that you wrote to communicate
with the user over the network bears some additional requirements. Anybody who
wants to take the whole rest of your application can do so and use it in any way
they want, including private modifications and public uses.
</p>

<p class="indent">
And, if they don't like the part that you wrote being under Affero GPL, they can
rewrite it from scratch, thus minimising the amount of re-implementation
necessary, in order to take your application, which was Affero-lised, and
de-Affero-lise it so it can be used for private services. After lengthy analysis
we have concluded that this results in the optimum level of overall innovation
and the minimum level of required re-implementation, so that every developer can
get the result that every developer, or that developer's business, wants to get.
I do not think that there is another solution available which reduces the amount
of required re-implementation or which increases the net total of innovation,
therefore I think this is the right system to apply.

Q8b: But we take a very firm attitude toward DRM, right?  And I think,
from a user's view, if we can use the software, I mean the service,
and we can get the results, but we can't see the source code, it
should be called proprietary, and it may infringe our the third
freedom, to help the community.  So, maybe I'm too dogmatic but...
</p>

<p>
[68m 10s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
I don't understand how you are loosing any rights. If you write the thing
yourself, nobody else's code is involved and you can make all the rules that you
want. If you use other people's GPL'd code to make an application with, how does
it harm your rights to say you have to respect your users at the same level that
they respected you as a user when they gave you the code.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We're not in the business of preventing anybody from doing anything that he
wants with something he writes himself. The question is: if you get stuff from
somebody else which constitutes an entire application for public facing
services, and if he has written his application so that he wants mods released
back into commons, why should you think that you have a right to deprive him of
that, and still use his code?
</p>

<p class="indent">
My notion would be: if you want to re-implement the part of his code which uses
network services and leave the whole rest of it in place, you get a great deal
of benefit, you get to use 90% of his code; he gets a benefit: you are required
to respect the user's rights for that 90% to the same extent that he respects
the user's rights. If he respects the user's rights a little more in the
remaining 10% than you wanted to respect them, you have a choice: swallow hard
and take his approach to your users, or throw away that piece of his code and
re-implement. That's the minimum size re-implementation for you to have the same
absolute freedom that you want to have; I don't think you're disadvantaged, I
think you are advantaged to the extent of the continued shareability of the code
between two fundamentally ethical positions.

<p id="q9-quasi-official-translation">
Q9: If it's OK, I'd like to ask a second question, about the
translation. You said that translation are second best, and I think I
agree, more or less, but I'm from Japan, where most people, even those
who can speak English prefer to read the Japanese translation of the
licenses. I understand the idea of official translations may be very
dangerous, but I think that it would be a good idea to make
quasi-official translation, which means, it's reviewed by several
local lawyers, Japanese translations by Japanese lawyers, Spanish
translations by Spanish lawyers, and at least FSF acknowledge that
this review has happened.
</p>

<p>
[71m 00s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
I've two things to say about that. The first is that, as Mr. Stallman
indicated today, the question of translation is open for discussion, and I am
listening to everybody about it. The second thing I want to say is that I made a
trip to Tokyo before the beginning of the GPLv3 process, to meet with members of
&quot;Meek&quot; and &quot;Makey&quot;, and to meet with lawyers from all the major industrial
organisations using GPL in Japan, they were all very gracious with their time.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I said: we're going to make GPLv3, we badly need Japanese lawyers who understand
this business and its concerns to help us think about every single word in the
GPL from a Japanese legal perspective; I want to work with the best Japanese
lawyers you all identify to make this a better licence; they all said &quot;Thank you
very much, we'd be delighted to do that&quot;, and they did nothing. And the reason
they did nothing was they did not want to expose their lawyers for
non-privileged conversation on these questions.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The result is that 12 months after that meeting, which occurred in
June of 2005 in Japan, I have so far had zero meaningful legal
assistance from the lawyers working for large Japanese industry. If
it's important, it's important. If it's important later, it's
important now. If it would be good to have them make an official
translation later, then it would be good to have the same lawyers
involved right now helping us to make a better licence.
</p>

<p>
 [72m 30s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Every single large industrial organisation in Japan has highly talented lawyers
thinking hard about these questions, and they speak English quite well, as I
know from having done business with them for years.  The problem we are having
is not a language problem, the problem we are having is not a willingness to
listen problem, the problem we are having is not a &quot;we don't care about Japan&quot;
problem, the problem we are having is the parties have decided to wait and keep
silent too long.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I wish they wouldn't. I think the most useful contribution you could make would
be to put heat on the organisations to bring their people in and start
negotiating. It's now more than ready to start happening, we're halfway through
the process; if my good friends in Japan wait until the eleventh hour plus
thirty minutes to come and tell us what they think and what they want, they're
going to be disappointed; not because I'm not going to listen, but because the
train will have left the station. Please help them to get on board.
</p>

<p>
Q9b: That's what I'm doing now, I actually agree.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I'm responding to the suggestion that the way we should let them
participate now is by letting them translate it when it's over. And I
have said &quot;Gee, that's too bad. That's not a good way. Let's do it
now!&quot;.

<p id="q10-ms-demise-visible">
Q10: You opened and closed your talk, talking about Microsoft
capitulation. As someone who has constantly to deal with Microsoft
meddling with governments and blocking initiatives by sheer amounts of
money power, and stuff like that, I'm more than keen to believe that
it is such, and it would be really, a great help for us not have to
constantly fight that; however, from being exposed to that kind of
thing too often, I'm not very inclined to be so optimistic as to it
going to stop anytime soon. What should we be looking for in the near
future as further indications of this capitulation actually being a
fact?
</p>

<p>
[75m 25s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Well, there used to be a Microsoft executive, who was the
executive vice president for platform technology, whose primary task
was to &quot;beat Linux&quot;, as they described it.  His name is Martin Taylor
and everywhere he went, Martin Taylor was a very important part of the
landscape of pressure and interaction that you have described.
</p>

<p class="indent">
After the second great [inaudible] when Windows would only be a little
late, Mr Taylor was moved to work on Windows Live,
of which he became the dominant executive.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Earlier this week, suddenly, without any pre-announcement of any kind
Microsoft fired him.  Mr. Taylor has worked at Microsoft since the age
of 23, he's now 36; he was personally a pet of Mr. Ballmer's; he has a
great deal of Microsoft stock and no job; I don't know whether you
would consider that a straw in the wind or not.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I would say this: among the reasons I wanted to do this work now, one of the
reasons we identified when we started to pick this year to do GPLv3 was that I
believed that Microsoft would be busy doing something else.  Their position in
our process, their power to disrupt, was a significant concern to me from the
beginning, when a company is trying to ship a major product of its own, of a
kind that demands months and months of careful marketing and preparation, PRs as
well as merchandising, it is not likely that they will spend a lot of money
saying aggressive bad things about a third party.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It's not known to be a good way to get your own product to market, to spend a
lot of time bad-mouthing other people. So I thought this would be the best possible
year to do this work, simply because Longhorn, now Vista, had to be released
this year.
</p>

<p>
[77m 25s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
I now believe that it runs a little deeper than that; the charm offensive
Microsoft is currently conducting, which is palpable to any of us who work in
this part of the world, the charm offensive Microsoft is conducting is now
edgier than it used to be for them, there are fewer alternate options.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Of course I don't want anybody to come off alert; I'm a lawyer around here, my
job is anticipating war and being ready to fight it whenever it turns up. We
have by no means stopped worrying about aggression. When Samba 4 is released,
Microsoft will have the best reason for aggression it has had in a long time,
because it will be competing against something that doesn't just ruin the server
business for them, it eliminates the server business from them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The consequences are not going to be small for a company which already has
nothing to offer on the server side, and which has never successfully sold the
client side of anything to global enterprise without a server side to go
along. That's why the current situation is so dire in business terms for
Microsoft; that means that they will be, when they act aggressively, if they act
aggressively, acting aggressively from much greater weakness that they had in
the past.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Moreover, thanks to Carlo and others in this room and around this room,
Microsoft is far more constrained by the European Commission anti-trust
proceedings than Microsoft was ever restrained by any anti-trust proceedings
anywhere else in the World. For the first time, the company faces the
possibility of significant alterations to its behaviour mandated within the
lifetime of one of its products.
</p>

<p class="indent">
And Vista, a product they are not going to be able to sell to knowledgeable
consumers, is also in the pipeline at just the moment when it can be decisively
affected by regulatory orders from the European Commission, and Carlo and our
colleagues in that litigation have already shown that they know exactly how to
testify, and exactly what to ask for, and exactly to hold on to the ankle
without letting go.
</p>

<p>
[79m 35s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
I'm not here to tell you that this is going to be easy or simple, or that the US
embassy is never going to be asked again to do a favour for Microsoft in some
country in the World where the US embassy's word is terribly important. All of
those things may very well happen. Our general ability to return fire is
superior to at anytime in the past; our ability to do real strategic damage to
their earning capacity is stronger than at anytime in the past; our allies more
firmly believe in the possibility of beating them than at anytime in the past,
and in Google they face an adversary of whom they are terrified.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Google is from our point of view just a large user of our stuff, but from their
point of view Google is the business that terrifies them; and therefore, they
are now dividing their anxiety again for the first time in years. After Mr Gates
figured out that we were the problem, we were for a long period of time his
primary anxiety; now, it doesn't matter what makes him anxious in the middle of
the night, he's just a philanthropist. As for Mr. Ballmer, what makes him anxious in
the middle of the night? Lots of things make Mr. Ballmer anxious in the middle
of the night; we're going to keep pumping up his blood pressure until maximum is
reached, very soon.

<p id="q11-patent-retaliation-freedom">
Q11: This is a very basic legal question, I am not a lawyer...
</p>

<p class="indent">
In this country I'm not a lawyer either...
</p>

<p>
[laughter]
</p>

<p>
Q11b: I'm an eager reader of Debian Legal, which may be a bad thing, but I'd like
you to comment, as regards to the GPLv3, on what's called in Debian &quot;the
dictator test&quot;, or the tests that regard something that is not distribution or
dissemination, as would be for instance the patent retaliation clauses. I don't
completely understand about how these things can be free, which are really
restrictions of freedoms that the person would normally have and do not affect
pure redistribution; one is patent retaliation, the freedom to sue is one that
one has, supposedly, and the other one is the Affero type of thing; Affero
affects use, or liberty/freedom 0, not distribution or dissemination which would
be freedom 1, as far as I understand. Maybe you could comment on that and why
the GPLv3 takes the view that it takes on those two issues.
</p>

<p>
[82m 20s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Look, there are two aspects of that question, one of which i think is, as you
say, the Debian Legal way of life. I try not to interact with the Debian Legal
way of life, but having just said I'm not a lawyer in this country, I suppose
there is a reason that in this country I might interact with the Debian Legal
way of being a little more; I'll try and pretend that I don't know anything
about law anywhere in the World and then I'll try and think Debian Legal's way
about the stuff.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It generally turns out, as I know from having spent almost a quarter of a
century now as a lawyer for hackers, that when hackers pretend to be lawyers,
there are certain predictable formulations that they come to; they assume a
degree of consistence in legal rules that is not achievable; this is a primary
problem which occurs particularly in US focused conversation, such is that in
Debian Legal, where the libertarian demand for intellectual consistency, and the
hacker belief that laws are form of code that are executed without errors or
ambiguities, joins together to create a particular frame of analysis for legal
questions. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
It doesn't work very well for me as a lawyer, I think it doesn't work very well
for lawyers elsewhere in the World, because the one thing which lawyers around
the world all share is an awareness of the squishiness of law, it is by no means
the hard arthropod carapace for internal soft organs that non-lawyers have a
tendency to assume it is.
</p>

<p>
[84:00]
</p>

<p class="indent">
With that in mind, the problem of the patent retaliation clauses is not a
problem in the GPL, for Debian or anybody else. If the Debian legal group had
decided that the Apache Software License was a non-free license because it had a
defensive patent retaliation clause in it some years ago, maybe the Apache tribe
would have decided not to put such a clause in its licence. We are merely saying
we are prepared to coexist with it, and since the Apache license is already a
free license, from Debian's point of you, I fail to see how coexisting with
what's already free could be a freedom problem.
</p>

<p>
[84m 35s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
So far as the Affero GPL clause is concerned, remember that what it says is: &quot;if
you get a GPL'd program, that has a facility in it, giving server side source
code to the user, that's not a removable facility&quot;. That's the same statement
that the GPL makes about interactive display of copyright notices; lots of
licences in the world graded free say &quot;if the program displays copyright notice
when it starts running in the form you get it, then you have to leave that
there&quot;, and the reason is for security of attribution, right?
</p>

<p class="indent">
So here is another non removable element in a free program, placed there out of
the desire to protect people's freedom. I don't know how the Debian Legal World
will think about that, I know how the Free Software Foundation will think about
that; the Free Software Foundation would say: the very fundament of copyleft is
the desire to limit freedom minimally in order to protect freedom in the long
run. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
The question to be asked within the Free Software Foundation's ethics
of law is not &quot;Is this a restriction on freedom?&quot;, which is what I
think I heard the Debian Legal analysis is doing, the question is: &quot;If
this is a restriction of freedom, is this the narrowest possible
restriction to protect freedom in the long run, or is there a narrower
way to accomplish the same protection of freedom, or is it better to
allow freedom to be defeated in the long run than to impose this
restriction now?&quot;.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But it is always, I think, in Free Software Foundation thought, it is
certainly characteristic of Mr. Stallman's thought throughout his
career, it is characteristic, I think, to be minimalist about
restriction, not negative about restriction.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The position being taken is &quot;to have a community requires some minimun
restrictions to preserve community&quot;. We tend to see the other side's
view of that question &quot;there ought to be no restriction except those
which are inevitable&quot; as too libertarian to be firmly communal.  If
you want to keep a community in being you may have to say &quot;clean up
after your dog on the sidewalk&quot;. Yeah, it's a restriction on use, but
it's an alternative to having a lot of dog shit on the sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
[87m 10s]
</p>

<p id="q12-contract-theory">
Q12: Just a small speculation. You said that the license is a unilateral
permission. Why is that so hard for most law professors to understand? I agree
with it, but I just don't understand why very few would like to argue
in that direction.
</p>

<p>
[87m 25s]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Because in the course of the 20th century, post Edison, the copyright licence
became a device for getting more out of the customer than copyright allowed.
Once the Edisonian model of culture and distribution had come to be second
nature, very few publishing parties wanted only what copyright gave them, for
multimedia or technically sophisticated works, they wanted more than copyright
could give them, so they entered into contracts with their customers, one part
of which was the license, and another part of which was additional obligations
that they wanted users and customers to have
</p>

<p class="indent">
So over the course of decades, a copyright licence ceased to be only a licence,
and became very largely a contract for customer's obligations, because the
customer's obligations were a big part of what the party writing the licence,
which wasn't the customer, wanted to see in there.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We came along and said &quot;We don't even want all of what copyright gives us, let
alone that we want anything else&quot;, so we can use a pure licence, because most of
what we want to do is to give away copyright law, and no part of what we want to
do is to take additional obligations from people that aren't within the scope of
copyright law.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Therefore, for the first time in decades, somebody was building a business model
around a pure licence, and a whole bunch of lawyers who grew up in the world
after Edison and before Stallman said &quot;we've never seen one of those! Every
licence must be a contract, because every license involves obligations by the
licensee&quot;, and we said &quot;That's new! That's novel! That's crap!&quot;.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Users have rights: you shouldn't take people's rights
away from them using contracts, where what you're giving them is just
a program to run.  It's in the nature of the criticism we were making
of the legal institutions being used by others, that we were calling
attention to a thing which had happened barely consciously, and which
is still a kind of unreleased restriction in some people's mind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Alright, thank you very much, I appreciated it.
