    <!-- please have a look at https://fsfe.org/about/mission for existing translations -->

      <p>Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to
      control technology.</p>

      <p>Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives; and it is
      important that this technology empowers rather than restricts us. <a
      href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> gives everybody the
      rights to use, understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support
      other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.</p>
