      "Technology is for everyone...at least, that's the moral of Ada &amp;
      Zangemann: A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream by
      Matthias Kirchner and Sandra Brandstätter. This beautifully written and
      illustrated story follows a technological revolution that occurs when an
      inventor becomes enraged by the use of his creations for fun, rather than
      their intended purposes. Encouraging creative, out-of-the-box engineering
      thinking, problem-solving, and perseverance, as well as endless
      tinkering, Kirchner and Brandstätter weave a story that will encourage
      children to question who owns the technology around them, and why."
