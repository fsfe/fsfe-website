The GNU Project was announced 1983 by Richard M. Stallman and set out
in 1984 to create a Free Software Unix-like operating system. Variants
of this system, using the Linux kernel, are in wide use anywhere on
this planet. These GNU/Linux systems are the basis of every so-called
"Linux" distribution today.
