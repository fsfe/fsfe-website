Lucas Lasota, FSFE Senior Project Manager, has been with the 
organisation since 2019. In this episode, he discusses the Device 
Neutrality and Router Freedom initiatives, which aim to empower users to
 control their digital equipment with free software and end-user control
 over data.  Router Freedom specifically means the right for 
 end-users to deploy their own router/modem to access the internet, 
 making it a key element for open internet.<br/><br/>Lucas explains the 
 historic background of these initiatives,
 the issues that arise without these standards, and how individuals can 
 best support them. Join Bonnie and Lucas as they
 break down these concepts.
</p>

<p>
This is the perfect episode for everybody interested in controlling 
their devices and access to the internet.
