<p>The <a href="network.html">European Legal Network</a> is a professional network of legal experts facilitated by the FTF. Members get to know each other, share information and cooperate to increase the availability of best practice knowledge available in Free Software licensing.  The network has over 150 participants across 27 countries and four continents, and includes a broad spectrum of interests engaging in Free Software.  The European Legal Network appears to be the largest legal support structure for Free Software in the world.  It is expected that it will cover all the EU27 nations by June 2009.</p>

<p>We can assist in finding legal experts in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Greece, Germany, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands and the UK.  We also maintain contacts in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the USA.  If you want to find a legal expert in a country near you, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a legal expert interested in participating in the European Legal Network please <a href="contact.html">let us know</a>.  We are particularly interested in finding experts in the EU27 countries where we don't already have coverage.</p>

<p>Some network delegates are explicitly recommended by FSFE.  To be explicitly recommended the delegate must contribute significantly to Free Software and be <a href="legal-network-policy.html">approved</a> by the governing council of FSFE.</p>
