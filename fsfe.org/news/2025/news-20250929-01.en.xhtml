		<h1>How we celebrate "I Love Free Software Day" in Barcelona, Spain</h1>

<p>The annual "I Love Free Software Day" celebration, on 14 February, acknowledges all Free Software 
contributors for their commitment to the four freedoms (to use, study, share and improve Free Software). 
The Free Software contributors’ dedication is amazing and safeguards our software freedom. We want to 
thank all of you for work to Free Software &lt;3</p>

<p>Since we began organising events in Europe together with the <a href="/about/groups.html">FSFE is local groups</a> for the 
<a href="ilovefs.org">"I Love Free Software Day"</a>, Barcelona has regularly been taking part. The Barcelona based 
local group is a mix of people contributing and developing <a href="https://kde.org/" >KDE</a> and Free Software 
friends from Catalonia. Known as "Barcelona Free Software", they do very great and amazing events. Over time 
it was inspiring to see how the events evolved, from 
<a href="/activities/ilovefs/report/report_2023.html" >company related gatherings</a> to <a href="/activities/ilovefs/report/report_2024.html">independent 
group meetings</a> with the opportunity to welcome new Free Software enthusiasts.</p>


<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: Hello Albert, thank you so much for taking the time and answering our questions. 
It is a pleasure to do this interview with you. You are the coordinator of the Barcelona local group, 
which is also very much connected with KDE. Can you tell us a bit more about this group, and where the 
connection to KDE comes from?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong> Albert, from the Barcelona local group</strong>: BlueSystems, one of the companies employing 
people to do KDE work, opened an office in Barcelona a few years ago. At some point, people from that group 
said “Ok, we already know everyone in Barcelona that does KDE things, so let’s expand to Free Software and 
make new friends”, and that’s how Barcelona Free Software was born.</p>

<p>Since the original folks were from KDE, if some kind of official paperwork was needed, be it for 
renting something or getting a small grant or sponsorship, it was very easy to use the KDE España 
association. To this day KDE España still handles all the legal stuff for us. We are very grateful to them!</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: How many people are active in the group?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Albert</strong>: At this point I would say there are about four of us doing general coordination 
work and a similar amount helping when they can. The number of people who come to our activities is quite 
hard to measure, but I would say in a year we get around 100 different people attending.</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What are the usual activities the Barcelona local group does?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Albert</strong>: We do a monthly meetup, except for the summer break in July and August. 
There we are focusing on a wide range of topics around Free Software and adjacent Free Knowledge and 
Free Hardware.</p>

<p>For example this last year we have had talks about <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/" >VLC</a>, about a CPU being developed in the Barcelona 
Super Computing Center, about a Free Software/Hardware combination to measure sports performance and 
many more.</p> 

<p>This wide range of topics allows us to foster a thriving local community that welcomes both Free Software 
enthusiasts and curious newcomers, while at the same time attracting profiles from other communities with 
whom to carry out collaborations.</p>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: When was the first time you celebrated “I Love Free Software Day”, and how did it work out? 
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Albert</strong>: We first celebrated I Love Free Software Day in 2019, and it was quite a success; 
that year I think we even got a local company to sponsor part of the cost of food and drinks. We also learned 
that different people have different expectations and that while we had made it clear, at least we thought, 
that it was a “let’s socialize” event, we got a couple of people who left when they realized there was no 
presentation, so since that day we have tried to make sure there’s a good mix of “learning” and “socializing”.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: How did the celebration of “I Love Free Software Day” evolve over 
the next years, and what was your personal highlight while celebrating this special day? 
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Albert</strong>: 2021 was definitely a challenge since in Barcelona we still could not 
gather in big groups, so we did something online and I think it worked relatively well. The rest of 
the years we learned from our “mistake” from the first time in 2019, and we make sure there is a good 
talk at the beginning so people that want to learn more about Free Software get to do it and then a 
good part of socializing too, since we feel it goes very well with the “Let’s appreciate Free Software” 
focus of the “I Love Free Software Day” event.</p>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What did you do for I Love Free Software Day 2025?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Albert</strong>: We gathered at Akasha Hub, a Free Software friendly self-managed community; 
we did a small presentation about Free Software and used the game-like materials that FSFE had produced 
to test the knowledge of the attendees and learn some things we did not know about the big world of 
Free Software.</p>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: What would you recommend to others when they want to organise 
“I Love Free Software Day” celebrations, and what are pitfalls you would say should be avoided? 
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Albert</strong>: My main takeaways from the several years are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a good mix of presentations/talks and socializing/party. Different people are going 
to want different things but if you have a good mix of both everyone will be relatively happy. </li>
<li>Make sure the place you’re doing the event is relatively easy to get to. We have not had this 
problem with the I Love Free Software Day events, but some of our other events were in “Go to this 
building, then to 7th floor and 3rd door on the left, and there you will find a sign and also you 
will need to give ID to the person at the door” and we definitely felt that attendance would have 
been better if the instructions to get there did not feel like an Escape Room game.</li>
<li>Confirm a few of the regulars will show up; this way if the event does not attract 
lots of new people, at least you still get to socialize with your usual friends.</li>
<li>Mention that there will be food, if you are having food; of course, do not lie 
if you do not :D. We make most of our events quite close to dinner time, and if 
potential attendees know there will be food they will be less stressed about having 
to find a plan for food in a part of the city they maybe do not know that well. In this 
regard we want to thank the FSFE for sponsoring food for the Barcelona event this past couple of years. </li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: Why do you think I Love Free Software Day is important and why should 
everybody be celebrating this day?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Albert</strong>: I truly believe in the power of saying “Thank You”. Free Software developers 
are usually in a loop of bug reports and feature requests by users. We as users often see what is broken 
or what is missing, so we will communicate that to the developers, usually failing to send a message of 
how awesome the software is. This is why celebrating I Love Free Software Day and taking the time to say 
“Thank you” to the developers and projects we depend on is important; we need to break the cycle of 
negativity that sometimes the developers of Free Software are stuck in.</p>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Do you already have plans for celebrating “I Love Free Software Day 2026”?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p><strong>Albert</strong>: We will most surely celebrate in 2026 too. We have not started planning yet, 
so if anyone from the Barcelona area wants to help, please talk to us!</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Albert, thank you very much for your time!</p>
