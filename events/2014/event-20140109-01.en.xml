   <title>Berlin Fellowship Meeting with the topic "Alternatives to Google search" in Berlin, Germany</title>
   <body>
     <p>
    On January 9, there will be the next Berlin Fellowshipmeeting, as usual in the e-lok (near Ostkreuz). Luca will report about the Mobilize!-conference "Whatever happened to pivacy?" that happened in December and was organized by the Heinrich-BÃ¶ll-Stiftung. Next, Kai would like to discuss our main topic for this meeting: "Alternatives to Google search". Finally, we would like to plan an event for the Document Freedom Day, End of March, to run a joint activity.

    As usual, the Fellowship meeting is a good possibility to meet other Fellows as well as other Free Software enthusiasts. You can get good food and best drinks at e-lok for a reasonable price and good mood for no cost. Official start is at 19:30.
