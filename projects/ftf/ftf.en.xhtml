	<h1>FTF: Freedom Task Force</h1>

    <localmenu id="1">Overview</localmenu>

<p>The Freedom Task Force is a project to help people understand Free Software licensing and the opportunities it presents.  The FTF offers educational services, facilitates infrastructure activities and manages FSFE's legal affairs.  Its work focuses on the promotion of the proper use of Free Software.</p>

<h3>Our Goals:</h3>

<ul>
 <li>To share knowledge about Free Software law;</li>
 <li>To safeguard the interests of Free Software projects;</li>
 <li>To connect experts in this field;</li>
 <li>To help other groups achieve similar goals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our Methods:</h3>

<p>We believe in positive, constructive dialogue and seek at all times to support the long-term sustainability of Free Software.  As part of that support, we provide <a href="services.html">services</a> related to building up sustainable projects.  Dialogue is maintained as part of our <a href="activities.html">activities</a> on the European Legal Network and at conferences.</p>
