		<p>During election times in Germany, everybody is addressing questions to candidates. For the latter, it is a good occasion to think on issues they are not used to deal with and to take a clear position on it. Afterwards, it is easier for citizens to make a choice for the vote. It is also really useful for all civil society since they can use the obtained statements to remind elected representatives their previous stances. The aim of this campaign is therefore to spread the practice in all Europe focusing on national and European parties. Challenging them on their position on Free Software is  a very important activity which can have a big impact.</p>

	<h2>When to get active</h2>

	<p>Any time is a good time to ask your parties about Free Software, but the run up to elections provides a particularly good opportunity as more attention is paid to the policies, intentions and promises of politicians and their parties. FSFE maintains a <a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/AskYourCandidates/ELECTIONNAME-DATE">wiki calendar of elections in Europe</a> which can be used to determine the best time to initiate your own 'ask your candidates' campaign. The calendar relies on community contributed data, so please feel free to update and improve it.</p>
	
	<p>To the FSFE being able to realize a summarize of the different positions of each party during electoral periods, we recommend you to send your survey at least two months before the vote. </p>
	
	<h2>What to do</h2>
	
	<div class="left">
			<img src="/graphics/stickman-wondering.png" alt="Stickman wondering"/>
	</div>
	
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a survey, and send a printed copy to the party's postal address.</li>
			<li>Publish it (eg. on blogs.fsfe.org) in order to increase the incentive for the party to reply.</li>
			<li>Let us know that you've sent it so that we can raise awareness of your actions and help to follow them up.</li>
			<li>For each response that you receive read through the answers to your questions and summarise them on a dedicated survey answers wiki page. </li>
		</ul>	
	</p>
	
	<p>For important elections, the FSFE will summarize in a visual and simple form the answers given by the different parties. In this way, we will help every citizen to make his choice and vote in full knowledge.</p>
