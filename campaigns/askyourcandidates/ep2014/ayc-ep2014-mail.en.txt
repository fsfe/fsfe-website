Dear [ ... insert name here ... ],

the Free Software Foundation Europe, a non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting Free Software, is running a campaign "Freedom Pact" for the European Elections 2014. The campaigns is there to support Free Software and establish its use in public administrations throughout Europe. Therefore, they ask candidates to show their support of Free Software and Open Standards by signing the Freedom Pact.

I am a voter in the European Elections 2014 and I have interest in voting for a candidate that cares about Free Software, consumer rights and the freedom of electronic communication. To know, that you will represent my interests if I am going to vote for you, I kindly ask you today to sign this Freedom Pact. You find the Freedom Pact attached to this mail or you can download it from FSFE's homepage [1].
If you support Free Software, please print and fill out the Freedom Pact and send the letter to
    Free Software Foundation Europe
    Schönhause Allee 6/7
    10115 Berlin
    Germany

Afterwards, your name will be publicly visible on the campaigns page [2], so every voter in the European Union knows about your support of software freedom.

Thank you very much in advance,
