    <title>[Blog] OpenRheinRuhr 2016 report</title>

    <body>

      <p>Last weekend, the FSFE visited Oberhausen to participate in 
      OpenRheinRuhr, a well-known Free Software event in north-western 
      Germany. We had a strong booth team, gave talks, and enjoyed 
      talking to tons of like-minded people about politics, technology 
      and other stuff. In this blog post you will learn about some 
      highlights of the weekend and what coat hangers have to do with 
      flat irons. </p>
