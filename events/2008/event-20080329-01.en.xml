      <p>
      Friday, 29 March, the first Fellowship meeting in Augsburg will take
      place.<br/>

      We are going to meet in the "Thing" bar, Vorderer Lech 45, 86150
      Augsburg, right after the GNU/Linux infoday Augsburg. We expect to be
      there around 18:30.<br/>

      Anybody who does not know Augsburg very well or is at the GNU/Linux
      infoday anyway can just come to the FSFE booth at the end of the event,
      we can then go to the meeting together.
