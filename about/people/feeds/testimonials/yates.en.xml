	  Every time I use non-free software I end up regretting it, because
	  non-free software's ultimate job is to make money for someone else,
	  not to serve the user.  I simplified my personal and professional life
	  by using only free software, but that's not enough: no person is an
	  island, and other people's software choices impact me. Supporting the
	  FSFE allows me to combine my voice with many others to let people,
	  corporations, and governments know that free software has an important
	  place in everyday life.
