<blockquote>
“This case is pivotal for Free Software. Apple is trying to dodge the 
DMA rules over its app store and interoperability of its operating 
system. The FSFE’s goal is to prove that Apple is being regulated in the 
light of public interest, so the Digital Markets Act can be enforced in a Free Software 
developer-friendly way.” <cite>states Lucas Lasota, FSFE Legal Porgramme 
Manager.</cite>
