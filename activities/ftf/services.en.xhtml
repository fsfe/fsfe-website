        <h3>Administrative Support</h3>

        <p>
          FSFE can help <a href="mailto:legal@fsfeurope.org?subject=FSFE Legal Question">answer questions</a> about
          Free Software license adoption or use. Our services in this
          area range from describing the type of formal structures that
          can make using code easier through to assisting with community
          relations or resolving issues with incompliant code.  We can also
          help you find legal and technical experts to provide specialised
          services when necessary.
        </p>

        <h3>License Compliance</h3>

        <p>
          FSFE works with our partners at <a
            href="http://gpl-violations.org/">gpl-violations.org</a> to
          resolve licensing issues that affect both commercial and
          non-commercial projects or products.  Our activity in this
          sphere is purely educational and designed to help strengthen
          the long-term value proposition of Free Software.

        <h3>Fiduciary License Agreement</h3>

        <p>
          FSFE makes a specialised copyright assignment document called the
          <a href="fla.html">Fiduciary License Agreement</a> (FLA) available
          to the community at large.  The FLA allows one entity to
          safeguard all of the code created for a project by consolidating
          copyright (or exclusive exploitation rights).  We can assist
          projects adapt it for their own use.
        </p>

        <h3>Fiduciary Programme</h3>

        <p>
          FSFE uses the FLA for our <a
            href="http://www.fsfe.org/activities/ftf/fiduciary.en.html">Fiduciary
            Programme</a>.  This allows projects to assign copyright to
          FSFE, and for FSFE to assume responsibility for copyright issues
	  that may occur, freeing developers to focus on coding great 
	  technologies.
        </p>
