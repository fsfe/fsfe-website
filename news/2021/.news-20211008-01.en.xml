  <p>
    We all love the <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html#freedoms">four freedoms</a> that Free Software grants to users and developers, and how they benefit the 
    individual user as well as digital society as a whole. In order to ensure 
    these freedoms, users of Free Software rely on legal instruments and the 
    legal system to be able to enforce them when other try to take them away 
    from us.   
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    Understanding and complying with the legal frameworks and licensing 
    obligations can sometimes feel daunting. Nonetheless, some basic knowledge 
    can keep you and your software project safer from legal aspects, while it 
    helps to build a healthy Free Software environment based on openness and 
    community.
