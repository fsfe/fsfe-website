    <title>The FSFE with a lecture at the University of Tübingen in Tübingen, Germany</title>

    <body>
      <p> Throughout history technology has influenced society. Reading, writing, arithmetic, agriculture, printing and radio are all examples of developments that changed the way we interact through trade, art and science. The most important cultural technology of the 21st century is software. It runs our workplaces, laptops, mobile phones as well as less obvious places like trains, cars, televisions, washing-machines, fridges, and many other devices. Today it depends on software how the government can implement laws, who will be able to join which university or job, or if and how long people might end up in jail. As people and companies who create software, we should consider how our actions influence the distribution of power in our society — and thereby our democracy. </p>
<p> On June 25, from 20:15h to 21:45h, Matthias Kirschner, President of the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), will explain what Free Software is, why software developed with public funds should be available to all and how Power relations in our society are influenced by software. The lecture will take place in Kupferbau HS21, Hölderlinstraße 5, 72074 Tübingen. Admission is free and no registration is required. </p>
