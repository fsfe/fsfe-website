        "This modern tale is a superb parable, and a perfect illustration of
        the need for digital freedoms in our daily lives. Here we're talking
        about skateboards and toys, but tomorrow our whole lives may be limited
        by  monopolist technology companies.<br /> I love the format of this
        book, as I'm a big fan of comics. But above all, the tone is positive,
        laughing, and optimistic for the future, so that new generations will
        be stronger than we have been."
