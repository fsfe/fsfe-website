    <h1>Call for donations</h1>

      Free Software "<em>...should be seen, then, as more than just a
      different kind of product. It is a different kind of process for
      building, maintaining and changing the rules that govern
      information flows.</em>" - according to the United Nations.
    </p>
    <p>
An institution working for Free Software in Europe is the Free
Software Foundation Europe (FSFE). Its success is well known: "The
Free Software Foundation does a great job - for example by protecting
the rights of Free Software developers. Therefore we support the
FSFE", says Paul Salazar, director of marketing for the GNU/Linux
Distributor Red Hat in Europe, the middle East and Africa. He is not
alone with this positive view. Says Horst Nebgen, Vice President,
Novell, Central Europe and Managing Director, Novell, Germany: "Novell
released the installation and configuration tool "YAST" (yet another
setup tool) under the GPL (GNU General Public License), to make it
accessible for every developer. The GPL - and therefore the FSFE[/US]
by which it is published, maintained and protected - guarantees
transparency and platform independence. This assures that through the
ability of Free Software to innovate, the already proverbial
stability, security and broad network support continue to evolve and
advance. Therefore, for Novell, the Free Software Foundation Europe is
an important partner on its way into the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are of course very happy about this praise", says Georg
      Greve, President of the FSFE. "What makes this public
      appreciation particularly significant is that the FSFE never
      spared with criticism of these very companies when it seemed
      necessary. Obviously the job done by the FSFE is appreciated
      even if we even if we have to speak out quite clearly at
      times. This independence from politics, industry and other
      associations is a prerequisite for our present successes and the
      basis for our continued work."
    </p>
    <p>
      The projects of the FSFE are multifaceted: participation in the
      German government's delegation at the "World Summit on the
      Information Society (WSIS)", consulting with the European Union
      during the establishment of the framework programmes,
      participation in AGNULA, a project to build a fully Free
      Software distribution for professional musicians and multimedia
      authors and also the maintenance and advancement of the GNU
      General Public License (GPL).  This diversity costs a lot of
      money: travels round the world, production of information and
      marketing material, personnel cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The FSFE Coordinator for Germany, Bernhard Reiter, illustrates
      the background: "We want to pursue our projects at the highest
      level.  Moreover we observe an increasing demand for support of
      the public: we are asked to give speeches and to consult on
      licensing Free Software. We would like to do all of this. But
      without <a href="/help/donate.html">funding</a> our hands are
      tied.
    </p>
