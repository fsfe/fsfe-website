<p>The FTF can act as the legal guardian of Free Software projects.  Through the <a href="/projects/fla/">Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA)</a> we can consolidate and manage the legal side of things while developers focus on making sure projects accomplish their full potential.</p>

<p>The details of our <a href="/projects/ftf/guidelines.html">selection process</a>, our <a href="/projects/ftf/fiduciary-policy.html">policies</a> and our <a href="/projects/fla/">licence</a> are available for your review, though our approach can be summarised in  a sentence.  The FTF makes sure projects are in a strong legal position without being prescriptive; we don't dictate project policy or project management.  Our job is to make sure you can do your job.</p>

<p>You can contact us at any time through our <a href="form.html">online form</a> or through <a href="contact.html">email, post or telephone</a>.</p>
