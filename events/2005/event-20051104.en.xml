    <title>Fellowship meeting in Vienna</title>
    <body>
      On 4 November, starting at 18:00, a Fellowship meeting will take place in
      the "Käuzchen" in Vienna, Gardegasse 8. Karin Kosina and Reinhard Müller
      will inform about the work of the FSFE and discuss with interested
      people.

      The invitation is adressed at everybody who is interested in the FSFE,
      wants to get active himself or just likes Free Software and wants to get
      in contact with other enthusiasts, not only at those who are part of the
      <a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org/">Fellowship</a>.

      If you want to join us there, please send a short mail to
      <i>austria (at) fsfeurope.org</i> so we can reserve a big enough table.
