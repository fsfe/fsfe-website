    <title>EUCD - Copyright extensions that harm</title>
    <description>
The European Copyright Directive (EUCD) was the European equivalent of
the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). These laws not only
lead to the creation of monopolies and cartels, they also provide
serious impediments to the Freedoms of speech and press, as they
provide means for digital censorship. The FSF Europe was actively
involved in the resistance against such harmful legislation.
