      Artikel von <a href="/about/people/greve/">Georg Greve</a> (derzeit leider nur
      in Englisch verf√ºgbar):<br/>
      "The system and ideology of 'intellectual property' has evolved
      exclusively to cater to the needs of large Northern media corporations.
      Northern societies, and in particular their artists and authors, have
      massive problems with that system themselves.<br/>
      It is precisely for this system that the digital divide and current power
      inequalities are as large as they are."
