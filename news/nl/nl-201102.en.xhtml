<h1>FSFE Newsletter - February 2011</h1>

<h2>Drop a container to free web videos</h2>

<p>
Videos on the internet often prove to be literal nuicance to Free Software users. Several websites required the non-free flash video plugin to view videos. Perhaps also your friends were wondering da war ein u zuviel why you are not able to watch youtube videos within your web browser, and thought you are a freak when you started downloading videos with <a href="http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a>. With <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">gnash</a> and other programs which are able to play flash video directly the situation improved. But flash is still a pain annoying both for Free Software users and developers.
</p>

<p>
Developing HTML5 turned out to be a chance to purge this problem. It enables the user to play audio and video directly in your webbrowser. But there was disagreement which video container format should be used: H.264, <a href="http://www.webmproject.org/">WebM</a> or <a href="http://www.theora.org/">Ogg Theora</a>? MPEG LA organisation requires developers who implement H.264 to agree to a patent license which is incompatible with Free Software. So we might have ended up depending on non-free software again to watch web videos.
</p>

<p>
But now <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html">Google</a>
announced to suspend support for patent-encumbered codec H.264 and support free codecs only instead. Being the biggest provider of web videos Google's decision is a huge step to dispose of non-free video software. Our sister organisation FSF issued a <a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/supporting-webm">press release on this topic</a> and I (Matthias) was <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/mk/?p=719">interviewed by Dradio Wissen</a> about it (in German). 
</p>

<p>
Now time has come to help adopt WebM as free video format: get in contact with web site operators and ask them to distribute videos in the WebM format to get rid of H.264.

<h2>New clothes for FSFE</h2>
