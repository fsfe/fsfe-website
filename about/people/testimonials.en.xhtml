    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
        FSFE is a charity dedicated to empowering users to control technology.
        Together with our community we form a movement across Europe to build 
		our digital societies on user's and software freedom. Although there 
		will never be enough space to shed light on all the creative minds and 
		motivated people who helped us to grow our movement to and to live out 
        our mission, we still like to highlight at least some of our priceless
        community members who in one way or another shaped the FSFE's profile and who
        helped us to become what we are now.
      </p>
    

    <p>
      On this page you find diverse people from within the FSFE community,
      who are willing to let the world know that they support 
      <a href="/about/mission">our mission</a> and reflect what Free Software means to them.
      All of them left a testimonial, some answered an interview and some even made
      a video. Enjoy getting to know our community!
