	FSFE files application for leave to intervene in antitrust suit against Microsoft
    </title>
    <body>
The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) filed an application for
leave to intervene in the antitrust suit against Microsoft today. Georg
Greve, President of FSFE said: "The more Microsoft is able to purchase
its opponents' solidarity, the more important FSFE's commitment to
freedom and interoperability is."
These days, FSFE meets adversaries of freedom in various venues: In
Brussels, the 'Intellectual Property Rights European Enforcement
Directive' (IPRED2) is being pushed by the rights-holding industry, and
Microsoft has shown that it was able to rewrite the Vienna Conclusions
on ICT and Creativity for the UN World Summit on Information Society (WSIS).
