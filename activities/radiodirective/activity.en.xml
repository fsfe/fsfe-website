    <title>Radio Lockdown Directive</title>
    <description>
      An EU regulation may make it impossible to install a custom piece
      of software on most radio devices like WiFi routers, smartphones,
      and embedded devices. It requires hardware manufacturers to
      implement a barrier that disallows users to install any software
      which has not been certified by them. We are working to avoid the
      expected negative implications on user rights and Free Software,
      security, fair competition, the environment, and charitable
      community initiatives.
