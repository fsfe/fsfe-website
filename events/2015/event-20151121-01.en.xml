   FSFE will be pleased to join the Toulouse event “Le Capitole du Libre” 
   for the first time. With a booth, FSFE activists are looking forward 
   to meeting other associations and individuals. FSFE's French Coordinator 
   and Legal Team member Hugo Roy will give two talks, one is an introduction 
   to free software licenses, the other is a talk about the Skype case, 
   reverse engineering and decompilation law in France and Europe.
