            I was a solitary voice for years, explaining the principles behind Free 
            Software and its importance for people in my country in numerous 
            articles and blog posts. I wanted to belong to an organization with the 
            goal of building the digital society on 100% free software, and 
            supporting the FSFE and gaining access to its blogging and fellowship 
            infrastructure seemed like a logical first step.
