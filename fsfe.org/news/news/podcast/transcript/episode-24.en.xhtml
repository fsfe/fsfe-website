00:00.000 --> 00:19.000
Welcome to the software freedom podcast.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.800
This podcast is brought to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe,

00:21.800 --> 00:25.440
we are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.880
I'm Bonnie Merring and for this I love Free Software Day podcasts.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.400
I have two guests with me.

00:30.400 --> 00:34.960
I have Karen Sandlam from the Software Freedom Conservancy.

00:34.960 --> 00:37.840
And Karen brings an engineering and legal background,

00:37.840 --> 00:43.200
has been around for the software for ages, and also a personal interest.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.720
Bonnie just called me old, is it okay to interrupt her?

00:45.720 --> 00:50.640
Yeah, it's okay, I'm sorry.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.480
It's quite alright, that's what Free Software is about.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.560
It's about people who have been here for a long time

00:55.560 --> 00:57.320
and people who are newcomers.

00:57.320 --> 01:05.640
Karen brings an engineering and legal background, as well as a personal interest.

01:05.640 --> 01:16.440
Someone with an implemented pacemaker, she also has a real personal interest in it.

01:16.440 --> 01:22.040
And our second guest for this podcast for the I Love Free Software Day is Alexander Sander.

01:22.120 --> 01:27.160
Alex is also around for ages with the Free Software movement.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.320
You're old too.

01:29.320 --> 01:34.120
No, I just wanted to say it because I felt like this is a good equal level.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.600
Alex is way older than me.

01:37.600 --> 01:42.280
Our second guest for this I Love Free Software Day podcast is Alexander Sander.

01:42.280 --> 01:45.360
He's the FSEP Senior Policy Consultant.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.280
And Alex has been around with Free Software for a very long time.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.880
He's also since ever.

01:52.880 --> 02:01.040
Like when Free Software started in 1837, Alex Sander was here.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.760
Oh gosh.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.200
Okay, I think we have to start again.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.520
No, that's not right.

02:09.520 --> 02:10.680
Sitting next to me.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.760
Okay, I won't say anything about it.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.280
Long time on.

02:14.280 --> 02:25.600
All right, thank you, too, for joining me here for the Software Freedom podcast.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.040
And yeah, thank you so much for making the time at FOSSTEM.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.840
We're currently at FOSSTEM, actually.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.560
I found a really quiet room here.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.000
I can't believe that I managed.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
That's true.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
It's a very cool room.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.280
I can't believe you did this, either.

02:37.280 --> 02:43.760
I apologize to everybody that I have a little bit of a cold, so you heard that in my voice.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.360
You're also organizing a death room here, right?

02:47.360 --> 02:48.360
That's true.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.520
It will happen basically after the podcast, so we can't tell you how it was.

02:52.520 --> 02:55.160
No, we're going to run straight there from here.

02:55.160 --> 03:00.240
But you can definitely read on our websites afterwards how it was and can see the recordings

03:00.240 --> 03:04.560
because we will have also awesome recordings, and by that we can also follow in the death

03:04.560 --> 03:07.200
room, even if you're not around.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.640
And unfortunately, we just got a half day for this year's FOSSTEM, but still I think

03:11.640 --> 03:13.840
we got a very interesting program.

03:13.840 --> 03:17.000
Freddie, I was thinking, fortunately, we have only a half day.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
I mean, it's a very interesting program, but we've basically, it's a very busy FOSSTEM.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.480
I did a keynote this morning about outreach.

03:26.480 --> 03:32.400
Bradley has a keynote, a main track talk this afternoon, and then we have the legal death

03:32.400 --> 03:33.960
room, and there's just tons going on.

03:33.960 --> 03:39.680
And I know you're super, we had a hard time finding the schedule for this because of how

03:39.680 --> 03:40.680
busy everybody was.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.720
Yeah.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.720
Oh, no.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.720
I mean, it's always this like between the years coming up with the agenda, but I mean,

03:46.720 --> 03:52.240
we are now kind of used to it as we, it's not the first time, but still it's, yeah,

03:52.240 --> 03:53.240
it's always challenging.

03:53.240 --> 03:58.840
And I think we have like small changes until the last minute, but still.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.280
I think it's been very like, I think the program's really strong.

04:01.280 --> 04:07.200
We got more strong applications than we have in a lot of years, so it's a shame we can't

04:07.240 --> 04:12.200
have all of them, but I think in future years, we'll have, we'll be able to have some of

04:12.200 --> 04:13.200
that programming.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.200
So it's all good.

04:14.200 --> 04:19.040
Is there a talk you really would recommend to go there or?

04:19.040 --> 04:24.800
I mean, for me, it's important to like follow the debates around the whole liability and

04:24.800 --> 04:33.200
AI act debates we had, but also on interoperability that kept me and Lina busy for a very long

04:33.200 --> 04:34.200
time.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.200
So I think we'll.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.200
That's why I'm so old.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.080
I think we'll be covering it in the hot topics in the dev room.

04:39.080 --> 04:43.400
I think that's probably the, like if you were to pick one thing, it will probably cover

04:43.400 --> 04:48.840
like an overview of all of the talks that, like all of the topics that are really like

04:48.840 --> 04:49.840
current.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.840
Yeah.

04:50.840 --> 04:51.840
All right.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.640
This brings me basically to our topic.

04:53.640 --> 04:58.600
As you mentioned, liability, AI act, it's a very broad topic, so it's about the status

04:58.600 --> 05:02.000
of what a current situation of free software in the Western world.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.960
I know it has a Western world point of view with you from the USA and Alex basically from

05:08.960 --> 05:10.460
Europe.

05:10.460 --> 05:18.320
So last year, this is how I came up with the idea actually last year, you mentioned to me,

05:18.320 --> 05:23.640
you had the feeling that something was happening that free software is getting stronger and

05:23.640 --> 05:25.800
that it's more widely accepted.

05:25.800 --> 05:31.880
And this was shortly after Elon Musk took over ex formerly known as Twitter.

05:32.760 --> 05:33.760
That's how they presented now.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.760
Is there a connection?

05:34.760 --> 05:35.760
No.

05:35.760 --> 05:40.960
And a lot of people moved to Amsterdam and you really had the feeling that something

05:40.960 --> 05:43.040
was happening, right?

05:43.040 --> 05:47.640
Is it still like that or how would you say the last year has gone from Europe?

05:47.640 --> 05:48.640
I mean, absolutely.

05:48.640 --> 05:55.800
I mean, like free software is, it's a long-term issue and so our movement is constantly in

05:55.800 --> 06:00.200
a state of like highs and lows and it's like that forever and we just have to like stay

06:00.200 --> 06:05.280
focused and really think long-term because software freedom is something that is like,

06:05.280 --> 06:10.880
you know, not just this year, not just next year, but we have to think in terms of decades

06:10.880 --> 06:16.120
and even a century, like we have to be laying the groundwork and I do find that I'm still

06:16.120 --> 06:21.600
in a place of optimism when it comes to like the feeling like things are changing.

06:21.600 --> 06:27.840
I think seeing how that move to Amsterdam was not just an isolated blip, the people

06:27.840 --> 06:34.760
have continued to move and more than that, there's just this ever-growing belief that

06:34.760 --> 06:39.880
there's a problem with relying on big tech solutions and ordinary people are willing

06:39.880 --> 06:45.160
to suddenly say, oh, you know, I guess that Facebook thing isn't so good.

06:45.160 --> 06:49.200
Oh, yeah, I know that Apple has a lot of control over my computing.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.240
I don't know if I feel like comfortable about it.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.560
You know, I remember when you were talking about this weird thing about controlling my

06:54.560 --> 06:59.320
software years ago, Karen, like, I really see that there's a point to that.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.280
I don't know if you've been seeing the same thing.

07:02.280 --> 07:10.400
I mean, I'm also seeing it on a wider level when it comes to government implementing open

07:10.400 --> 07:14.520
source of free software solutions and it's interesting to see that they connected to

07:14.520 --> 07:20.320
serenity and we have a very huge debate about digital serenity and part of this is like

07:20.320 --> 07:24.960
hosting the data under your control, but also we talk about free software.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.440
And that's super interesting to see that governments like connect this debate and also

07:28.440 --> 07:34.240
won't like what we as an individual won't have like control access, transparency.

07:34.240 --> 07:38.640
That's obviously also something that governments are looking for these days and that's also

07:38.640 --> 07:42.840
something I just mentioned in the beginning with the Interoperability Europe Act or the

07:42.840 --> 07:46.880
discussion about interoperability in general and that's also something we have on our legal

07:46.920 --> 07:49.640
death room with Matthias Stömer from Switzerland.

07:49.640 --> 07:54.680
So it's the procurement of free software done by governments and they also see that

07:54.680 --> 07:58.400
interoperability is very important for them and that they can only achieve it if they

07:58.400 --> 08:02.200
have access to the source code and if they can change it.

08:02.200 --> 08:06.120
If they have access to free software, like if they use free software.

08:06.120 --> 08:10.400
I think what's upon a time in the free software world, we used to talk about like really talk

08:10.400 --> 08:14.080
about the issue from a real developer perspective that developers should have the right and

08:14.120 --> 08:20.080
I think that's still the case, you know, and that's the like the kernel for which this

08:20.080 --> 08:21.640
movement started.

08:21.640 --> 08:25.720
But what we're now starting to talk about is more like collective action and whether

08:25.720 --> 08:30.360
that's through governments, through nonprofits or through other kinds of mechanisms, having

08:30.360 --> 08:34.600
that ability so that technical and non-technical people can act at concert to have appreciable

08:34.600 --> 08:36.400
control over their technology.

08:36.400 --> 08:40.960
Like we're seeing that conversation for the first time and for the first time, I feel

08:40.960 --> 08:47.800
like we're able to start proposing really big solutions instead of small, you know,

08:47.800 --> 08:49.520
tiny move-the-needle solutions.

08:49.520 --> 08:50.640
So I don't know.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.120
Do you have an example?

08:52.120 --> 08:54.320
Um, no.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.000
Why would I have an example?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.960
No, I would say from the US perspective.

08:57.960 --> 09:01.720
Well, just to meet the counter to what Alex was saying, the US, it's more about seeing

09:01.720 --> 09:06.760
right to repair legislation popping up everywhere across the United States, not everywhere.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.720
But in quite a few prominent jurisdictions.

09:09.760 --> 09:15.200
And so people are sort of saying, you know, it's a part of our culture that we should

09:15.200 --> 09:17.400
be able to repair the technology we rely on.

09:17.400 --> 09:23.560
I mean, you know, you both are a European base, but as you may know from the like the

09:23.560 --> 09:26.920
reputation of Americans, what's more American than repairing your car?

09:26.920 --> 09:31.240
And when your car is all software, how are you going to repair your car?

09:31.240 --> 09:36.160
And so Americans are sort of starting to wake up to that and like, you know, the I fix it

09:36.160 --> 09:40.200
folks and the right to repair folks, they're done a really good job of starting to propose

09:40.200 --> 09:41.360
all this legislation.

09:41.360 --> 09:45.040
And we've been excited to be a part of the like software right to repair and helping

09:45.040 --> 09:50.640
them to understand how, you know, well, John Deere, like John Deere tractors, they, you

09:50.640 --> 09:53.000
know, they have copy-lefted software in them.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.840
And that means that there are software rights.

09:54.840 --> 10:00.640
And so the linking that software right to the hardware right to repair, I think is starting

10:00.640 --> 10:04.160
to happen in a lot of places and I'm really gratified to see it.

10:04.160 --> 10:08.120
This was also a focus of your work last year, right?

10:08.120 --> 10:09.120
The right to repair.

10:09.120 --> 10:15.160
It was like a, you were very focused on this as well with the DMCA, I think it's called.

10:15.160 --> 10:16.160
Yeah.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.160
Yeah.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.160
Yeah.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.520
But it has been around for ages now.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.160
It's the worst.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.160
Did something happen there?

10:23.160 --> 10:28.000
Was it like in the last year, did you have the feeling that you actually with this broader

10:28.000 --> 10:30.640
alliance that you formed could move something?

10:30.640 --> 10:33.880
Well, I does feel that way because, you know, we're sort of fed up.

10:33.880 --> 10:38.280
So the way that it's worked in the United States is that the digital millennium, the

10:38.280 --> 10:44.280
DMCA, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, prevents folks from like circumventing technological

10:44.280 --> 10:46.640
protection measures, basically DRM.

10:46.640 --> 10:52.440
So it's a crime to try to circumvent those technological protection measures.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.000
And that's really awful.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.160
And so what the, what they copyrighted, what they did in the legislation is they established

10:58.160 --> 10:59.320
this every three years.

10:59.320 --> 11:03.840
There's this triennial exemption period where you can say, no, no, no, no, no.

11:03.840 --> 11:08.880
I need an exemption for being able to circumvent myself because I have these important causes.

11:08.880 --> 11:14.760
And so independently, a lot of groups over the years have been submitting for their exemptions.

11:14.760 --> 11:19.560
We at Software Freedom Conservancy applied for router, exemptions for routers, for smart

11:19.560 --> 11:26.000
TVs in order to be able to determine if somebody is violating your copyrights and violating

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
the GPL.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.300
And, and I've been involved with the medical devices once so that you could circumvent technological

11:32.300 --> 11:33.300
protection measures.

11:33.300 --> 11:34.940
But, and that's been pretty successful.

11:34.940 --> 11:39.980
The Copyright Office has granted those permissions, but those only go so far as you be able to

11:39.980 --> 11:43.820
circumvent yourself, like do that work yourself.

11:43.820 --> 11:50.540
It is still absolutely illegal under any circumstances to talk about it and explain and teach to others,

11:50.540 --> 11:51.540
which is absurd.

11:51.540 --> 11:55.580
And so one of the things that happened this year is that our coalition of right to repair

11:55.580 --> 12:02.180
groups came together and we wrote an amicus brief, basically saying that it's unconstitutional

12:02.180 --> 12:03.060
in the United States.

12:03.060 --> 12:08.060
It violates free speech to not, you know, so we haven't seen any results on that yet.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.700
It's just, we just filed it in December, you're saying it was.

12:11.700 --> 12:12.860
I think so.

12:12.860 --> 12:16.940
But what was cool about that was that like it really was coming out of the people who

12:16.940 --> 12:18.940
are more focused on hardware.

12:18.940 --> 12:24.740
And yet they included my medical devices story in the, like, like prominently in the brief,

12:24.740 --> 12:29.420
just to explain as a, and used our examples for why this, why the software right to repair

12:29.420 --> 12:30.500
is so critical.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.820
So, you know, I don't know, have we seen any real result yet?

12:34.820 --> 12:36.300
It's hard to say.

12:36.300 --> 12:41.140
But like the fact that we're working more in concert and that the folks that we're advocating

12:41.140 --> 12:45.380
to a more receptive to it, means that we're really onto something good and I'm hoping

12:45.380 --> 12:47.100
that we're really see some results.

12:47.100 --> 12:51.820
I would say in the next year, but I think that's overly optimistic in the next few years.

12:51.820 --> 12:52.820
But how is this working out?

12:52.820 --> 12:58.900
It's like, it sounds like that you managed it to, to like connect different communities.

12:58.900 --> 13:02.460
So in Germany, for example, we have this movement called bits and boimers, which is

13:02.460 --> 13:07.220
basically bits and trees that we tried to bring in climate and digital right activists

13:07.220 --> 13:09.540
in one room and discuss basically these topics.

13:09.540 --> 13:10.940
Is it the same for you?

13:10.940 --> 13:11.940
That's really cool.

13:11.940 --> 13:12.940
Yeah.

13:12.940 --> 13:15.500
What kind of communities are discussing these topics in the US?

13:15.500 --> 13:16.500
Yeah.

13:16.500 --> 13:20.300
I mean, it's so I have to give my colleague Denver, a lot of Denver Gigerich, a lot of

13:20.300 --> 13:24.740
credit because he's basically been helping to bring these, these organizations together.

13:24.740 --> 13:30.620
And so he participates in monthly calls with, with mostly like hardware focused organizations,

13:30.620 --> 13:33.180
but there is a variety of organizations that participate.

13:33.180 --> 13:37.940
Some of them have a real environmental viewpoint because the right to repair really resonates

13:37.940 --> 13:41.420
with your desire to not put more equipment in landfills, right?

13:41.420 --> 13:45.100
If you could replace the software and if you could repair it, then there's a real environmental

13:45.100 --> 13:47.820
impact if you could scale that.

13:47.820 --> 13:51.340
So yeah, I mean, I think we're seeing something similar.

13:51.340 --> 13:58.300
I think we also discussed on the, during the SFS con in Bolzano, the blue angel, I think

13:58.300 --> 14:01.540
called a logo to put on the software.

14:01.540 --> 14:07.260
And that's, I think it's also interesting this discussion we also have in Europe to,

14:07.260 --> 14:12.420
to combine climate and, and software basically and to discuss basically if you can see the

14:12.420 --> 14:16.980
source code, you can make it more efficient and but that's can safeguard resources and

14:16.980 --> 14:20.500
also as you don't have to reinvent the wheel over and over again, right?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.620
So this is, I mean, we can also save energy with this.

14:22.620 --> 14:27.900
So I also think it's a debate which will keep us busy for the next decades as well.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.100
Well, so Bonnie asked me about my optimism, right?

14:30.100 --> 14:33.820
Like whether I'm still as optimistic as I was last year.

14:34.820 --> 14:38.700
No, but I was going to ask you like what your feeling is about all the legislation that's

14:38.700 --> 14:42.180
been coming down in Europe and, you know, like what's your perspective on it?

14:42.180 --> 14:46.260
How do you feel about it now that like every, everything is finalizing, right?

14:46.700 --> 14:50.900
Oh, before that, could you also mention all those legislation that are coming?

14:50.900 --> 14:53.700
Because I think otherwise we will get a bit lost.

14:53.700 --> 14:56.900
There are a lot of acts currently happening and files.

14:57.180 --> 14:58.300
Yeah, that's pretty true.

14:58.300 --> 15:03.500
So basically what we, what we are discussing or what we had discussed in Europe for the

15:03.500 --> 15:13.260
last basically years is how can we exempt free software from legislation when we want

15:13.260 --> 15:17.220
to like put the burden on those earning money with it.

15:17.220 --> 15:24.860
So and, but at the same time making sure we don't over-regulate and by thus we want to

15:24.860 --> 15:26.580
safeguard free software development.

15:26.580 --> 15:30.540
That's basically what we are trying to achieve in this legislation and what worked out quite

15:30.540 --> 15:31.220
well, I'd say.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.340
And the files have been called Cyber Resilience Act.

15:34.980 --> 15:41.540
Basically we discussed to put a CE label on software with this file and in this case for

15:41.580 --> 15:45.660
cybersecurity, then we are talking about the product liability directive.

15:45.660 --> 15:47.220
This is pretty much the same idea.

15:47.220 --> 15:53.260
So we want to put a CE label on software and the third file, which was discussed, which

15:53.260 --> 15:55.780
is going in this direction was the AI Act.

15:55.820 --> 16:02.900
We also want to have a CE label for AI, but ultimately the AI Act also talked about

16:02.900 --> 16:05.300
language models and high risk models and stuff like this.

16:05.300 --> 16:10.300
So there have been the Cyber Resilience Act and AI Act have been like topic wise a bit

16:10.300 --> 16:14.140
different, but in general we were talking about putting a CE label on software.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.740
So that's basically what we discussed.

16:15.740 --> 16:20.780
And I think I can understand the idea from a European perspective.

16:20.780 --> 16:25.300
So everything that comes to the European market needs to have this label and we had

16:25.300 --> 16:29.980
good experience, especially when we talked about toys, for example, that we can make

16:29.980 --> 16:37.940
sure that we save our children from products that might don't follow like the product

16:37.980 --> 16:38.940
rules we had in place.

16:39.260 --> 16:44.260
And that was the idea basically by lawmakers to have safe software.

16:44.260 --> 16:49.380
No, let's not discuss how useful.

16:49.740 --> 16:53.660
Yeah, no, it's a totally different topic, but that's the general take on this.

16:53.660 --> 16:53.980
Exactly.

16:53.980 --> 16:57.180
That was the general aim with this legislation.

16:57.180 --> 17:05.020
And what we tried to do is that the legislator came up with a wording set like we want to

17:05.020 --> 17:07.940
put things into service or put on to market.

17:07.940 --> 17:12.620
That was like from the one wording and the other one was talking about commercial activity.

17:13.340 --> 17:18.420
And it's super difficult to like go with these terms when we talk about free software.

17:18.420 --> 17:20.580
So just think about foundations, for example.

17:20.580 --> 17:26.220
So they definitely have like a revenue, but is this then a commercial activity in terms

17:26.220 --> 17:31.780
of like do you contribute to like the social good and then you are liable for this because

17:31.780 --> 17:37.660
you are just like, yeah, I'm giving people a difficult situation also.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.580
Definitely, definitely it was.

17:39.580 --> 17:46.060
And but I do believe like with the discussion we had, we also managed it to explain free

17:46.060 --> 17:48.180
software and not to decision makers in the last year.

17:48.180 --> 17:53.300
And it also helped a lot to make them understand how the whole ecosystem looks like and how

17:53.300 --> 17:54.060
it's working.

17:54.060 --> 17:58.860
And they are also now coming to foster them, for example, and want to run into people and

17:58.860 --> 17:59.700
learn more about it.

17:59.700 --> 18:03.460
So and that's also a good result of people from the European Commission, from the European

18:03.460 --> 18:07.740
Parliament and the council are going to a conference like the foster to learn more about

18:07.740 --> 18:08.740
what they are regulating.

18:09.060 --> 18:15.100
And I think that's something we should also encourage and like look that we not only talk

18:15.100 --> 18:21.140
to us, but that we also like do outreach activities and try to explain free software

18:21.140 --> 18:24.380
to people that are not so much aware about these topics.

18:24.380 --> 18:28.260
And I do believe that this worked out very, very well with this discussion we had in the

18:28.260 --> 18:28.740
last year.

18:28.940 --> 18:29.820
So you're optimistic.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.980
Yeah, that was now my question as well.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.100
So how is your optimism feel now?

18:37.020 --> 18:43.100
I mean, I was quite optimistic already, I think last year that so because the thing is we had

18:43.100 --> 18:47.220
it already in the Commission already proposed the exemption, which is good.

18:47.220 --> 18:52.460
So the exemption itself was not good, but they already had in mind that they have to

18:52.460 --> 18:54.260
regulate it somehow differently.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.980
And that that was a good starting point.

18:56.980 --> 19:00.500
And not everything was super nice and shiny.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.500
And I do believe we also have to clean up the mess a bit.

19:04.100 --> 19:09.860
So to say in the next month, I think it's also good that we are going for a next term so

19:09.860 --> 19:14.580
that everything renews a bit, also in the institutions, but also maybe we have the time

19:14.580 --> 19:23.940
to reflect a bit in our movement, how we should like jump into future debates and how

19:23.940 --> 19:27.580
we maybe could better collaborate also as community.

19:28.580 --> 19:33.860
This is definitely something where we need to invest some time to discuss all of this.

19:33.860 --> 19:40.580
But in general, I'd say we can all be quite happy what we achieved in total.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.340
It's not perfect.

19:41.340 --> 19:42.260
It's far from perfect.

19:42.780 --> 19:47.420
Also, it's absolutely not fully clear how it will look like in reality.

19:47.420 --> 19:52.540
I mean, it's always the case with legislation that you will not fully know how it will like

19:52.540 --> 19:54.020
then look in five years.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.860
And maybe we need to adapt the rules then.

19:56.580 --> 20:03.060
So we definitely need to monitor a lot of guidelines or delegated acts.

20:03.380 --> 20:09.260
So basically to say decisions that have to be taken in the future by the European Commission,

20:09.260 --> 20:11.780
for example, and this is definitely something we need to monitor.

20:12.420 --> 20:18.180
But in general, what we have now and also what we discussed is something we can reuse

20:18.180 --> 20:21.500
for future debates and we can build on the wording we have.

20:21.540 --> 20:22.540
And that's something good.

20:23.300 --> 20:29.340
So you would say there in the last year, Christopher made a step forward because now

20:29.340 --> 20:37.980
it's more widely known and there is some groundwork done again and we can continue from here.

20:37.980 --> 20:47.420
I do believe when you look on this governmental level, then I'd say it pretty much started

20:47.460 --> 20:54.300
with these corona tracing apps when governments understood in practice how cross-border collaboration

20:54.300 --> 21:00.860
looks like and how you can do this procurement of basically free software, which is super easy

21:00.860 --> 21:08.140
because you just take it from, in this case, Germany and do a translation and then you

21:08.140 --> 21:10.500
can have a cross-border app and use it everywhere.

21:10.500 --> 21:14.500
And this is a moment where governments understood, oh, this is really cool and we want to have

21:14.500 --> 21:15.500
this as well.

21:15.500 --> 21:19.620
Then the debate about digital sovereignty that also contributes to this.

21:19.620 --> 21:24.380
We have governments procuring more and more free software, thus we have also more and

21:24.380 --> 21:26.260
more best practice examples.

21:26.260 --> 21:31.540
And we had this debate around liability and the AI Act and also with the large language

21:31.540 --> 21:37.460
models we talked a lot about free software and that helped that people better understand

21:37.460 --> 21:38.460
free software.

21:38.460 --> 21:41.140
And this, I think, also leads to better regulation.

21:41.300 --> 21:47.380
It's way better if you know what you are regulating than if you are doing it by, I'm not fully

21:47.380 --> 21:48.780
sure, but I'm going to regulate.

21:48.780 --> 21:49.780
Yeah.

21:49.780 --> 21:55.500
I mean, lest everything sound like sunshine and roses, I would say that in the pandemic,

21:55.500 --> 22:02.420
it was really disappointing how many proprietary solutions were settled on widely by big sections

22:02.420 --> 22:03.420
of society.

22:04.180 --> 22:13.660
In the United States, the software used for COVID tracking and other things was proprietary.

22:13.660 --> 22:19.340
There were a lot of disappointing developments, but nonetheless, I still, I agree with you

22:19.340 --> 22:20.340
otherwise.

22:20.340 --> 22:24.420
I mean, I think we continue to push things forward and we're always working for that

22:24.420 --> 22:25.420
next opportunity.

22:25.420 --> 22:30.820
Bradley, who I work with, Bradley Kuhn who works with me at Software Freedom Conservancy

22:30.860 --> 22:35.100
says, we're working for Software Freedom in 300 years.

22:35.100 --> 22:40.980
We're laying the groundwork now so that later people could come back and they have the ideological

22:40.980 --> 22:45.060
underpinnings and they have a map and they can look at the failures and they can look

22:45.060 --> 22:47.900
at how things unraveled and they could rebuild in a sensible way.

22:47.900 --> 22:53.100
I don't know that I'm willing to give up on Software Freedom in my lifetime, but it's

22:53.100 --> 22:55.420
very difficult to live only in Software Freedom now.

22:55.420 --> 23:01.700
It's impossible if you have to do things for yourself like book of flight.

23:01.700 --> 23:03.100
It's very difficult to do.

23:03.100 --> 23:08.580
I think we have to be sanguine about the challenges that we are facing, which are considerable,

23:08.580 --> 23:14.140
but the opportunities to present these issues as ones that are societal issues and to get

23:14.140 --> 23:18.980
legislators and other public-facing people to care about it is so much greater than it

23:18.980 --> 23:19.980
was before.

23:20.340 --> 23:26.940
And also, there is a good best practice example now in the USA with, or let me check the name,

23:26.940 --> 23:35.860
I noted it down, the National, the Center for Medical, Medicaid and Medicare Services

23:35.860 --> 23:39.780
has been launching the first open source program office.

23:39.780 --> 23:40.780
Yeah.

23:40.780 --> 23:44.620
I was pretty amazed by reading this, I was like, oh my God, I never thought this would

23:44.620 --> 23:45.620
be happening.

23:46.260 --> 23:49.100
I was like, aren't they?

23:49.100 --> 23:50.100
I'm sure.

23:50.100 --> 23:57.060
So I had to double check, I was reading two or three different newspapers about it.

23:57.060 --> 24:01.900
I think the person who is involved with that has been long involved in the free software

24:01.900 --> 24:02.900
world.

24:02.900 --> 24:03.900
Yeah, that's what she said.

24:03.900 --> 24:04.900
Yeah, yeah.

24:04.900 --> 24:05.900
So that's really cool.

24:05.900 --> 24:10.700
I mean, it just shows that when we bring people in and get them up to speed, they go

24:10.700 --> 24:13.220
elsewhere and do really cool stuff.

24:13.220 --> 24:20.380
I mean, I want to be optimistic, but this desire to create OSPOs everywhere is very

24:20.380 --> 24:24.780
well-intentioned, but I have to say that a lot of times it doesn't actually result in

24:24.780 --> 24:25.780
more free software.

24:25.780 --> 24:33.060
It results in offices and conversations about that basically wind up having institutions

24:33.060 --> 24:36.100
use the stuff they were going to use anyway.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.700
But I'd like to see that, I mean, they're baby steps, right?

24:39.700 --> 24:44.300
There have been good collaboration that have come from some OSPOs and I don't know if every

24:44.300 --> 24:50.100
single thing needs to have an OSPO, but everything could because there's free software in everything

24:50.100 --> 24:55.740
somehow, somewhere, even if it's not copy left, so it doesn't really give you rights,

24:55.740 --> 25:01.380
even if it's fragmented and proprietorized, even if it's exploitative.

25:01.380 --> 25:02.380
Yeah.

25:02.380 --> 25:08.980
But we also have this movement in Europe that we see more OSPOs everywhere and also do have

25:08.980 --> 25:14.020
the feeling that it's not really contributing to more free software, but more chats about.

25:14.020 --> 25:20.740
No, but I also do believe in particular when we talk about administrations, for example,

25:20.740 --> 25:25.140
I'm not sure if this is the best approach to first set up an OSPO.

25:25.140 --> 25:30.460
I think it's more important to work on the mindset and if you have a proper mindset,

25:30.460 --> 25:33.660
you don't need the OSPO and the other way around.

25:33.660 --> 25:35.540
Completely agree.

25:35.620 --> 25:40.700
I sometimes, it's not often, but I sometimes have the feeling it also goes in the direction

25:40.700 --> 25:45.580
of having a thick leaf, basically, and you can then just say, look, I have OSPO, talk

25:45.580 --> 25:48.260
to these people and I don't have to care anymore.

25:48.260 --> 25:56.220
And so we also need to see where this development goes, but I'm also not the biggest fan of

25:56.220 --> 26:02.220
these OSPOs and I really don't see the actual need in every case where they set up an OSPO,

26:02.220 --> 26:03.220
to be honest.

26:03.220 --> 26:04.220
Yeah.

26:04.540 --> 26:05.540
All right.

26:05.540 --> 26:11.580
So you're quite looking forward into the future and how can people actually participate

26:11.580 --> 26:18.420
in this and how can people help bring this, help with the movement and help to make this.

26:18.420 --> 26:21.940
On the one hand, we have to safeguard what we have.

26:21.940 --> 26:22.940
That's for sure.

26:22.940 --> 26:31.300
But also, I mean, as Kevin also said, maybe it sounded a bit too nice, but what I just

26:31.380 --> 26:37.420
said, it's not everything is just super mind-blowing or something good in Europe when you talk

26:37.420 --> 26:38.420
about free software.

26:38.420 --> 26:42.980
So, I mean, we also, for example, still run our campaign, public money, public code,

26:42.980 --> 26:44.740
and this is still needed.

26:44.740 --> 26:50.340
So we are very far away from the point where every administration is using free software

26:50.340 --> 26:53.980
or that they are even only procuring for software.

26:53.980 --> 26:59.540
So just recently in Germany, the budget have been cut for free software and billions of

26:59.580 --> 27:02.340
euro have been spent to procure oracle, for example.

27:02.340 --> 27:04.980
So there's still a lot to do.

27:04.980 --> 27:09.500
And in this regard, for example, you can help us by signing this campaign.

27:09.500 --> 27:16.300
I think it's very important that we show that a lot of people like demand with us that

27:16.300 --> 27:19.860
every administration should procure free software.

27:19.860 --> 27:24.900
And all what you can also do is, and this works out quite well, is to go to your local

27:24.940 --> 27:27.100
administration and talk to them and convince them.

27:27.100 --> 27:30.260
And we have dedicated materials for this.

27:30.260 --> 27:34.780
We have a brochure made for decision makers for local administrations, which you can download

27:34.780 --> 27:36.020
or order on our website.

27:36.020 --> 27:38.500
And you can use it to convince your local administration.

27:38.500 --> 27:43.260
And we have seen, for example, volunteers who managed to convince a whole parliament

27:43.260 --> 27:48.220
to sign our campaign, the Parliament of Asturias in Spain, where Hackspace worked for like

27:48.220 --> 27:52.740
pretty much like one, one and a half year to convince the parliament to sign this campaign.

27:52.740 --> 27:54.500
And I think that's awesome work.

27:54.500 --> 28:00.860
And this also shows how you can, as a volunteer on a regional and local level, make a huge

28:00.860 --> 28:01.340
change.

28:01.340 --> 28:07.180
And that's something I think you can still do where you can learn from best practices.

28:07.180 --> 28:10.860
You can see that it works out and where you can make a change.

28:10.860 --> 28:16.820
And this, for example, definitely something where you can not only help us as FSFE, but

28:16.820 --> 28:18.740
basically the whole movement.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.620
And we also do have other campaigns.

28:21.660 --> 28:30.860
So if you are young, for example, I think that's some body, very, very old stars between

28:30.860 --> 28:36.820
14 and 18, for example, we are running a use hacking for freedom contest.

28:36.820 --> 28:42.100
And that's also something where we are looking for, for, yeah, basically, free software

28:42.100 --> 28:44.260
contributions from, from teenagers.

28:44.260 --> 28:47.580
And we have seen some pretty cool projects in the last two years.

28:47.980 --> 28:54.220
And that's also something where you can take part and contribute to the movement, basically.

28:54.740 --> 28:59.300
And I mean, we have other campaigns like on router freedom, basically device

28:59.300 --> 29:00.900
neutrality is a topic we cover.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.900
And there are so many activities you can join.

29:03.900 --> 29:11.340
And we have a dedicated part on our website where you can like click and join.

29:11.340 --> 29:16.780
And you can also help Bonnie, for example, with translations, which is also heavily

29:16.780 --> 29:20.500
needed, because I do believe that translation plays also an important role when we

29:20.500 --> 29:24.580
talk about Europe and like the distribution of news.

29:25.420 --> 29:26.660
Yeah, no, it's true.

29:26.660 --> 29:31.500
Like with translations, you always make information available to people who do not

29:31.500 --> 29:32.140
speak English.

29:33.140 --> 29:34.940
And so thank you, Alex.

29:36.020 --> 29:40.060
Karen, for you, from your side, what's funny, I was going to give a similar, like

29:40.180 --> 29:43.100
think globally act locally kind of answer.

29:43.980 --> 29:49.020
You know, like, it's, I always say, it's never a bad time to talk about software

29:49.020 --> 29:52.540
freedom, like talk about software freedom in the doctor's office.

29:53.940 --> 30:00.540
The grocery store, my relatives, and, you know, like, it's, it's, it's having a

30:00.540 --> 30:05.580
network of people that are like you people listening that talking to the folks that

30:05.580 --> 30:10.820
you know, not in a like preachy kind of like, like you've got to listen to the

30:10.820 --> 30:12.180
thing I'm talking about.

30:12.180 --> 30:15.980
And if you don't understand, you're a bad person, but more like, have you thought

30:15.980 --> 30:16.500
about this?

30:16.500 --> 30:17.260
And it's really cool.

30:17.260 --> 30:18.580
And this is what I care about.

30:18.580 --> 30:19.940
And have you thought about it?

30:19.940 --> 30:22.180
And like, you know, we really could do things differently.

30:22.180 --> 30:26.180
Like there are gentle conversations that you could consistently have that make a

30:26.180 --> 30:30.380
huge difference, even if you're not going to, you know, your local legislature,

30:30.380 --> 30:31.620
which I recommend that you do.

30:31.860 --> 30:33.580
But like that's a lot for some people.

30:33.580 --> 30:36.700
It's enough for you to just persistently talk about it.

30:36.940 --> 30:41.660
I am that annoying person at like parent teacher meetings who raises my hand and

30:41.660 --> 30:45.860
say, says, do we really need to be using Google accounts for that?

30:45.860 --> 30:47.500
Like Google services for this?

30:47.500 --> 30:52.300
Because, you know, like, you know, or, or Zoom is like a really problematic

30:52.300 --> 30:55.580
technology, just want to like take a second and like, maybe think about if we

30:55.580 --> 30:56.620
could do something better.

30:56.900 --> 31:00.420
And we're at the point where I was saying where people respond to that.

31:00.660 --> 31:04.980
So, you know, and then I think if you want to act really locally, you could take

31:04.980 --> 31:07.900
a look at the things that you buy.

31:08.540 --> 31:13.740
And if there's copy left at software in your devices with anything embedded,

31:14.020 --> 31:19.140
then you can, you can ask for that source code, check and see if there's an

31:19.140 --> 31:22.100
offer for source and ask the company for the source.

31:22.140 --> 31:26.580
Like the more people that do it, the more companies get the message that

31:26.700 --> 31:29.380
following the rules and providing the source code is important.

31:29.660 --> 31:33.620
And then, you know, like we're working on ways by the time this is released,

31:33.620 --> 31:37.860
we'll have launched a website called, called use the source where people can

31:37.860 --> 31:41.820
come and if you get a source candidate from requesting source code, you can put

31:41.820 --> 31:46.620
it up there and analyze it, see if it's like a compliance and then work together.

31:46.620 --> 31:50.060
If there's something you want to fix or if there's something that, you know, if

31:50.060 --> 31:54.420
there's, if there's some kind of way that we could use the source code to make

31:54.420 --> 31:59.260
our, our equipment better, like that's a, a place that we could start.

31:59.420 --> 32:00.740
So I'm really excited about that.

32:00.740 --> 32:02.900
And I think that's actually launching today at Fossam.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.020
Wow.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.260
That sounds pretty nice.

32:06.660 --> 32:11.980
Um, if something is happening, like if some, if they don't respond correctly,

32:12.020 --> 32:13.140
is there any help?

32:14.140 --> 32:14.780
Yeah, I mean, so

32:14.780 --> 32:17.020
If you could offer from the Freedom Conservancy.

32:17.100 --> 32:21.020
So what I'm really excited about this is that this is like a way for ordinary

32:21.020 --> 32:24.860
people to learn how to check whether source code is in compliance.

32:25.100 --> 32:28.580
And so it's a forum where people can teach each other and talk to each other.

32:28.900 --> 32:33.100
And, um, we at Software Freedom Conservancy, we hold all of these skills.

32:33.100 --> 32:34.700
There are a few people that are around.

32:34.700 --> 32:38.260
Some people work, help with the FSFE with us once in a while, but like really

32:38.260 --> 32:41.740
we've got the, like the, the shop of people, like all the people who used to

32:41.740 --> 32:44.740
work at the Free Software Foundation doing it and now working for us.

32:44.900 --> 32:50.540
And it's wrong for us to just have that knowledge in-house and, you know, not

32:50.540 --> 32:51.140
share it.

32:51.180 --> 32:55.700
And so this is like a real effort to bring GPL compliance checking into the

32:55.700 --> 32:58.500
public and anyone can learn it and you can all check it.

32:58.620 --> 33:01.100
Like, so, so that's the idea about it.

33:01.460 --> 33:04.420
As far as companies are concerned, like, will we help them?

33:04.620 --> 33:05.660
You know, it's really interesting.

33:05.660 --> 33:09.300
We decided that what we're going to do is we're going to give, we're going to

33:09.300 --> 33:12.700
let companies register with our website.

33:13.300 --> 33:18.060
And if they register with Use the Source, if somebody wants to post a source

33:18.060 --> 33:23.580
candidate for a company's products, then we will notify the company if they

33:23.580 --> 33:27.900
registered with us and they'll have seven days to, like, double check whether

33:27.900 --> 33:31.220
or not that's like a source candidate they want there.

33:31.540 --> 33:36.780
And so, like, to begin a dialogue and then folks could, you know, like, you

33:36.780 --> 33:40.780
know, there, these are source candidates that have been published so or been

33:40.780 --> 33:41.540
sent around.

33:41.540 --> 33:45.500
So the company should stand behind them, but it's a further way to engage

33:45.500 --> 33:47.820
those companies so that we could see more compliance in the long run.

33:47.820 --> 33:52.740
And our lawsuits in the United States are really focused on establishing a

33:52.780 --> 33:56.020
third party right to be able to get your source code.

33:56.300 --> 33:59.420
And so that's what we've been really focused on because while it's important

33:59.420 --> 34:02.940
that the folks that write the software that have the copyrights are able to

34:02.940 --> 34:08.140
license the code in a way that's shared, ultimately, if that doesn't result in

34:08.140 --> 34:12.460
downstream people getting the source code and, like, being able to modify it,

34:12.460 --> 34:14.500
then it doesn't really stand for very much.

34:14.540 --> 34:18.180
So I'm excited to see we recently had a decision.

34:18.900 --> 34:25.100
It's just a procedural decision, but the judge in our Visio case wrote very,

34:25.100 --> 34:30.100
very strongly saying that there are third party rights with respect to enforcement.

34:30.100 --> 34:33.380
So I'm really excited about that and we'll see it all kind of fits together.

34:33.380 --> 34:37.740
So ask, ask for your, ask for your source, everybody, exercise your offer.

34:39.820 --> 34:45.380
I take this as a good word for my last and final question.

34:46.020 --> 34:48.100
You all know I love Free Software Day on this day.

34:48.100 --> 34:50.820
We say thank you to all the contributors for free software.

34:51.540 --> 34:54.260
And I would like to hear from you.

34:54.260 --> 34:58.500
Is there a, is there a project or a contributor that you would like to say

34:58.500 --> 35:02.700
thank you to? If there is someone who pops into your mind.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.780
I know Alex Free Software Games.

35:04.780 --> 35:06.780
Alex loves Free Software Games.

35:06.780 --> 35:07.780
I have a new one.

35:07.780 --> 35:08.780
I have a new one.

35:08.780 --> 35:09.780
I'm sorry.

35:09.780 --> 35:11.780
OK, don't know what I hear.

35:12.180 --> 35:14.620
I was in the conference last year in Valencia

35:14.620 --> 35:18.260
and that was a community of coin collectors.

35:18.260 --> 35:23.180
And these coin collectors are using a free software tool that brings them together.

35:23.740 --> 35:26.340
And I learned a lot about collecting coins,

35:27.420 --> 35:29.380
but even more about this awesome tool.

35:29.380 --> 35:34.300
And that's, I think, something it's, it's a tool made by, I think, a few people.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.060
And it's called DelDao.

35:37.060 --> 35:41.900
And it's basically, yeah, out there to bring together these,

35:41.900 --> 35:46.100
these communities collecting coins, but also there's a university in New York

35:46.100 --> 35:53.140
and the professor is using the tool to collect some historic data about interviews she made.

35:53.140 --> 35:59.940
And so you can also see how the tool is like growing with the needs of the community.

35:59.940 --> 36:04.260
And it's, it was just like lovely to see how they interacted for two days

36:04.700 --> 36:10.420
in order to come together around a tool which was created by two people, basically.

36:10.420 --> 36:14.660
And that was just lovely to see and basically exactly this

36:14.660 --> 36:17.580
while of this free software community so much.

36:17.580 --> 36:21.220
So that was just an outstanding moment and a lovely conference.

36:21.220 --> 36:24.140
And that's why I want to mention them here in this podcast and want to thank them,

36:24.460 --> 36:27.060
even if I'm not using the tool.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.740
No coin collector.

36:28.740 --> 36:30.340
I'm not a coin collector.

36:30.340 --> 36:31.500
But it sounds really nice.

36:31.500 --> 36:35.460
I think this is the spirit of free software that we need this community spirit.

36:35.460 --> 36:39.700
And this we are here together and let's start this movement.

36:39.940 --> 36:40.580
Absolutely.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.500
Karen, you're thank you.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.580
I have two things that I'm going to say.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.260
I think I hope that's okay.

36:46.260 --> 36:47.860
The first one is you, Bonnie.

36:47.860 --> 36:48.740
Oh my God, no.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.340
Oh, I know, I know.

36:50.340 --> 36:54.500
It is because you bring so much enthusiasm to these conversations.

36:54.500 --> 36:58.100
And like, I have to say, like I've talked to you more over the last year

36:58.100 --> 37:03.620
and like every time I talk to you, I'm so impressed with how committed to software freedom you are

37:03.620 --> 37:09.540
and how you're able to drive the conversation in ways that make it a lot more impactful and effective.

37:09.620 --> 37:10.820
So thank you.

37:10.820 --> 37:12.180
I really appreciate you.

37:12.180 --> 37:12.820
Thank you.

37:12.820 --> 37:13.620
That's really nice.

37:13.620 --> 37:17.140
But lest I seem like I'm trying to butter up the host of this podcast.

37:18.660 --> 37:21.460
The second thing that popped into my head is a little premature

37:21.460 --> 37:23.940
because I haven't actually used it yet, but I'm really excited.

37:23.940 --> 37:25.140
I'm so excited to that.

37:25.700 --> 37:31.940
It's valetudo because I bought, I've always wanted a robot vacuum.

37:31.940 --> 37:35.140
And it's all part of our devices are really problematic.

37:35.140 --> 37:36.260
They're super problematic.

37:37.140 --> 37:40.180
Like they're, and valetudo doesn't solve all the problems,

37:40.180 --> 37:44.020
but it does at least allow you, it is free software and it allows you

37:44.020 --> 37:47.220
to not have your robot vacuum centralized.

37:47.220 --> 37:52.500
And you can limit, you can basically replace a good amount of the software with free software.

37:52.500 --> 37:56.740
And I'm super excited to be able to try out a robot vacuum in my house.

37:57.860 --> 37:59.780
I'm also super excited for this.

37:59.780 --> 38:00.820
I'll have to report back.

38:00.820 --> 38:05.460
And you know, I'm also going to have to like figure out if the robot vacuum,

38:05.460 --> 38:09.140
when I get it, I have to figure out, like, you know, if there's an offer for source,

38:09.140 --> 38:13.300
like how badly the vacuum is in violation and like, you know,

38:13.300 --> 38:17.940
whether or not we really should be having access to the, you know, like, but,

38:17.940 --> 38:21.460
but nonetheless, I think this is, this is a really cool project.

38:21.460 --> 38:22.980
And I'm very excited to try.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.180
All right.

38:30.180 --> 38:32.100
Thank you too for being here.

38:32.100 --> 38:35.380
Thank you for talking about free software with me and the current status.

38:35.380 --> 38:41.060
I know it's a broad topic, but I still have the feeling that we're getting closer

38:41.620 --> 38:44.420
to software freedom, even if it's in us 300 years.

38:44.420 --> 38:46.100
I don't believe that, to be honest.

38:46.100 --> 38:47.220
I don't believe that at all.

38:47.220 --> 38:48.180
I don't either.

38:48.180 --> 38:50.180
I'm more positive about this.

38:50.180 --> 38:52.260
I would say there's so much happening.

38:52.260 --> 38:53.460
There's so much going on.

38:53.460 --> 38:59.220
And especially with, I have to feeling like over the past year, you talk to so many MPs

38:59.860 --> 39:03.940
and it's like crazy how many of them are listening and how many of them

39:03.940 --> 39:10.180
actually understood free software, even if they are not like changing it in this moment.

39:10.180 --> 39:13.380
It is a groundwork and it's happening.

39:13.380 --> 39:19.540
And also every time I research free software in the US, it's like,

39:19.540 --> 39:24.020
I do have the feeling that it's also, yeah, I really have the feeling that

39:24.020 --> 39:25.140
there is a lot of optimism.

39:25.380 --> 39:31.780
The FCC reached out to us to ask us to participate in a panel to get information from us.

39:31.780 --> 39:32.580
And that was public.

39:32.580 --> 39:36.900
And then the FCC submitted that panel to the copyright office without even,

39:37.460 --> 39:40.180
like as part of their own process.

39:40.180 --> 39:41.060
And that was very exciting.

39:41.060 --> 39:43.300
We submitted our own comments to the copyright office.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.300
We submitted our own comments to NIST.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.100
So we're trying to be active in all of those forums,

39:48.100 --> 39:53.300
but to see the interest coming from the agencies before we even were reaching out to them is great.

39:55.140 --> 39:59.140
Optimism, it's happening and we can all participate.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.860
So this is the most important thing.

40:01.860 --> 40:03.860
So thank you too for being here.

40:03.860 --> 40:06.420
And with this, I will release you to your death room.

40:10.020 --> 40:13.140
This will happen quite soon as far as I hear.

40:15.700 --> 40:17.540
This was the Software Freedom podcast.

40:17.540 --> 40:20.900
This podcast is brought to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

40:20.900 --> 40:24.500
