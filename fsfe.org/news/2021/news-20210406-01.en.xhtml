    <h1>FSFE Spring Sales: buy discounted Free Software merchandise now</h1>

    <p>
      Finally! Spring is here, hot weather is coming, and it’s sale time in
      <a href="/order/order.html">the FSFE shop</a>! That's why we offer all
      our coloured T-shirts, magnets, pins, gym sacks and children shirts at a
      reduced price for a short period.

    <p>
      If you've always wanted a T-shirt with the slogan “There is no cloud,
      just other people's computers” you can find them in red or blue; if you
      like the T-shirt which shows your love for Free Software in many
      languages, or a new PMPC magnet for your fridge, this could be your last
      chance. <a href="/order/order.html">The offer</a> is only valid while
      stock lasts. Sale products that are sold out will no longer be reordered
      as we will refresh our inventory.
    </p>

    <p>
      With every purchase you also support the work of the FSFE and you get a
      nice free gift. By the way: the “I am a fork” kids shirt is also a
      wonderful gift, we have already tested this out several times ourselves.
