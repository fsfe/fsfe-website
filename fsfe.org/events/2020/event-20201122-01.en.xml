        <title>The long road to software freedom: What can you do?, online, Germany</title>

    <body>
      <p>On 22 November, at 10:00am (CET), Matthias Kirschner, President of FSFE, will speak at this year's KNF Congress about the work of the Free Software Foundation Europe. "Public Money? Public Code", router freedom, Radio Equipment Directive, easier help with licensing or "Free Your Android". These are some of the activities FSFE has been doing since 2001 in order to enable people to use technology in a self-determined way. Using concrete examples from the areas of public relations, policy work and legal actions on Free Software, Kirschner gives an insight into the way the FSFE works and presents possibilities for cooperation. Registration is required for the KNF Congress, but it is free.</p>
