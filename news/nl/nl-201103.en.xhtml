<h1>FSFE Newsletter - March 2011</h1>

<h2>Revolution failed: Facebook not available in Egypt</h2>

<p>"On 27th January facebook was shut down in Egypt. For the
moment this stopped the protests. Media assumes that this is due to the
influence of Mubarak's granddaughter who is Mark Zuckerberg's girl-friend." Of
course this is not true. But with software which is controlled by one company,
something like this can happen. What if the owner of the social network would
have been an Egypt company? Would this company have been able to resist state
pressure?</p>

<p>For a long time dedicated people have been working on decentralised Free
Software solutions, to make sure there is no vulnerable single point of
control. We as citiziens should be in control of our tools, and as most of
those tools today are comprised of software we do need decentralised software.
That's why FSFE organised a related <a
  href="http://www.fscons.org/divide">track at FSCONS</a>, and our staff as
well as dedicated volunteers like Torsten Grote <a
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/CloudComputing">gather information</a>, <a
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/CloudComputing#Video">give talks</a> or <a
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/CloudComputing#Audio">interviews</a>. </p>

<p>Karsten Gerloff gave a talk on <a
  href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/gerloff/2011/02/05/fosdem-talk-on-power-software-freedom/">
  "Power Software Freedom"</a> (there is a <a
  href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/bjg/2011/02/decentralised-systems-and-the-tendency-to-centralisation/">
  good summary by Brian Gough</a>) at FOSDEM this month, and one of the event's
keynotes <a
  href="http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/fosdem/2011/maintracks/political.xvid.avi">"Why
  Political Liberty Depends on Software Freedom More Than Ever"</a> by Eben
Moglen targetted this topic as well, especially the so-called <a
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/CloudComputing#Freedom_Boxes">"Freedom Box"</a>
which started to receive good media coverage in turn, and will hopefully push
this topic even further.</p>


<h2>Lawyered! - FSFE's legal workshop</h2>

<p>More than 75 lawyers, for 2 days, in 1 room -- and all of this organised by
the FSFE. What is it about? We do this to ensure that the best possible legal
knowledge about Free Software is shared between everyone, no matter whether
individuals, businesses or initiatives.</p>

<p>As part of this, FSFE facilitates an annual event called <a
  href="/activities/ln/llw.html">European Legal Network
  Conference</a> to allow legal experts to discuss the future of Free Software
law and governance. This has become the world's premier event for debating,
discussing and sharing knowledge around Free Software legal affairs. </p>

<p>This year it will be held at the NH Barbizon Palace, Amsterdam, between the
7th and 8th of April, and will feature speakers like Carlo Piana from FSFE,
Mark Shuttleworth from Canonical, Eben Moglen from SFLC, and Harald Welte from
gpl-violations.org.</p>
