      <p>
    At the annual all-day event in Graz, lots of presentation talks and information 
    booths offer visitors the possibility to catch up on information about GNU/Linux, 
    Free Software and related projects. 
    The event location is the <a href="http://www.fh-joanneum.at/">FH Joanneum</a> and 
    the event is an absolute 'must see' for everyone interested in those topics.<br/>
    FSFE will be present with a information booth, and Peter Bubestinger holds a speech 
    titled "Free Software and art(ists): Here be dragons!"
