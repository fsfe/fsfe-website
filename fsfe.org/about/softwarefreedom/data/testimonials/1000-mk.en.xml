    “Formulating the four freedoms, -that everyone should have the right to use software for
    any purpose, to be allowed to understand it, to share it with others, and to improve the
software depending on your own needs–, was visionary at the time and achieving it felt
almost impossible. But it inspired many people around the world from different
backgrounds to join this movement, each one contributing a piece of a puzzle that in sum
changed the history of computing. Today those freedoms become more and more crucial
to preserve democracies by distributing power over technology.“
