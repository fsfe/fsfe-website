<h1>DMA and Device Neutrality+++ CRA &amp; PLD vote +++ EU elections: get active</h1>

<body microformats="h-entry">

<p>
Last month, the DMA came into force and we launched a website about 
Device Neutrality, the EU parliament voted the CRA and the PLD, and we 
released a guide to get active for the upcoming EU elections. Check out 
the videos from the devrooms we joined at FOSDEM!

<h3 id="lets-make-device-neutrality-a-reality-in-europe">Let’s make Device Neutrality a reality in Europe!</h3>
<p>
Last 7 March, the Digital Markets Act came into force in the European 
Union. This milestone marks the start of Device Neutrality as a 
tangible reality in the European Union. The FSFE acknowledges the new 
legislation, but we want to remark that this is only the first step, and 
further commitment is necessary! <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240307-01.html">Read this article</a> to dive 
deeper.
</p>
<p>
To raise public awareness concerning Device Neutrality, the FSFE has 
launched <a 
href="https://deviceneutrality.org/">deviceneutrality.org</a>. This site 
points to in-depth insights about Device Neutrality and Free Software, 
downloadable promotional material, and ways to spread the word. Check it 
out!

<h3 id="cra-pld-vote-in-the-european-parliament">CRA &amp; PLD vote in the European Parliament</h3>
<p>
The European Parliament voted on the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and the Product 
Liability Directive (PLD) on 12<sup> </sup>March. Regarding the 
introduction of liability rules for software, a broad exception for Free 
Software was made, so that after long and intense debates individual 
developers and non-profit work are safeguarded. We will therefore 
closely monitor the implementation and whether Software Freedom is 
protected accordingly.

<p>
Once again we co-organised <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240318-01.html">our now well-known Legal &amp; 
Policy Issues Devroom</a>. The discussions in this track covered 
important issues for Software Freedom, such as CRA, RHEL, and GPL 
termination. Furthermore, <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240318-02.html">we helped to organise a 
devroom</a> about Free Software in the European legislative landscape.
</p>
<h3 id="take-action-get-active-for-the-elections-in-the-european-union">Take action: get active for the elections in the European Union!</h3>
<p>
European citizens will hit the ballot boxes from 6 to 9 June 2024 to 
choose their next representatives in the European Parliament. As the 
campaign heats up, it is important to get active and ensure Software 
Freedom is part of the larger political debate.

<h3 id="news-from-zooom">News from ZOOOM</h3>
<p>
As part of its involvement with <a href="https://zooom4u.eu/">the Zooom 
consortium</a>, the FSFE has produced four chapters in two comprehensive 
reports on Free Software <a 
href="https://zooom4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Document_Licensing-Framework_final_PUB.pdf">legal</a> 
and <a 
href="https://zooom4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ZOOOM-D1.1-Licensing-Framework_submitted.pdf">business 
topics</a>. These reports deal with a broad range of topics, and provide 
empirical data on Free Software topics in Europe in relation to critical 
technologies, such as AI. The FSFE also contributed to <a 
href="https://zooom4u.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ZOOOM_PolicyBrief-03_2024-03.pdf">a 
study</a> on how the term “open” has been improperly used to refer to 
AI projects that are not Free Software.
