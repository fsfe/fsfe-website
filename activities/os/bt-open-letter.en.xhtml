    <h1>British Telecom: please include freedom in your new music service</h1>

    <p>Dear BT,</p>

    <p>
      British Telecom is a leader of telecommunication and digital
      content markets, and has a reputation for product innovation.
      Plans recently reported for a new not-for-profit music download
      service<a class="fn" href="#fn-1">1</a> for BT's 5.5 million
      broadband customers have sparked much discussion, and once again
      placed BT at the fore of the future of digital content delivery in
      the UK.
    </p>

    <p>
      Amongst those speculating about the nature of the new service are
      the growing number of BT customers who use Free Software<a
        class="fn" href="#fn-2">2</a> web-browsers, operating systems, and
      multimedia players. Currently these and other Free Software users
      are unable to enjoy many popular content delivery systems such as
      Spotify, Steam, and iTunes, because they are not compatible with
      Free Software, or require the waiving of users' rights and freedoms
      in order to use them<a class="fn" href="#fn-3">3</a> <a class="fn"
        href="#fn-4">4</a> <a class="fn" href="#fn-5">5</a>.  The nature of
      BT's new service, and the extent to which it respects the freedom of
      it's users, are therefore of particular concern.
    </p>

    <p>
      Powerful new Open Standards<a class="fn" hreF="#fn-6">6</a> like
      HTML5 and CSS3, combined with widely used Free Software codecs for
      rich multimedia like VP8 and Ogg Vorbis, make it easier than ever
      to build powerful cross-platform applications which respect user
      freedom whilst maintaining long term accessibility.  Recent
      adoption of these technologies by established content providers
      such as YouTube, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation,
      Dailymotion, and Deutschlandradio, reflect a growing industry
      trend towards platform independence through use of Free Software
      and Open Standards<a class="fn" href="#fn-7">7</a> <a class="fn"
        href="#fn-8">8</a> <a class="fn" href="#fn-9">9</a> <a
        class="fn" href="#fn-10">10</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to these web-based technologies exists Free Software
      tools like Qt and Gtk, which continue to be used by thousands of
      companies<a class="fn" href="#fn-11">11</a> to develop world-class
      desktop applications compatible with all major operating systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      BT already makes wide use of Free Software<a class="fn"
        href="#fn-12">12</a>, and “recognises,
      and welcomes the use of open source software”<a class="fn"
        href="#fn-13">13</a>.  Therefore we
      ask that you recognise the value of your customer's freedom as you
      design and deploy your new subscription service, and take the
      opportunity to benefit from one of the many Free Software
      technologies which will allow you to achieve this.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Free Software Foundation Europe is happy to assist you with
      any questions regarding this issue or Free Software and Open
      Standards in general.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yours Sincerely,
    </p>
