<h1>Nortel patent sale: FSFE defends Free Software, competition</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">Competition authorities in the US and Europe are
  currently investigating the sale of 6000 patents from Nortel,
  a bankrupt telecommunications equipment manufacturer, to a
  consortium of Apple, Microsoft and four other companies. 
</p>
<p>
FSFE believes that the acquisition of these patents by those companies
represents a very serious risk to competition in the mobile technology
space, and to Free Software as a whole. Soon after the sale, we
entered into dialogue with the competition authorities, and in
September submitted a comprehensive summary of our concerns.
</p>
<p>
"There is little information publicly available on the status of
this transaction, but it's encouraging to know that the US
Department of Justice and the European Commission are closely
scrutinising this deal," says FSFE's President, Karsten Gerloff. "Free
Software is crucial to competition in IT, and we are confident that
the authorities will recognise the risk that this transaction poses to
makers of software everywhere, whether their programs are free or
not."
</p>
<p>
FSFE will continue to follow the situation closely as it evolves, and
will work to defend software freedom at every turn.
