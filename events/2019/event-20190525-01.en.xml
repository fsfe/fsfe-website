    <title>FSFE Booth at Corso Leopold Street Festival in Munich, Germany</title>

    <body>
      <p>Corso Leopold is a bi-annual Street Festival on Munich's Leopoldstraße. Because we believe Free Software is an essential part of a Free and Open Society, FSFE Group Munich will be present at Corso Leopold with a booth. We are happy to see Munich's FLOSS community growing further and we feel honored to have our booth next to the booths of several like-minded organizations (digitalcourage e.V, Forum InformatikerInnen für Frieden und gesellschaftliche Verantwortung and Wikipedia e.V.) </p>
      <p>We're looking forward to meet new people as well as old friends, to thought-provoking discussions and to nice conversations.</p>
