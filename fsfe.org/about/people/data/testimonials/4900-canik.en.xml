      Free Software and FSFE is to me: sharing, learning, being independent of
      monopolies, producing things together, passion and freedom! Since I've
      been a Supporter, I am finding new friends who help me in Free Software and
      other topics, teaching new things every day even though we are kilometers
      away. It is magnificent to be in a community that continually supports my
      Free Software passion and motivation!
