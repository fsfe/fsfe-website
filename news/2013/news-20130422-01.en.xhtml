  <h1>German Parliament says: Stop Granting Software Patents</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">The German Parliament, the Bundestag, has passed a
  joint motion against software patents. The resolution urges the
  German government to take steps to limit the granting of patents on
  computer programs.
</p>
<p>
"Software patents are harmful in every way, and make life
unnecessarily difficult for developers and companies", says Karsten
Gerloff, President of the Free Software Foundation Europe. "We urge
the German government to act on this resolution as soon as possible,
and relieve German software businesses from the needless
patent-related costs and risks under which they are currently
suffering."
</p>
<p>
The Parliament has resolved that software should be covered by
  copyright exclusively, ensuring that developers have the right to
  release their work as Free Software.  
</p>
<p>
 <a href="http://fsfe.org/campaigns/swpat/swpat.en.html">software
  patents</a> are illegal under the European Patent
  Convention. Nevertheless, the European Patent Office has granted
  tens of thousands of patents on software.
