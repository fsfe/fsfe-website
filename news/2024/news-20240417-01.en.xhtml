<h1>Are Free Software developers at risk?</h1>

<p>Free Software is everywhere, with studies estimating that it is 
present in about 96% of the applications that we use. But what are the responsibilities and 
liabilities of the Free Software developers? A potential threat to Free 
Software developers looms in the form of an ongoing lawsuit in the UK 
involving Bitcoin and its core developers.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency created in 2009 that operates 
under the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">MIT Free Software 
licence</a>. After its creator disappeared, a 
group of software developers continued to develop Bitcoin 
independently. Currently, Dr. Craig Wright, <a 
href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/14/australian-craig-wright-not-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-high-court-rules">who 
claimed to be the 
creator of Bitcoin</a>, is suing the Bitcoin developers in the UK courts 
through his company, Tulip Trading Limited (Tulip). This company claims 
to have lost	£3 billion worth of bitcoin due to a hack that 
compromised the private keys, resulting in the loss of access to the 
funds. In this lawsuit Tulip is demanding that the Bitcoin developers 
provide access to the lost Bitcoin, arguing that the developers have a 
legal obligation to provide access or offer equitable compensation or 
damages.</p>	

<p>As such, this legal case is currently drawing attention to the issue 
of Free Software developers' liability, in particular the extent to 
which they are responsible to their users.</p> 

<h3>UK High Court’s opinion: Developers have no legal duties or a duty 
of care in this case, but they do have certain duties in some specific 
situations.</h3>

<p>The High Court considered whether software developers and 
controllers of digital asset networks bear legal obligations to 
cryptocurrency holders who rely on their software. <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/legal/documents/first-instance-decision-dismissing-TTL.redacted.pdf">The 
court ruled in 
favour of the developers</a>, stating that as a "fluctuating body of 
individuals", the developers could not realistically maintain ongoing 
obligations. The court rejected the notion that developers should be 
compelled to provide software updates upon the request of digital asset 
owners, emphasising the absence of any explicit commitment or assurance 
by the developers. Regarding the alleged tortious duties, the Court 
determined that the developers did not owe Tulip a duty of care, 
highlighting that Tulip's loss was solely economic.</p>

<blockquote><em>A duty of care is a legal responsibility imposed on an 
individual that requires them to follow a level of reasonable care when 
conducting any acts that could endanger others.</em></blockquote>

<p>However, the court recognized that, in certain cases, <strong>software 
developers have specific duties. For instance, developers must exercise 
caution to avoid harming users' interests and may have an obligation to 
remedy bugs or faults in the system</strong>.</p>
	
<p>The court also acknowledged that <a 
href="https://opensource.org/license/MIT">the disclaimer in the MIT 
license</a>, 
broadly disclaims liability for software issues. However, the court did 
not confirm whether this disclaimer absolved BTC Network developers of 
responsibility for its operation. This is because:</p>
 
<ul>
	<li>the MIT disclaimer has never been litigated, and the court is free to decide and set precedent.</li>
	<li>such disclaimers are not easily found when using software.</li>
</ul>

<h3>UK Court of Appeal’s opinion: Arguable that developers owe some fiduciary legal duties</h3>

<p>On appeal, the Court of Appeal (the second highest court in the UK) 
<a 
href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tulip-v-Van-Der-Laan-judgment-030223.pdf">overturned 
the High Court's decision</a>, concluding that it was at least 
arguable that the developers owe fiduciary legal duties to 
cryptocurrency owners. The court noted the exclusive control of the 
Bitcoin software code by a small group of developers and their 
decision-making role on behalf of all Bitcoin owners, resembling 
fiduciary responsibilities. The court also noted that only a handful of 
developers have exclusive access to the Bitcoin software code on 
GitHub. For example, if a Bitcoin owner notices a bug, he or she is 
unable to fix it because only the developers with access can do so, and 
they have to agree to do so. In the eyes of the court, this is a clear 
exercise of the de facto power of the developers. The court completely 
missed the point that no one can prevent others from applying a fix to 
the code - that is part of the fundamental freedom that comes with Free 
Software: if the developers of a particular repository refuse to apply 
needed fixes, the community can fork the project and bypass those 
developers.</p>
 
<p>Furthermore, code is speech. Freedom of expression includes 
expression in the language of computer code as well. Imposing 
disproportionate duties on Free Software developers forces them to 
change their code, and therefore infringes on their freedom of 
expression. The court also observed that the developers have a 
positive duty to fix bugs and code errors and a negative duty to 
refrain from acting in their own self-interest.</p>

<p>In summary, Tulip's case raises significant legal questions, and 
according to the latest developments, Tulip must prove ownership of the 
alleged stolen bitcoins <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/legal/documents/PRELIMINARY%20ISSUE%20TRIAL.pdf">in 
a preliminary trial</a>.</p>
 

<h3>Chilling effect on Free Software development?</h3> 
<p>Common law in 
the UK (and other countries) is developed through court decisions and 
precedents. When a court makes a decision in a case, it establishes a 
legal precedent that serves as a guide for future cases with similar 
circumstances. Lower courts generally have to follow the precedents set 
by the higher courts. Courts in common law countries tend to also 
borrow concepts and precedents from other countries if there is no local 
precedent available. The law and legal scholarship around Free Software 
developers’ duties is underdeveloped and almost non-existent. If Tulip 
succeeds in their case, it	may set an international legal precedent, 
opening the floodgates to litigation. This means that any user of Free 
Software could potentially sue developers for alleged breaches of duty.</p> 

<blockquote><em>A fiduciary duty, as claimed by Tulip, refers to the legal 
duty of a person or entity to act in the best interests of another 
party, typically referred to as the beneficiary or principal. This duty 
is characterized by trust, confidence, and reliance on the fiduciary to 
act ethically and responsibly on behalf of the beneficiary. Fiduciary 
duties exist in only very specific relationships, like those of 
trustees, solicitors, agents, partners, and company directors. 
Attaching these duties to Free Software developers is unprecedented and 
disproportionate.</em></blockquote>

<p>Free Software production, a catalyst for technological innovation, 
relies on voluntary contributions. Imposing fiduciary duties (or any 
disproportionate duties) on developers could deter them from 
participating in Free Software projects, fearing legal repercussions. 
This could lead to a chilling effect, where developers opt for more 
restrictive licensing, or refrain from sharing their code altogether, 
or release the software only in jurisdictions where there are no duties	
out of fear of litigation. The results of such an effect would be 
disastrous; stifling innovation and potentially halting the progress of 
specific Free Software endeavours.</p>

<p>In essence, if the court rules in favour of Tulip, it can have 
far-reaching consequences that can be detrimental to the Free Software 
developers in the following ways:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Courts may impose an active duty on Free Software developers to fix 
what the courts deem to be problematic issues.</li> 
	<li>In future courts may impose an active duty on Free Software 
developers to not cause any bugs that impact users. This can 
potentially expose the developers to litigation for just letting 
through a bug or failing to spot a bug. </li>
	<li>Courts may also impose obligations on Free Software developers that 
require them to compromise the cryptographic integrity guarantees of 
the software. This could involve mandates to weaken encryption 
algorithms or provide backdoor access, directly undermining the 
security measures designed to protect user privacy and data 
confidentiality. Such orders would not only compromise the 
effectiveness of encryption software but also the tools such as secure 
file deletion or data recovery.</li> 
</ol>

<p>Free Software development thrives on the collaborative efforts of 
developers worldwide, continually evolving. The developers’ autonomy 
inherent in Free Software must not be jeopardized by the fear of unjust 
litigation. FSFE remains vigilant in safeguarding against threats to 
developer autonomy that could stifle innovation. In the light of 
these concerns, we call upon the developers to persist in their 
invaluable work without fear.</p>
