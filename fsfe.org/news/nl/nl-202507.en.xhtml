<h3 id="quote-of-the-month">Quote of the Month</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>“Coming together with fellow volunteers and staff at the Software 
		Freedom Flat in Berlin this summer filled me with joy and hope. 
		Sharing stories, ideas, and laughter with people who care so deeply 
		about software freedom always reminds me why I do this work and it 
		recharges my FSFE batteries. It was especially exciting to meet some 
		people for the first time – your presence meant a lot. I left feeling 
		energized, and I can’t wait to see everyone again and welcome even 
		more next time.”</p>
		<cite>Florain Snow, FSFE volunteer.</cite>

<h3 id="dma">DMA: tell us how gatekeepers are handling your 
interoperability requests</h3> <p>Free Software developers: your voice 
 is needed! The FSFE has launched the <a href="/activities/deviceneutrality/interop-survey">DMA Interoperability 
 Survey</a>, aimed 
 at collecting crucial input from Free Software developers who have 
 tried, or plan to try, to request interoperability from companies like 
 Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon under Article 6(7) of the DMA.</p> 

<p>We want to monitor how gatekeepers are handling the interoperability 
requests submitted by Free Software developers. We want to hear the 
developers’ experiences and to make sure their voices are heard when 
gatekeepers fall short of their obligations.</p>

<p>If you are a Free Software developer and made or plan to make an 
interoperability request under Article 6(7) of the DMA, we need your 
help! Whether your request was successful, delayed, denied, or ignored: 
your insights are valuable. Please, <a href="/activities/deviceneutrality/interop-survey">take a look at the 
survey or share 
it</a> with anyone for whom this might be relevant. </p>


<h3 id="spf">SFP#35: Policy and EU: Tech sovereignty vote in the ITRE 
Committee</h3> <p>Our episode number 35 of the Software Freedom Podcast 
 comes with our monthly update on policy decisions, votes and 
 discussions in the European Union! Together Bonnie Mehring and 
 Alexander Sander talk about one specific policy topic in regard to Free 
 Software. This month they sat down and covered the vote on the Tech 
 sovereignty INI in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy 
 (ITRE). </p>

<h3 id="yh4f">"YH4F provides teenagers with a platform to 
express their ideas and develop skills that are crucial for their 
future careers"</h3> 

<p>The 2025 Youth Hacking 4 Freedom programming 
period came to an end at the end of June, marking the start of the 
evaluation phase. Among the jury members is Alexios Zavras, who has 
been involved since the very first edition of the contest. Let us hear 
his insights on the YH4F competition and what motivates him to be part 
of the jury. </p>

<h3 id="ada">Ada &amp; Zangemann: thanks to our 
volunteers we can now enjoy the book and the movie in Danish!</h3> 
<p>You should know by now: our volunteers are really amazing! Thanks to our 
Danish local group, the story of Ada &amp; Zangemann can be also found 
in Danish in both the book and the movie.</p>

<p>The Danish translation as 
well as the voice recording for the film was done on a voluntary basis 
by Øjvind Fritjof Arnfred, and the production of the Danish edition of 
the film was kindly sponsored by PROSA (the Danish IT Worker's Union) 
and David Heinemeier Hansson. The Danish version of the 
film had its premiere on March 27, 2025, in the cinema Øst for Paradis 
in Århus – followed by a Q&amp;A and debate with the author, FSFE 
President Matthias Kirschner. The book was officially 
published on June 16, 2025, on which day an official book launch and a 
second screening of the film took place in the Empire Cinema in 
Copenhagen – followed by a Q&amp;A with the translator and a panel 
discussion about 
digital sovereignty through Free Software featuring, among others, FSFE 
Senior Policy Project Manager Johannes Näder. </p> <p>Learn more about 
 the publishing process through <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/agger/2025/06/24/on-publishing-ada-zangemann-in-danish/">the 
 blog post of Carsten Agger</a>, one of the volunteers behind this.</p>

<h3 id="conferences">From the stages to your 
screen: videos from the latest conferences</h3> <p>We really enjoy 
 attending conferences, and over the past few weeks, we’ve been quite 
 busy. The recordings from our talks at <a href="http://DevConf.CZ/">DevConf.CZ</a> 2025 in Brno, <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/irrxN1PpocEB4FjD34cQxC">DORS/CLUC 
 2025</a>, and the <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/jmVohZ4nE6p93rWnzkmt6e">openSUSE 2025 
 Conference</a> are already online and can be watched at <a href="http://media.fsfe.org/">media.fsfe.org</a>. We also attended 
 T-DOSE, MERGE-It, and OpenSouthCode!</p> 


<p>On the last 
weekend of June, we also celebrated our annual FSFE Summer Meeting with 
some of our volunteers in Berlin. It was a pleasure to spend time with 
some of you there, although we also missed others who couldn’t make 
it.</p> <p>The 2025 Summer Meeting took place at the Software Freedom 
 Flat, where we had interesting discussions about our current projects 
 and our volunteers’ work, as well as amazing food and Italian homemade 
 ice cream!</p>
