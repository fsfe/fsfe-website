    <h3>Terms of usage</h3>

    <p>
     You may use the FSFE logo as part of the logo of your local FSFE group
     or FSFE team and to promote activities your group or team
     organizes.  For example, if your local FSFE group runs a booth, you may
     use the logo.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, at events not organized by the FSFE directly or a local
     FSFE group, speakers representing the FSFE may use the logo to clearly
     show the affiliation of the speaker.  That does not mean you can use the
     logo in a way that makes it seem as if the FSFE is endorsing the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, the logo of the FSFE must never be used in a way that
      could be understood as endorsing certain activities, home pages,
      products or entities not organized by an FSFE team or local group,
      unless you get prior consent from the FSFE.  If in doubt, please
      contact
      &lt;<a href="mailto:contact@fsfe.org?subject=Logo">contact@fsfe.org</a>&gt;
      if you wish to know whether your intended usage is suitable and whether
      you can use it in a certain context.
    </p>
