          democracy, transparency, pluralism, consistency, reliability and
          focus. Both enable people to solve important problems together. I also

          possibilities. I discovered free software at university, and since
          then a whole world has unfolded for me; and it is there, waiting to be
          used and waiting for another contributor. With free software I have
          done something that, before, I did much less: learning! I have learned
          not only more about computer science but also valuable skills for my
          studies and my job. So I have to say a big "Thank you" to all the

          "As a web designer I spend most of the time working on computers.
          Usability is a big issue for me. And a very important part of
          usability is the compliance with well defined open standards because
          every program can be built to support these norms. It's insane not
          comply with them if you want to provide a diverse audience with a
          certain design and a clear and reliable interaction. Free software is
          built around open standards. Unfortunately big proprietary software
          vendors ignore those standards building solutions which work for their
          own products only. I don't want to support this greed and take a stand
          for reasoning and cooperation by using free software and supplying
          media in formats which can be accessed freely without the need to
          accept unfavourable limitations."

          important, be free to learn always something from other fellows is
          important, be free to teach always something to other fellows is
          important. All of this is possible only with Free Software, and since
          I joined the cause, I couldn't live without anymore. Linux, Ubuntu,
          Gnome, LibreOffice, Gimp, Blender, Chromium, just to name few, and
          many more free software that I use every day, allows me do what I
          want, in the way I want. No matter if I have to write a document, do
          some calculations, write software code, create some graphics, or
          simply enjoy a game or watch a film. Free Software it's always there
          with a simple and effective solution for me in any field."

          their love to projects such as Audacity, GIMP, Inkscape and other
          audiovisual tools. These tools form the backbone of the infrastructure
          needed to support free culture and while Free Culture could
          technically exist independently of Free Software, the two movements
          share a common philosophy of freedom which make the two inseparable.
          Without Free Software, our activities would be so much more difficult
          to carry out, and no Free Culture project would be able to enjoy the
          full freedoms without the infrastructure created by Free Software

          "Free Software is central to everything KDE does and without Free
          Software KDE software could not exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          KDE relies overwhelmingly on volunteer contributions from people
          all around the world who, initially, do not know one another. Free
          Software provides the social contract that makes such contributions
          possible, as our volunteers know they are helping to create a common
          good that can be shared by all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Free Software and the shared purpose it creates also gives KDE its
          distinctive non-hierarchical meritocratic structure. Without the
          principles of Free Software, KDE would need centralised control of the
          software copyrights and, in turn, a set of leaders determining the
          direction of the software we produce. Our contributors would have less
          ability to try out new ideas, to work on the things that really matter
          to them and, above all, to be Free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without Free Software, there would be no KDE. Free Software gives KDE
          life. KDE loves Free Software."
