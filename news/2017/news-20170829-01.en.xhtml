  <h1>Digital-O-Mat: Compare your views on digital issues with the parties for the German federal election</h1>

	<p newsteaser="yes">Even as digital issues are becoming more important every day, the election coverage does not give them the attention they deserve. That is why Koalition Freies Wissen created "Digital-O-Mat", an online tool for voter information for the German federal election of 2017. The FSFE asked the participating partis for their positions on Free Software. While CDU/CSU (Christian Democrats), SPD (Social Democrats) and FDP (Free Democrats) avoid clear statements and thus ultimately cement the status quo, the Greens and the Left present themselves as supporters of the deployment and public development of Free Software.</p>

	<h3>What is Digital-O-Mat?</h3>

<a href="http://bund.digital-o-mat.de/">Digital-O-Mat</a> highlights the parties' positions on Free Software and helps voters find a matching party for the election to the German parliament. Its design resembles the well-known Wahl-O-Mat. Users of Digital-O-Mat are able to answer twelve questions and then compare their position to the participating parties. The topics of Digital-O-Mat include transparency, surveillance digital civil rights and, of course, Free Software. We asked AfD (Alternative for Germany), Bündnis 90/Die Grünen (Greens), CDU (Christian Democrats), CSU (Christian Socialists), FDP (Free Democrats), Die Linke (The Left) and the SPD (Social Democrats). We received replies from everyone except AfD. <a href="https://github.com/dsstio/digital-o-mat">Digital-O-Mat is Free Software</a> and had its debut in 2017 for the <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2017/news-20170419-01">state parliament elections in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany)</a>.</p>

	<h3>The parties' positions on Free Software</h3>


	<p>For Digital-O-Mat, FSFE asked the participating parties the following questions:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>If software is financed or co-financed by the public sector, should there be no regulation regarding its licensing, e.g. a Free Software licence?</li>
		  <li>Should public administrations gradually migrate their IT systems to Free and Open Source software?</li>
		</ul>

	<p>CDU/CSU and FDP marked their position as "neutral" and answered in a very similar fashion. Unfortunately, these parties still do not understand the significance of Free Software and try to avoid clear statements. According to them, while they do consider the use of Free Software, this should be weighed against many other aspects. They cite functionality and usability, even though they have no relation to the used licence. When asked about the migration of existing IT systems, CDU/CSU prefer decision making on a case-by-case basis, while FDP dodged our question. </p>

	<p>Though SPD also marked their answer as "neutral", they support they do support the deployment and development in public administrations and educational institutions, "to foster the creation of innovative businesses in the local market". The Left and the Greens clearly position themselves as supporters of both deployment and public funding of Free Software. The Greens view Free Software as a "cornerstone for secure and future-proof IT systems", and the also fully support it, "as long as there are no concerns regarding security or operation."  </p>
