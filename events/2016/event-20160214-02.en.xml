   <title>I Love Free Software Day 2016</title>

   <body>Free Software contributors enable us to use the freedom tools we appreciate every day. Developers, designers, translators, and many more deserve our gratitude. Let's say "thank you" to them on the traditional day of love, Valentine's Day. Unlike usual events IloveFS is an online event only. Have a look at the website to see how you can celebrate with us.
