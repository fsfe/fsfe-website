            <p>
	      The 7th edition of the Free Software Forum (FISL) will once more take place in Porto Alegre,
              Brazil and also host the second international conference on GPLv3. FSFE will be
              represented at this event by its president, Georg Greve, and FSFE's Brussels representative,
              Ciaran O'Riordan. Both will speak at the GPLv3 event, and participate during the main FISL event:
               Georg Greve will give one of the opening talks, titled 
              "Free Software - Social Movement or Technological
              Revolution?" and Ciaran O'Riordan will talk about work against software patents. Both will
              also work with FSFE's sister association, the FSF Latin America and meet the local Free Software community
              to strengthen the international Free Software network.
