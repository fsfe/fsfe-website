		<h2 id="llw2018">LLW2018: The FSFE brings together top legal experts to debate about legal and licensing issues around Free Software</h2>
	
	<p>Following a more than a decade long tradition, the FSFE once again led its annual <a href="/activities/ln/llw.html">Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop</a> (LLW) in Barcelona, Spain, as a meeting point for world-leading legal experts to debate over issues and best practices surrounding Free Software licences. This year we decided to bring the event back to its roots and to emphasise the "Workshop" part in its original title. Our 3-day conference attracted around 120 legal experts and came with an unprecedented amount of parallel tracks and interactive sessions designed to dive into the most contentious topics in the legal world of Free Software.</p>
	
	<p>Some of the topics covered during the conference included an update on how to build a successful <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/752485/">legal defense strategy</a> against a copyright troll, recommendations on how to tackle <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/752982/">challenges of compliance in container images</a>, as well as an overview of what decades of Free Software licensing can teach us in <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/753648/">data sharing</a>. A more detailed report of this important event is to come during the next weeks.</p>

	<h2 id="the-fsfe-community-as-a-case-study-for-research">The FSFE community as a case study</h2>

	<p>Since more than 15 years, the FSFE is an enduring non-profit organisation with a distributed network of people, who contribute their time and effort into <a href="/about/mission">our common mission</a> to empower users to control technology. That is why <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/poderi/?p=38">Giacomo Poderi chose the FSFE community</a> as one of his cases for his research in the <a href="http://poderi.eu/research/issp/">“Infrastructuring SuStainable Playbour“ (ISSP) project</a>. This project investigates the sustainability of collaborative spaces, as commons, and it focuses on participants’ continuous contribution to the maintenance and development of such ‘places’.</p>

	<p>If you are contributing or contributed in the past to the FSFE's mission and you feel fine with being interviewed, please get in touch with Giacomo Poderi. No automated data gathering is involved in this research and no sensitive data are expected to be collected. Furthermore, anonymity of participants will be preserved in any dissemination activity related to this research.</p>
