      <p>
        As a non-profit, non-governmental organisation, Free Software
        Foundation Europe works to create general understanding and
        support for Free Software and Open Standards. The following
        activities are concrete actions that we take in the areas of
        public awareness, policy advocacy and legal support.

    <p>
      Since its foundation in 2001, the FSFE has been working every
      single day to further Free Software in Europe and beyond. A major
      part of our work consists of continuous engagement like being
      present at dozens of conferences per year, supporting and
      maintaining an excellent community and supprting it with various
      resources, and being a prominent contact point for questions and
      enquiries.

    <p>
      However, with our concrete activities we focus on protecting and
      extending specific user rights in different areas. Some of our
      actions run for many years, some are aimed at short-term
      developments. A connecting element is the focus on the <a
      href="/about/ourwork.html">three pillars of our work</a> and the
      strong dedication to our mission: empower people to control
      technology.
