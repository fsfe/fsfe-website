  <h2 class="painted">The basics</h2>

  <p>It does not matter if you already have <a href="">upcycled your phone</a> by installing a Custom-ROM or if you still use an Android stock ROM: discover the world of Free Software on your mobile device by replacing one app after the other - or all in one. To help you in this process we recommend to get in touch with other people who follow the same idea and to share knowledge and exchange best practices with them. This can be in real life our you join one of the many online communities. To help you with the steps and an outlook on where your journey can go we list some of the most popular Free Software apps on this page with a peak of information about what they can help you with. We encourage you to start a rewarding path to freedom.</p>

  <h2 class="painted">Use F-Droid as your app store</h2>

  <p>
    Luckily, the Google Play Store is not the only source to obtain apps for your Android devices. Luckily because there are several issues with the Google Play Store: It offers you non-free and intransparent software, let alone the fact that using Google Play Store also requires a Google account and Google software that continuously spies on you and tracks your behaviour. It is recommended to not use this market at all. 
        </p>

    <div class="infoitem">
      <h3 id="Fdroid">F-Droid</h3>
      <div class="with-image-left">
        <img alt="F-Droid logo" src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/thumb/e50bafbaaf03067800de118043ed2ee5.jpeg" />
      <p>
        The <a href="http://f-droid.org/">F-Droid initiative</a> introduced an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform. It builds a repository of easily-installable Free Software apps for the Android platform. There is an Android client application that makes it easy to browse Free Software applications, install them onto your device, and keep track of updates.
      </p>

      <p>The F-Droid store has many benefits in comparison to the Google Play store: It only offery you Free Software apps, no account is needed and you can use it anonymously. There are no hidden costs and the store is transparent about any <a href="https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/AntiFeatures">antifeatures</a> an app contains.</p>

      <p>If you have installed a Custom-ROM and you like to avoid Google after all, the best option is to install F-Droid and get your apps from there. If you still have your default Android installed, we recommend to look which app you can better install via the F-Droid store instead of the non-free Google Play Store (you will see that many apps are available in both stores) and what other interesting apps you find in F-Droid that you do not find in the Google store. To get you started we created the list below with some recommendation.</p>

  <h2 class="painted">Use Aurora to replace Google</h2>

      <p>Description of how you can use Aurora to install apps from the Google and why it matters: Sadly, not all Free Software apps are in F-Droid. If you need an app, that's available in the Google Play Store, but not in F-Droid, you can use the Free Software App called Aurora, that is (<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/">available for download in F-droid</a>). Aurora is in App store that allows you to gets get Apps that are only availabe in the Google Play Store, but in a more private way and being able to see the license of the App before you download it (in Google Play you cannot).</p>

    <p>
      Nowadays, we fortunately live in a world in which we can choose from
      various Free Software apps for almost any use case. This section aims
      to present a small selection of apps which are fitting for
      starters. By no means can such a list be ever perfect for every individual
      case. We also recommend you to look at the complete <a

    <p>You do not need to use Google Maps on your phone. Instead you can use maps free of advertisement, without spying on your location and completely offline. These apps usually use <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreet Map</a> which is like the Wikipedia for maps: Anyone can edit it and all together create the most advanced map available.Two of such apps - the most common - we have listed below and there are many more out there.</p>
