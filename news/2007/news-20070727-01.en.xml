    <title>FSFE offers to help companies adhere to Free Software licence
    terms</title>
    <body>
        The terms of the GNU GPL licence have been confirmed as binding
	once again, with a German court ruling that Skype was failing 
	to uphold its obligations as a distributor.  FSFE wants to help
	other vendors understand their GNU GPL obligations.
