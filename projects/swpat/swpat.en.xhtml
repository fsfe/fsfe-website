    <title>FSF Europe - Software Patents in Europe</title>

      <center><h1>Software Patents in Europe</h1></center>
      <p>
        The European Patent Convention (published 1973) explicitly states that
        the field of <i>programs for computers</i>, i.e. software, is excluded
        from patentability.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is reason behind this: while a program in its concrete form is
        protected from plagiarism by copyright law, a patent would protect the
        mathematical and logical methods used by the program. Therefore, a
        patent would manifest a monopoly of specific calcuation methods, would
        make mathematical laws, logical rules and business processes the suable
        propriety of companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The United States of America have already traced out the path: Since
        software patents are legal there, it came to a flood of patent
        applications by big companies. They can easily come up with a suit for
        patent infrigment against any small or medium enterprise trying to get
        into the software market, and the unpleasant competitor is ruined due
        to the high process costs, or it is simply bought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currentyl, Europe highly profits from the burden the U.S. has put upon
        themselves: the small and medium software companies have made Europe a
        central player in innovation, while in the U.S., innovative software
        development is limited to a few monopolists.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the European Union faces a growing pressure from the outside
        to allow software patents like the U.S. does. On the one hand, the
        European Patent Office (which is not controlled by any government or
        the EU) has granted about 30,000 software patents <i>despite the fact
        they are disallowed by the European Patent Convention</i>, on the other
        hand, a directive on the "patentability of computer implemented
        inventions" is being prepared with the intent to legalize those
        (granted, but currently not legally valid) patents.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Status</h2>

      <p>
        The European Commission's original proposal for the directive, which
        has been heavily criticised, would have allowed unlimited patenting of
        software, calcuation rules and business processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        September 24, 2003 the European Parliament (which is elected directly
        by the people in the EU) voted on the commission's proposal. The
        Members of the Parliament decided to pass a heavily modified version of
        the directive which would prevent patentability of pure abstract
        software without a technical context. This decision to value the needs
        of European economy higher than the wishes of the excessively lobbying
        global companies was widely regarded as a victory for democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Die Entscheidungsprozesse in der Europäischen Union sind ausgesprochen
        kompliziert und aufwändig. Nach der Entscheidung des Parlamentes ist
        nun der Ministerrat an der Reihe, dem Parlament zuzustimmen oder einen
        Gegenvorschlag zu präsentieren. Allerdings scheinen in diesem Gremium
        die Befürworter grenzenloser Patentierbarkeit eine sehr starke Position
        zu haben. Nach einer monatelangen Verschleppung der Sache wurde nun
        hinter verschlossenen Türen ein sogenannter "Kompromiss" ausgearbeitet,
        der in Wirklichkeit inhaltlich mit der ursprünglichen, vom Parlament
        abgelehnten Fassung völlig übereinstimmt.<br />
        The decision process in the European Union is very complex. After the
        parliament's decision, it's the turn of the council to agree with the
        parliament or to present a counterproposal. Unfortunately, the
        supporters of unlimited patentability seem to have a strong position in
        the council. After having delayed the issue for months, the council has
        now prepared a so-called "compromise" which is essentially identical
        with the original proposal that was rejected by the parliament.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Permanent Representatives Committee (COREPER), which prepares the
        decisions of the council and is bound to directives from the national
        governments, has already accepted this version. The directive proposal
        will be decided on by the council on May 17 without further discussion.
        It looks very much like the council will accept this proposal to allow
        unlimited patentability of software.
      </p>

      <h2>The Most Important Items Of The Directive</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>General patentability of software:</b>
          While the version that the European Parliament agreed upon negates
          the general patentability of software and only allowes software
          patent in a very limited way for clearly defined exceptions, the
          council's version declares a general patentability of software and
          tries to calm down critics by fictitious restrictions that can be
          circumvented in praxis without problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Interoperability:</b>
          The European Parliament states in its version of the directive that
          data exchange or data conversion ("interoperability") can never
          constitute a patent infrigment. The council wants to strike out this
          rule and therefore allow patenting and monopolizing file formats.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Definition of "technical":</b>
          The version of the parliament defines clearly that only technical
          inventions are patentable, and defines the word "technical" as
          "applying of nature forces". Opposed to that, the council did not
          only strike out the definition of "technical", it also decided that
          inventions should also be patentable if they show <i>no technical
            progress at all</i>!
        </li>
      </ul>
