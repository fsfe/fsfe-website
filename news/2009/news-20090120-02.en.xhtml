<h1>Web browser interoperability: <br />FSFE welcomes EC's decision and offers support</h1>

<p>On the 16th of January the European Commission DG Competition reported
that it had issued a statement of objections regarding Microsoft's
tying of Internet Explorer (IE) to the Windows Operating System
product family.  This action builds on a complaint originally
submitted by Opera, a European company involved in web browser
development.</p>

<p>Free Software Foundation Europe welcomes the European Commission's
decision and offers its support in the coming anti-trust
investigation.  As stated previously in a letter to the European
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, anti-competitive behaviour is
unacceptable, whether it occurs as 'tying' products with dominant
market segments, or in circumventing standards and fair access.</p>

<p>"Web browsers are becoming a critical platform for home and business
computing," says Shane Coughlan, legal coordinator at FSFE. "The
market previously failed to prevent unfair distortion of the desktop
environment and we cannot allow such practices to be repeated."</p>

<p>"It is important that no business in Europe is allowed to institute
any policy of embracing, extending and extinguishing competition
either through manipulation of interoperability information or through
abuse of a dominant position by unfair tying and bundling of
products," says Georg Greve, FSFE President.  "Microsoft is a company
that has previously been convicted of market distortion in the Work
Group Server market, and we would welcome if the Commission also took
up the antitrust complaint initially lodged in early 2006 by the
European Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS) regarding market
abuse in other areas."</p>
