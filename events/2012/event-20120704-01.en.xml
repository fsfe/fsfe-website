  <title>PDF readers sprint at Akademy 2012</title>
   <body>
    <p>
     On July 4th, FSFE Fellow Heiki "Repentinus" Ojasild will host a PDF
     readers sprint in Tallinn, Estonia, at
     <a href="https://akademy.kde.org/">Akademy 2012</a>, the KDE summit.
     Everyone is invited to partake and help locate, remove, and replace
     advertisements for proprietary software on the websites of public
     bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
     The event is part of our
     <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/pdfreaders.html">effort</a>
     to stop public bodies from restricting the users' freedom and unfairly
     distorting the competition in favour of certain proprietary software
     makers. As part of the event, participants will be introduced to
     finding offending sites, contacting offending sites, listing offending
     sites on our web site, and keeping track of responses to the memoranda
     to offenders.
