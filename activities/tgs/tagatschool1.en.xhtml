      <h1>TUX&amp;GNU@school - 1st edition</h1>

      <p><i>This is the first of approximately 3 editions of the
      column "TUX&amp;GNU@school". I will report every month about
      a piece of free education software, a website on the topic
      and an idea for an useful program for school purposes. This
      month I talk about <a href="http://edu.kde.org/ktouch">KTouch
      [1]</a>, a KDE program for learning touch writing, <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org">edu.kde.org [2]</a>, the homepage
      of the KDE edutainment project and the idea
      "multiplication-table worksheets generated easily".</i></p>

      <p>After servers, GNU/Linux and Free Software in general
      conquer more and more desktops too. Till recently, they
      lacked of two important software scopes to exist on the
      desktop: On the one hand these are first class computer games
      and on the other hand this is education software.
      Approximately half a year ago two colleaques and me founded
      the <a href="http://www.edux.ch">ALIS - Arbeitsgruppe Linux
      an Schulen (Swiss work group for linux at school) [3]</a>
      whose goal it is helping schools using GNU/Linux and Free
      Software and help them with words and deeds. In this context
      I became concious that almost nobody reported about free
      education software and so, as a big fan of the <a
      href="http://www.brave-gnu-world.org">Brave GNU World
      [4]</a>, from now on I want to report about free software and
      GNU/Linux at and for schools monthly (at the moment for the
      next three month til July). Depending on what's the feedback
      and appeal I will pursue after July. With this in mind every
      kind of feedback, criticism, questions and more are gladly <a
      href="mailto:foxman@lugo.ch">read [5]</a>.</p>

      <p>But now let's continue with the first piece of free
      education software.</p>

      <h3>KTouch - Touch typing learned easily</h3>

      <p>KTouch is a program for KDE which helps learning touch
      writing. It's already available in version 1.0 and was lately
      continued with KDEedu incorporated in <a
      href="http://www.kde.org">KDE 3.0 [6]</a>. I tested it under
      Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (testing) with KDE 2.2 and XFree86
      4.1.0.</p>

      <p>Essentially the interface of KTouch is divided into four
      sections (see screenshot 1). Upmost there is the menu bar
      located listing the following items: <i>File</i>,
      <i>Option</i> <i>Settings</i> and <i>Help</i>. Right under it
      there is the status bar showing from left to right, on which
      level you practise, how many strokes a minute you make, how
      much percent of the already entered words or letters were
      correct, which new letters are introduced in the current
      level and quite right there is an break button disconnecting
      the lesson. Beneath it goes on with the doublespaced bar
      showing the to typing text in the first and the typed text in
      the second row. When you make a mistake the second row
      changes color into red and you see instantly that you have to
      erase some characters. In the last and largest sections the
      keyboard is drawn. This is fairly colored, large and clear.
      Scaling the program window up the layout is adapting itself
      optimally to the size of the window.</p>

      <p><img src="./img/ktouch.en.png"

      border="0" /><br />
      </p>

      <h5>Screenshot 1: KTouch in action</h5>
      <br />
      <br />
       Under <i>File-&gt;Open</i> it is easily possible to start
      lessons for other languages and keyboards. Already available
      are lessons for the languages: German, English, French and
      Norwegian plus a lesson for the numbers block (see screenshot
      2). By the way it is very easy to write new lessons, these
      are saved in simple text files of course. For this purpose
      there is an own chapter in the documentation explaining how
      to do it. Furthermore you can set different keyboard layouts
      under <i>Option-&gt;Keyboard</i> of course. These are saved
      only in text files as well and it is relatively easy possible
      to add new one. General settings as the font style, color or
      sound are adjustable under <i>Option-&gt;General</i>. Some
      further settings for the exercise course respectively the
      level are manageable under <i>Option-&gt;Training</i>. <br />
      <br />

      </p>

      <h5>Screenshot 2: The number block</h5>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p>It's very simple to learn typewriting with this program
      first of all because the keys for each finger are marked with
      the same color. All that keys you have to push right now are
      also marked. But what I still missing is a description for
      each lesson guiding one and give one a short introduction for
      each new key and finger. In the interview, published perhaps
      one week ago, the author of KTouch says that this should be
      one of the next items he want to implement. Incidentally the
      interview arose in context with the choice to the <a
      href="http://www.kde.de/appmonth/2002/ktouch/index-script.php">
      "Anwendung des Monat" (Application of the month)</a> on <a
      href="http://www.kde.de">KDE.de [8]</a>, the German portal of
      KDE. Beyond stays to say that the next version, released with
      KDE 3.0, has already a statistic function making it possible
      to regard more on the own results with the lessons.</p>

      <p>But now continues to the home of KTouch.</p>

      <h3>edu.kde.org - The KDE Edutainment project</h3>

      <p>The KDE Edutainment project is the gate to the world of
      the KDE education software. Since version 3.0 of the K
      Desktop Environment KDEedu is one of its standard packages.
      The homepage enqueues itself seamlessly in the bank of
      &lt;KDE-theme&gt;.kde.org sites. It is build very clear with
      a navigation bar at the left side dividing the whole, namely
      <i>Learn</i>, <i>Software</i>, <i>Contributed Resources</i>,
      <i>Develop</i> and <i>Contact</i> in 5 sections The page is
      at the moment available in English only. You will be
      explained right on the front page KDEedu want to develop free
      education software for kids and teenagers between 3 and 18
      (and older) which is integrated in KDE optimally. Underneath
      there are listed the news, mostly a link to the monthly
      released newsletter which reports about how the project and
      the single programs are evolving.</p>

      <p>In the second part, <i>Learn</i>, you principally find
      information about KDE education software and how you generate
      it most suitable and in the best way. In a second item
      suggestions are published giving programmers a first idea for
      a new piece of education software. Following hereon the
      already existing KDE education programs are introduced with a
      short description and a small screenshot. Then they list
      links to known and related sites on the topic and a todo
      section which informs what's not yet done. But this section
      is no longer up to date because they implemented already some
      of the items. The last item contains links to the newsletters
      you can subscribe to right there.</p>

      <p>The second item divides the software into categories. And
      these are <i>Astronomy</i>, <i>Chemistry</i>,
      <i>Languages</i>, <i>Mathematics</i>, <i>Miscellaneous</i>
      and <i>Plannig</i>. <i>Astronomy</i> contains the very
      extensive program <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org/kstars">KStars</a> which shows the
      nightly starry sky with some 10'000 objects and gives
      additional information too. The application <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org/kalzium">Kalzium</a> belongs to
      <i>Chemistry</i> offering an informative and clear
      presentation of the Periodic Table of the Elements. <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org/khangman">KHangMan</a> and <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org/kmessedwords">KMessedWords</a> are
      two games which let children learn new words playfully. At
      the moment in the section <i>Languages</i> are still a lot of
      programs occupying with a specific language or helping you to
      learn expressions from another language. Here the tendency
      goes partly in the direction of integration of the single
      applications what seems to make sense. In the second last
      part of the already implemented programs they talk about
      mathematical applications as e.g. <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org/kgeo">KGeo</a>, a program for the
      simplified presentation and construction of geometric
      drawings. Further are available: <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org/kbruch">KBruch</a>, <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org/kmplot">KmPlot</a>, <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org/kmathtool">KMathTool</a>, <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org/kpercentage">KPercentage</a> and <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org/ktimes">KTimes</a>. Under
      <i>Miscellaneous</i> you then can find too <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org/keduca">KEduca</a>, a programm for
      the generation of small tests and <a
      href="http://edu.kde.org/ktouch">KTouch</a>, a hopefully
      already known piece of software ;-).</p>

      <p><img src="./img/kdeedu.en.png"
      alt="Screenshot 3: KDE Edutainment" width="800" height="600"
      border="0" /><br />
      </p>

      <h5>Screenshot 3: KDE Edutainment</h5>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p>Under <i>Contributed Resources</i> the interested <a
      href="http://www.haecksen.org">Haeckse</a> finds first
      graphics and images of funny animals and materials. Actually
      an KDEedu contributor offers the generation of 3D images at
      programmers option. But there are sounds and noises to
      utilise for someone, too. But I think the people of KDEedu
      would surely be happy if someone adds anymore creative stuff
      to the already existing one. So you don't have to implicitly
      be a programmer contributing to Free Software. In the last
      item of this section there is still an download facility for
      vocabulary lists applicable in the actuel KDEedu
      application.</p>

      <p>In the fourth and last larger section they show an
      specific interest in the development and programming of free
      education software. They explain topics such as the access to
      CVS and how education programs should be built. For artists
      too there are more fillips here. A link to the <a
      href="http://develop.kde.org">developer homepage of KDE</a>
      [9] guides the interested programmer directly to the center
      of the KDE development.</p>

      <p>In the last item you find a still more detailed list of
      the developers and contributors of the project with more
      information and the email adresses of them. The last links
      guides then to the two available mailing lists.</p>

      <p>If you can see a very informative website. But what I
      still miss are the translations in numberous languages, not
      only for the homepage, but for the education programs as
      well. Though this shouldn't be a negative criticism for the
      KDEedu project but more a hint that it isn't nowhere more
      important and perhaps more difficult to translate the content
      into the different world languages. Nevertheless a large
      "thank you" and a lot of success in the future to the
      developers and contributors of the KDE Edutainment
      project.</p>

      <p>But now continues to the last item of this edition.</p>

      <h3>"Multiplication-table worksheets generated easily"</h3>

      <p>At this place I'll always present an own or the idea of a
      reader. Mostly this will be a tool relatively easy to
      implement and ease the everyday life for teachers and pupils.
      I will always describe the tool as extensive and detailed as
      possible and then hope that one or more reader will implement
      it and I always can report about the tool in one of the next
      editions. In this edition I want to talk about the idea
      "Multiplication-table worksheets generated easily":</p>

      <p>At primary school the multiplication-table belongs to the
      most important things in mathematics and teachers use for
      this task mostly worksheets at least at my school time. The
      simple multiplication has to be automated and as this it's
      very important to solve as much calcules as possible. Mostly
      the used sheets contain columns with exercises of the simple
      multiplication (til 12 multiplied by 12).</p>

      <p>With a little program or scripts and (La)TeX it wouldn't
      be as diffcult to automatically generated such worksheets: A
      random number generator creates numbers between 1 and 12
      which are summarised pairwise to multiplication exercises and
      they are braced up to a block with LaTex and the
      multiplication sign (middle point) which can be printed. The
      teacher only have to invoke the program in the console and
      the printer would print a complete exercise sheet
      immediatley.</p>

      <p>Further features which could be added are for instance:
      Printing of a given number of sheets, inserting of a funny
      picture, the generation of exercises out of a specific number
      range, additional printout of the solution sheet or other
      operations than multiplication. All this could be added as an
      option invoking the command.</p>

      <p>Well that's it with the first edition of
      TUX&amp;GNU@school and I hope the lecture of the column was
      interesting. By the way the current and all older editions
      are available under [10]. So long and write a lot of
      criticism ...</p>
