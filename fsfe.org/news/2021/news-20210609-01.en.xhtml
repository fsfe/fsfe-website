<h1>REUSE Booster helps Free Software projects with licensing and copyright</h1>

<p>
  REUSE is a set of best practices to make Free Software licensing much
  easier. It helps developers with simple guidelines to declare
  their copyright and conditions for code re-use and provides help documents
  and low-threshold tools to get the job done. With REUSE Booster, we
  start to give direct support for Free Software projects.
</p>

<p>
  Since its beginning, the aim of <a
  href="https://reuse.software">REUSE</a>, an initiative led by the
  Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), has been to make licensing
  and copyright drastically easier for developers, especially those
  without legal experience and assistance. It is fair to say that this
  goal has already been achieved.
</p>

<p>
  REUSE offers standardised ways to mark all files in a project with
  their respective license and copyright. For developers, creating Free
  Software and communicating their conditions for code re-use are easier
  than ever before. REUSE offers a tutorial and FAQ, as well as the REUSE
  helper tool and the API to automate once manual processes. We are
  continuously working on improving all of these. But we won't stop
  here.
</p>


<h2>Introducing REUSE Booster</h2>

<p>
  With REUSE Booster, we go one step further. We invite Free Software
  projects to <a href="https://reuse.software/booster">register for
  getting help</a> by the FSFE's legal experts. As the name suggests,
  this will boost the process of adopting the best practices as well as
  general understanding of licensing and copyright.

<p>
  Accepted projects will be onboarded in a kick-off workshop in which
  the process and typical questions are clarified. Afterwards, each
  project will receive an individual evaluation that reveals
  potential challenges on their path to full REUSE compliance. If
  unforeseen problems arise, there will be direct contact persons that
  can provide guidance. Last but not least we will share practical
  suggestions on how to maintain a stable licensing status.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE already provides similar support for all projects in the <a
  href="/activities/ngi/">Next Generation Internet Zero (NGI0)
  project</a>. As consortium partners, we help developers to resolve
  licensing and copyright uncertainties and avoid legal pitfalls.
  Furthermore, many of them adopt the REUSE best practices to
  streamline their compliance. We now build on this practical
  experience and enable other projects to benefit from it. This is made
  possible by <a href="https://reuse.software/supporters/">REUSE
  sponsors</a> like Siemens and individual support by FSFE
  volunteers and <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/support">supporters</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If your Free Software project wants to get support to become REUSE
  compliant, <a href="https://reuse.software/booster">register</a>
  before 8 July 2021. Please also spread the word and inform other
  developers about this opportunity.
