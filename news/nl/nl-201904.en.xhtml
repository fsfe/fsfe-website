<p>Our campaign <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money? Public Code!</a> has really taken off, as German media <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M_AYj0gc_A">WDR</a> and <a href="https://t3n.de/news/sascha-lobo-breites-buendnis-code-1148918/">t3n</a> picked it up earlier this month. The FSFE's initiative received prominent support in the media from various Bundestag members, as well as digital politics activists and publicists embracing the free licenses for software receiving money from public sector.</p>
<p>Additionally, t3n, who also supports the campaign, published <a href="https://t3n.de/news/barcelona-touristen-hochburg-1139070/">an interview</a> with the FSFE's Public Policy Manager, Alexander Sander on the way public sector, like the city of Barcelona, deploys Free Software in its administration and city solutions: "The city manages to "react to the digital transformation with appropriate digital solutions". "The government's agenda today is 70 percent determined by the proposals made through Decidim." says the Public Policy Manager.  He believes that administrations could save money in the long term by using free-open source software: different communities might share programs and knowledge, new software would not have to be bought at high cost or completely redeveloped." Alexander Sander also mentioned Barcelona was the first major European city to support this action.</p>

<h2 id="copyright-directive-was-adopted">Copyright Directive was adopted</h2>
<p>The European Parliament adopted the controversial Copyright Directive by 348 votes in favour, 274 votes against and 36 abstentions. Heated discussions about the introduction of upload filters ended up in protests of hundreds of thousands of people in the streets all across Europe. You can read our <a href="/news/2019/news-20190326-01.html">press release</a> on the topic.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">Next Generation Internet Initiative</a>: The third call of NGI Zero Discovery and NGI Zero PET opened up on April 1st 2019, with a deadline for submissions of June 1st 2019 12:00 CET. </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://nlnet.nl/discovery/">NGI Zero Discovery</a></strong> is seeking for project proposals between 5.000 and 50.000 euros - with the potential to scale them up if there is proven potential. Search should not be a gatekeeper, a black box or a privacy nightmare. If the internet is the equivalent of a global brain, we need creativity and diversity in the pathways across that brain to unlock its true potential. Search and discovery are basic human needs for humans of all ages, and we would like to put powerful new technology in the hands of future generations as building blocks for a fair and democratic society and an open economy that benefits all.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://nlnet.nl/PET/">NGI Zero PET</a></strong> is seeking project proposals between 5.000 and 50.000 euros - with the potential to scale them up if there is proven potential. Reliability, confidentiality, integrity and security should be the 'new normal' of the internet, something ordinary users should not have to worry about. Trust is one of the key drivers for the Next Generation Internet, and an adequate level of privacy is a non-negotiable requirement for that. The desire is to assist independent researchers and developers to create powerful new technology, and to help them put it in the hands of future generations as building blocks for a fair and democratic society and an open economy that benefits all. </p>
<p>If your proposal ends up amongst the winners list, you will receive licensing advices and consultation from the FSFE team.</p>
