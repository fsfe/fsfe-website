    <title>Fellowship Interview with Sm치ri McCarthy</title>
    <body>
		Sm치ri McCarthy is a thoughtful anarchist and practical chaos technician - with a deep interest in Free Software and democracy. Currently serving as project manager for the Icelandic Innovation Center, Sm치ri works on digital fabrication and peer-to-peer education, while spending his spare time breaking the fundamental assumptions of how we organise society. I sat down for an interesting interview with Sm치ri, in which he explained his projects and how they can contribute towards a more sustainable world.
