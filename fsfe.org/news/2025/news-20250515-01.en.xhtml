<h1>Legal Corner: The threshold of originality for copyrightable source code</h1>

<p>As a general rule, software source code is protected
by copyright by default.  Copyright holders create Free Software by
applying a Free Software license to their code. Creative works,
such as source code, nevertheless must
be sufficiently original in nature before they can be protected by
copyright. /Exactly what is this “threshold of originality”, and are
there types of code that are not automatically 
protected by copyright?</p>

<h3>A Brief Introduction to Copyright in the European Union</h3>

<p>Copyright is a legal construct that grants a person exclusive rights
over a creative work. This can refer to almost any output/work produced
by a creator: written text, a piece of music, a film, etc. Source code
is included in this bundle of creative works that are protected by
copyright. In the European Union, this was confirmed by the European
Court of Justice in the case <a
href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=122362&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=6609060"><em>SAS
Institute Inc. v World Programming Ltd</em></a>:</p>
<p>“<em>… the source code and the object code of a computer program are
forms of expression thereof which ….. are entitled to be protected by
copyright as computer programs, by virtue of </em><a
href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/1991/250/oj/eng">Article 1(2) of
Directive 91/250</a>”</p>

<p>The most important exclusive right granted by copyright is in the
name itself: the right to produce copies. Only the copyright holder is
allowed to reproduce a work and to give new copies of that work to third
parties. Additionally, only the copyright holder has the exclusive right
to modify the work and to make it publicly available (for example, to
offer it up online for download).</p>

<p>Do note that there is a distinction between a “copyright holder” and
an “author”. The term “author” refers to the person who created the
particular piece of copyrighted work. Meanwhile, the “copyright holder”
is the person who has the exclusive rights over that work. Often, both
the author and the copyright holder are the same person, as copyright
automatically vests in the author from the instant that the work is
created. </p>

<p>In most legal systems, copyright can be passed on to someone else,
which is why the author and the copyright holder of a particular piece
of work can, in some circumstances, be two different entities.</p>

<h3>The Threshold of Originality</h3>

<p>While copyright automatically vests in the author at the moment of
the creation of a particular piece of work, this can only happen when
that piece of work clears what is referred to as the “threshold of
originality”. In other words, this means that <strong>the piece of work
has to be sufficiently original to justify it being protected by
copyright.</strong></p>

<p>In the legal context, being “sufficiently original” here first
indicates that the work must be independently created; in other words,
the work cannot be copied or comprised of another pre-existing work. To
this end, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has
clarified the status of the threshold of originality required for work
to be copyrightable under EU law. In <a
href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:62008CJ0005"><em>Infopaq
International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening</em></a>, the CJEU
affirmed that “<em>copyright … is liable to apply only in relation to a
subject-matter which is original in the sense that it is its
<strong>author’s own intellectual creation</strong>.</em>” </p>

<p>The EU <a
href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2009/24/oj/eng">Computer
Programs Directive</a> codifies these concepts specifically for source
code. Under Article 1(3), this Directive states that:</p>
<p>“a<em> computer program shall be protected if it is original in the
sense that it is the author’s own intellectual creation. No other
criteria shall be applied to determine its eligibility for
protection.”</em></p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is also important to note that an “original” work
for the purposes of copyright does not mean that the work has to be
“unique”, or “novel”. Originality for the purposes of copyright
therefore relates entirely to the origin or authorship of the work in
question; it only needs to be original in relation to the author.
Accordingly, a new work can be similar to others, but can still clear
the threshold of originality to attract copyright protection. </p>
<p>It is entirely possible that two authors, without ever having met
each other or discussed their work with each other, may create identical
pieces of work. In such a situation, both these works would still each
meet the threshold of originality, and therefore are subject to
copyright protection, even if to an outside observer, they are not
unique.</p>

<p>This emphasis on originality and not novelty was also <a
href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62018CA0833&amp;qid=1745855472388">further
clarified by the CJEU</a>, which stated that<em> </em>originality in EU
copyright law is dependant on the “<em>free and creative choices</em>”
of the author, signalling that the <strong>process</strong> by which the
work was accomplished plays a role in determining whether the work is
original enough to be protected by copyright, and not just the end
result.</p>

<h3>Clearing the Threshold</h3>

<p>Because the uniqueness or novelty of the work is not a factor, the
threshold of originality can be said to be a very low bar to clear. This
can be seen in the UK case of <a
href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2023/1354.html">THJ v
Sheridan</a> (while the UK is no longer part of the EU, UK copyright law
was nevertheless interpreted in accordance with the relevant EU law in
this case). This case concerned a software developer (“Mitchell”) who
had developed a software program to assist with trading options. The
defendant (“Sheridan”) would use Mitchell’s program to display data and
information to his clients.</p>

<p>The copyright dispute in this case partially concerned the copyright
in the images and charts generated by Mitchell with the help of his
software. Mitchell claimed that these images and charts were eligible
for copyright protection, while Sheridan claimed that, as what amounted
to charts presenting data and information, the images were not
sufficiently original to clear the threshold.</p>

<figure>

 alt="Chart created with Mitchell’s software showing a table with data on the right side and some graphics on the left."/>
<figcaption>Example image produced using Mitchell’s software</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The UK Court of Appeal, on observing such images, noted that:</p>
<ul>
<li>thought and care had to be put into how to lay out the information
and other component parts of each chart;</li>
<li>choices had to be made as to the fonts, colours, and other stylistic
elements constituting each chart; and</li>
<li>while each chart itself was not visually interesting, that in itself
did not mean an absence of creativity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these factors, we see that even a non-unique, relatively
uncreative work can still clear the threshold of originality for
copyright protection, as long as it is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the author’s own intellectual creation; and </li>
<li>made with free and creative choices.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the context of software, that would mean that most
developers’ original work would clear the threshold of originality and
warrant copyright protection, that is if they wrote lines of source
code by themselves without reference to other sources. </p>

<p>Being granted copyright protection is an important legal foundation
for creating Free Software. This is because copyright protection gives
developers the exclusive rights over their work. When developers then
exercise choices in what kind of freedoms users of their work are able
to enjoy (by licensing their work under a Free Software license, for
example), copyright law functions to <em>legitimize</em> this choice to
grant these rights to users. In other words, copyright gives developers
a legal framework under which to license their original work under a
Free Software license.</p>

<h3>Works That Do Not Clear The Threshold</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, there are always cases where some works may not clear
this threshold of originality. Short phrases, data, simple symbols, or
functional aspects of a particular piece of work are rarely considered
copyrightable. For example, short phrases such as “World’s Greatest
Dad”, or “better late than never” are not considered copyrightable.
Similarly, lists of data or works compiled from public domain materials
are also not considered to be copyrightable. The common theme in these
uncopyrightable works is that they are too generic or simple to be
considered an intellectual creation of the author.</p>
<p>Looking at this from a software perspective, a classic demonstration
of non-copyrightable work would be the following program:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/original/97/b3/6c0b8063e16d5c79c20292ab9060.jpg"
  alt="The string 'print Hello, World!' in different colors in a dark background"/>
</figure>

<p>Here, both the function expressed and the phrase “Hello, world!” are
simply too generic to be considered original works. </p>
<p>Developers will find that there are many such files or contributions
in their own project repositories, such as files automatically generated
by code, or config files that contain no creative expression. Similarly,
very minor contributions like fixing a syntax error or correcting a
spelling mistake can also be said to be non-copyrightable.</p>


<h3>The Threshold of Originality and AI</h3>

<p>With the rapid advancement of machine learning based generative
systems (“AI”), questions have been raised about whether code generated
by AI can be protected by copyright. These questions have not been
definitively answered, as there currently lacks a uniform legal approach
to classifying AI generated works. </p>

<p>This uncertainty has arisen because there is an unresolved debate
about whether or not an AI generative system can be considered an
author, thereby allowing AI generated works to be considered an
intellectual creation made with free and creative choices of the author.
While some consider that only human created works should be able to
clear the threshold of originality, there are nevertheless other voices
asking for copyright or similar legal protections over their investments
in AI and AI generated products. Until such debates are definitively resolved in
the law, copyright uncertainty will persist over AI generated works.</p>


<h3>How To Deal With Uncopyrightable Files In Your Repository</h3>

<p>The FSFE recommends the <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE
specification</a> for developers to properly display their licensing and
copyright information in their repositories. Generally, this would
entail <a href="https://reuse.software/faq/#why-care">including a
comment header in every file</a> indicating such information. As the
REUSE specification does not allow excluding files, some information
still has to be recorded for the uncopyrightable files in your repo.
</p>

<p>To <a href="https://reuse.software/faq/#uncopyrightable">deal with
these files</a>, you have two options:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Simply use your regular copyright and license for this file. There
is nothing that stops you from claiming copyright over your own works,
even if a court might hypothetically find such files
uncopyrightable.</li>
<li>Waive your copyright using the <a
href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0-1.0
license</a> or another similar public domain dedication.</li>
</ol>

<p>You may choose to use a copyright tag such as
<em>SPDX-FileCopyrightText: NONE</em> to assert that there is no
copyright holder.</p>

<p>Additionally, you may run into a situation where you are
incorporating code that you think is not copyrightable into your
software project. This could be because the code files are in your
opinion simply not original enough to warrant copyright protection, or
because they have been tagged in their original repos as having no
copyright. In such situations, it helps for your project to implement and
follow a strict compliance policy for code ingestion that includes
processes to confirm the non-copyrightability of such code, including
policies for scanning, tagging, and processing such code.</p>
<p>To that end, tools such as <a
href="https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">ScanCode</a>,
<a href="https://www.fossology.org/">Fossology</a>, and <a 
href="https://fossa.com/">FOSSA</a> exist to scan source code for
identifying, among other things, copyright ownership of the code. The
Linux Foundation has also made <a 
href="https://project.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/Reports/OpenSourceComplianceHandbook_2018_2ndEdition_DigitalEdition.pdf?hsLang=en">recommendations
for developing such a compliance policy</a>.</p>

<h3>Why REUSE Recommends License Tags Even For Uncopyrightable Files</h3>

<p>The reason that these files must be licensed is because opinions can
differ about the threshold of originality. You may consider a file so
insignificant that it does not merit licensing information, but
downstream users may disagree and believe that the file in question
falls under copyright, effectively disallowing them from using it if
there is no license.</p>

<p>Such disagreements over <span id="anchor-5"></span>copyrightability
have even been litigated in European courts. While court cases have yet
to provide an example directly relating to software and source code, they
have produced examples where different European courts have had different
opinions over whether the same piece of original work has cleared the
threshold of originality. </p>
<p>A legal dispute between two Italian cosmetic brands demonstrates this
difference clearly. The cosmetics brand KIKO S.p.A. (“Kiko”) claimed
that a competitor WYCON Cosmetics (“Wycon”) had copied the design of its
cosmetic stores, which included what Kiko claimed was a unique store
layout. As a result, Kiko brought copyright infringement lawsuits
against Wycon in a number of EU member states in which they both
operated, including Italy, Belgium, and Portugal. </p>
<p>In Italy, the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation confirmed that
Kiko’s store design reflected an expression of originality that
warranted copyright protection, and that the similarities of Wycon’s
shops amounted to copyright infringement. This was however not the
opinion of the Belgian and Portuguese courts, which took the opposing view
to the Italian courts. They were of the opinion that Kiko’s store layout
and their arrangement of store components were standard features of
cosmetics stores, and the store layout was essentially commonplace and
generic, and did not require intellectual creativity to create. Kiko’s
store design therefore could not pass the threshold of originality in
their opinion.</p>
<p>In this example, we can therefore see a situation where a piece
of work is able to be protected by copyright in one EU country, while
failing to do so in another. This difference in how domestic law in
different states may view the threshold of originality, even within the
EU, is a good reason for developers to think about how to display
copyright and licensing information in insignificant and uncopyrightable
files.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>In summary, the threshold of originality is a barrier to clear in
order for a piece of work to be protected by copyright. Works that are
of an author’s own intellectual creation and made with their free and
creative choices will in the vast majority of cases clear that bar. That
being said, there will be certain types of minor works in software, such
as insignificant contributions, insignificant files such as config
files, or generic lines of code, that taken by themselves will not
warrant copyright protection.</p>
<p>As a legal concept, the threshold of originality is useful for Free
Software developers to understand, so that they are able to discern
which parts of their work can and cannot be protected by copyright. This in
turn allows them to understand how to apply various standards and
specifications, such as the FSFE’s REUSE specification, in a manner that
helps to build a more informative and healthier Free Software legal
ecosystem. </p>
<p>That being said, AI advancement has disrupted conventional
understandings of originality and authorship. The discussion around
whether or not AI generated works pass the threshold of originality is a
complex one, which we will explore in a separate and future article.</p>
