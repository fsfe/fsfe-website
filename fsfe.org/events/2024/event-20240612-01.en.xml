      <p>For the June meeting of the Berlin local group of the FSFE we've invited our friend Kai from Zerocat to present his newest project the "Zerocat Mini Machine". The presentation will be in English except German is explicitly required by the audience.</p>
     <p>When: 12.06.2024, 7 p.m.<br/>
Where: xHain, Gr√ºnberger Str. 16, 10243 Berlin</p>
     <p>Zerocat Mini Machine: Put the fun back into hardware development!</p>
     <p>In respect to electronic hardware development, fun is gone as soon as the tools and the development process take your freedoms away, and bind you to proprietary concepts and business models. Zerocat Mini Machine will be different! While being an interesting hardware project by itself, targeting 100% integrity of text processing towards encrypted Morse code, it offers a rock-solid free license concept right from the start.</p>
     <p>All software tools of the development chain, e.g. 3D-CAD, Electronic Design Automation (EDA), PCB layout editing, and so on are fully qualified free software, provided in reproducible environments by means of the GNU Guix System.<br/>
