    <p>Although there are already more smartphones than humans on this planet, we keep producing additional 1.5 billion new smartphones every year. About 75% of them are Android phones, most of which are replaced again and again after only short usage times. This, although <strong>the environmental costs involved in the production of a smartphone are exceptionally high in comparison to its usage time.</strong> "Upcyling Android" is an initiative to change our short-term and linear consumption of smartphones and <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/upcycling.html">start upcycling our devices</a>. Learn on this page about the problems surrounding software obsolescence and how to overcome them with the use of Free Software:</p>

    <p>Smartphones are very valuable devices, not only for our personal communication and organisation. <strong>Every smartphone is rich in terms of the natural resources and the energy invested to produce them.</strong> Rare earths and other limited resources are required to produce many of the elementary technical components that any smartphone consists of. Many of such resources are not only extremely rare, their extraction also causes additional environmental damage through mining, for example. And worse: depending on their geolocation, mining of rare earths very often happens under inhumane conditions including child labor and other forms of human exploitation. Sometimes armed conflicts surround the most profitable mines and end up in massive social problem and violence, if not even territorial battles. </p>

    <p>After extraction, rare earth resources are send to manufacturies around the globe, mainly to South- and East-Asia, where in an energy-intensive process these resources are used to produce all the chips and connectors no smartphone can be used without. Several reportings from human rights associations let assume that assembling these modules into the phones in many cases again happens under conditions that are inacceptable in our European understanding of labor. Environmental problems arise from the high energy investments that are often product of fossil fuel burning as well as the disposal of waste that often happens with less attention towards their environmental impact as we know it from industries governed under European regulations.</p>

    <p>Once produced, these devices are sent around the world to end up in stores and inboxes of customers and consumers. <strong>The global transportation of necessary goods before and after assembling these phones again have a huge environmental impact.</strong> Finally, after an often short usage lifetime, <strong>the disposal of smartphone devices is equally troubling.</strong> The amount of e-waste in particular increases every year with over 50 million tons of electronic waste globally in 2019. Most of the scrap - including large parts of the recycling - ends up in the countries of the global south. Which introdices yet another global transportation stream and after arrival, the material is thinned through under perilous conditions to be searched for the last usable raw materials.</p>

    <p>Changing our linear consumption and extending the short usage times of  smartphones are important factors towards a more sustainable digital society. <strong>Every time we keep using our current smartphone instead of buying a new one we help avoiding the production of new phones and disposal of ewaste.</strong> Assuming if only one third of smartphone users would use their devices one year longer as now, this would reduce the production of new smartphones already by hundreds of millions of smartphones yearly and reduce the involved energy consumption significantly.

  <h2 class="painted" id="problem-short-life-time-through-software-obsolescence">Problem: Short life time through software obsolescence</h2>

    <p>To keep using our smartphones as long as we want often is not just a question of will or habit. Many manufacturers prefer that we regularly buy new phones instead of keep using our current ones. Non-repairability of devices, missing spare parts and other hardware-related obstacles are used to prevent users from keep using their devices if even just a minor part of the whole device is broken. Software however, plays an equally important part regarding the life-time of smart devices.</p>

    
  <h3>Software obsolescence</h3>

    <p>So called <strong>"software obsolescence" occurs when the manufacturer of a software ends the support for a current software so that no further support is provided and the subsequent version at the same time can no longer be executed on the previous hardware.</strong> In this case, the manufacturer runs consumers into the dilemma of either buying new hardware or to live with outdated software and potential security problems.</p>

    <p><strong>Software obsolescence is a major concern throughout the Android world:</strong> Google, the company behind Android, develops the operating system Android and provides the software for no cost to hardware manufacturers. Until recently, Google did not produce any phones themselves and focused on the operating system only. This because the business model of Google is to collect as many data as possible from any user for targeting ads and not to produce and sell hardware. Phone manufacturers whose business is to produce and sell hardware in turn profit from a well-known and widely established operating system for no costs and so they ship their product with the Android operating system.</p>

    <p>To be able to run Android on their phones, manufacturers have to package the software for their exact hardware specifications and firmware. They do however not further develop Android, nor do they profit from continuous phone usage by collecting individual data and selling it to the ad industry. That is what Google does. Which leads to the dilemma that manufacturers have no incentive in updating their once sold phones because it is not their operating system and all the data goes to Google. Instead, manufacturers only profit once in the sales of their phones. And so their incentive is to get customers to buy their new flagship phone every once in a while and to trash the old ones although they are still pretty good functioning.</p>

      <figcaption>The graphic shows the a cycle of software support as to be expected: when customers buy a smartphone with Android version x pre-installed, it should be common practice that whenever the next version (x + 1) of said operating system comes out, manufacturers offer an update to the previous version on their phones. This practice helps to keep users safe and to keep using their devices over a long period. </figcaption>
    </figure>

   <figure>
      <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/11615e46f7f68c976f490e01f1abdd64.png" />
      <figcaption>The graphic shows an unfortunately common practice in that the initial manufacturer does not deliver any next version of the operating system as an update on a phone once sold. Instead, the manufacturer often stops further support and users are left with the already mentioned problem of outdated software and potential security problems.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    

    <p>On a general note, software obsolescence can also occur vice versa: sometimes software manufacturers do not put efforts in backward compatibility of their software and a new version of the operating system is not able to be run on older devices. If this is combined with an enforced version upgrade by the software, that can lead to the devaluation of hardware that is actually still functioning by the new software. Such a practice is more likely to happen when manufacturers offer software and hardware in a bundle and try to enforce new sales among customers by devaluating old hardware. In the Android world this is however uncommon because of the aforementioned division between software and hardware manufacturers.</p>

  <h2 class="painted" id="free-software-as-a-sustainable-solution-out-of-the-dilemma">Free Software as a sustainable solution out of the dilemma</h2>

    <p>Enforced end of support of a software and corresponding devaluation of hardware can only occur in proprietary business models, where there is just one single entitity able to deliver updates or not. <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> in contrast solves the dilemma of software obsolescence through enabling all users and businesses to legally use, study, share and improve the software through its publication under a <a href="/freesoftware/legal/faq.html">Free Software license</a>. Apart from many other benefits, this leads into the situation that <strong>there cannot be a forced end of support or lifetime of any such software that is published under a Free Software license</strong>. This is in fact the most sustainable way of preserving digital resources as <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html#examining-the-sustainability-of-free-software">outlined in our study on software sustainability</a>.</p>

    <p>That means that any of your device that runs Free Software cannot be devaluated by an enforced upgrade to a non-compatible software nor by an enforced end of support. But although no enforced end of support is possible, it is still possible that the software is no longer continued. Free Software does not necessarily guarantee you any never-ending continuation. As in other areas the development of especially unknown software projects or those who do not receive enough support can be stopped at some point in time simply due to decreased interest. The critical difference however is that this is not something any single entity can decide or even plan for their marketing purposes and to speed up the sale of new hardware. If the development of Free Software is stopped by its initial authors, any other entity can pick up the software code and continue its development. <strong>In practice, Free Software publications usually lead to very vital markets with dozens of alternatives and solutions, offering extended usage lifetimes of hardware in several fields.</strong></p>


    <p>Now what about the Android world? How can you get Free Software on your phone? In fact, very large parts of the Android operating system - excluding third party apps, the G-Suite and some core libraries - are already Free Software. That is why there are dozens of alternative Android versions not from Google on the market, so called "Custom ROMs". <strong>If you like to benefit from Free Software sustainability on your Android phone you can replace the operating system with such a Free Software operating system.</strong> Unlike the operating systems offered by the initial manufacturers, these Custom ROMs often offer continued support, version upgrades and backward compatibility towards older devices.</p>

     <figure>
      <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/3988c08e462264bc9ffa89f29284acb3.png" />
      <figcaption>The graphic shows the dilemma and the solution to software obsolescence in one: sketched on the bottom is the above outlined dilemma of software obsolescence and the need to buy new phones instead or updating them by an enforced end of support from the initial manufacturer. On top we can see how alternative Custom ROMs often are able to offer subsequent versions of Android for a continued support of the same device already in use. </figcaption>
    </figure>

    

    <p><strong>Custom ROMs are modifications and Free Software operating systems of the original Android operating system, which enable users to install "new operating systems" on "old hardware".</strong> This means, that in many cases at least the current operating version can be supplied with security updates, and sometimes porting to higher operating system versions may also be possible. The users are no longer at the mercy of the dilemma of software obsolescence described above and the lifetime of the respective hardware can thus be significantly increased.</p>

    <p><strong>By extending the usage time of hardware and countering software obsolescence, Free Software can directly help save natural resources and achieve sustainable digitization.</strong> </p>

    <p><strong>Join our initiative and upcycle your smartphone.</strong> Together we can make a difference and help to reduce our natural resource consumption and CO2 footprint. Installing a Free Software system on your phone helps to keep your hardware up to date and to decide by yourself how long you like to use your device. In addition it comes with a lot of other benefits, it gives you <a href="/activities/android/android.html">full control over your device</a> and software, you can finally de-install apps you could not before and you profit from extended privacy protection - just to mention a few.</p>

    <p>Because many manufacturers prefer you buying a new phone instead of keep using your current device under your own control, installing alternative Free Software operating systems on Android phones is not always easy. Although after buying your device it is legally your property, said manufacturers often try to make you a hard time and restrict the access to your own hardware. Technical measures (e.g. blocking the bootloader) and legal measures (e.g. general terms and conditions and EULAs) are used to prevent you from installing alternative operating systems. But <strong>we are here to help you with!</strong></p>
