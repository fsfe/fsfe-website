        <title>SFSCON '23 - TEDective in Bolzano, Italy</title>

    <body>
      <p>TEDective is a free software (open-source) solution that makes European public procurement data explorable for non-experts. Letâ€™s say you are a curious citizen who wants to find out how much taxpayer money your municipality spends each year on unfree software. To date, there is no free software-backed, community-developed application out there that helps you answer this question.</p>
      <p>In the talk, Linus Sehn will show you the current status of TEDective  and how you can help to make TEDective more useful every day.</p>
