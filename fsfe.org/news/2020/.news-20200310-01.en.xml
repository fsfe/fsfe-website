<h1>Expert Brochure to Modernise Public Digital Infrastructure with Public Code - Translated Versions Online</h1>

<p>What is Free Software? How does it contribute to digital sovereignty, security and transparency of state digital infrastructure? Which steps can public administrations take? These and more questions are answered in our  publication "Public Money Public Code – Modernising Public Infrastructure with Free Software". After the successful release of the English version of our brochure we translated it into three more languages: German, Czech and Brazilian Portuguese. </p>

<p>The recent debates about digital sovereignty show that the desire for self-determined government action in the field of digitisation is immense. Digital services offered and used by our public administrations are the critical infrastructure of 21st century. In order to establish trustworthy systems, public bodies must ensure they have full control over the software and the computer systems at the core of our state digital infrastructure. We need software that helps public administrations regain sovereignty over their critical digital infrastructure, allowing them to become and remain independent from a handful of companies. </p>

<p>The brochure summarises the FSFE's long-term expertise with additional knowledge from leading experts in various ICT areas. It helps readers understand Free Software and its benefits for a modern digital public infrastructure. Hot topics covered include the avoidance of vendor lock-in, improvement of IT security through openness, exploring different business models, handling of procurement issues, and learning from innovative approaches to smart cities.</p>
