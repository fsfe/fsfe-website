    <title>Unlock Education in the Netherlands</title>
    <description>
      We want to enable all citizens to have free access to education
      and all other public institutions, both online and offline. We
      wish to achieve this by pushing for a mandatory use of Open
      Standards and guaranteed platform-independent access to all
      materials required in the public educational system. This allows
      students and parents to use Free Software, enabling them to tap
      into their potential for personal growth and development, without
      being made dependent of a company. This activity was specifically
      aimed at the Dutch education sector.
