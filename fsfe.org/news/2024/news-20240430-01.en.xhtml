<h1>Meet Antoni and Tobias, YH4F participants</h1>

<p>
Find out more about the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom participants of the 2023 
edition. We are continuing this series talking with Antoni and Tobias: 
Antoni developed a dictionary to preserve endangered languages, and 
Tobias conceived a rich featured calendar.

Antoni and Tobias participated in YH4F in 2023, being both currently in 
their last year of high school. Antoni is Polish and he developed the <a 
href="https://ankiedos.github.io/Endangered-Languages-Dictionary/about.en.html">Endangered 
Languages Dictionary</a>, software with the purpose of keeping 
languages at risk of extinction alive, valuing the contribution of 
native language speakers. Tobias comes from the Netherlands, and he 
developed <a 
href="https://edugit.org/thedutchprogrammers/plan2go">Plan2Go</a>, a 
calendar webapp he got the idea for while talking with his friends.

<hr />

<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Hi Tobias and Antoni! Can you introduce yourselves before explaining your projects?</p>
<p>
<strong>Tobias</strong>: I’m Tobias from the Netherlands and I’m 17 
years old. I love programming and helping others by making software. 
Sometimes I play video games or make stuff for video games.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Antoni</strong>: My name is Antoni, I am a high school student 
from Poland. I’m mainly a linguistics and computer science nerd, but am 
also interested in sociology, psychology, cultural studies, literature, 
and philosophy. I would like to study computer science and classics.
</p>

<p><strong>FSFE</strong>:  What is the project you developed for YH4F 2023? How does it work?</p>
<p><strong>Antoni</strong>: The <a href="https://ankiedos.github.io/Endangered-Languages-Dictionary/about.en.html">Endangered Languages Dictionary (ELD) project</a> aims to be a dictionary for the world’s languages that are at risk of extinction. The project home page–still in construction–intends to only have a title in Esperanto and a bar redirecting to the selected language main page. There one can search for a phrase. The browser calculates Levenshtein’s distance between the phrase being searched and all the phrases in the given sub-dictionary (the upper limit of the search is the number to the left of the search bar that one can specify, the default is 2). All phrases meeting the specified criteria are displayed on the page as hyperlinks to their specific pages.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tobias</strong>: I developed <a 
href="https://edugit.org/thedutchprogrammers/plan2go">Plan2Go</a> with 
the idea to make a planning app that is fully customisable and with many 
features. The front end has been coded with HTML and CSS, and the 
calendar and customisations are made using JavaScript. You can get 
access to the calendar by using the website hosted on GitLab Pages, by 
cloning the code and building the source, or by using the desktop app.

<p>
<strong>Tobias</strong>: Once you are in, you see an overview of the 
current month and you can click to add new events. If you click on an 
existing event, you can view more details about it and you can delete 
it. If you click above an event, you can add another event. Using the 
“Back” and “Next” buttons you can go back and forward in months. When an 
event starts, you could get a notification [not fully working, see below 
in the interview]. Overall, its key features are: multiple events per 
day, theme switcher, exporting and importing iCals, secret Easter Eggs, 
PWA installable and a desktop app version available.

<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What motivated you to create this software?</p>
<p>
<strong>Antoni</strong>: I wanted to provide an online presence of the 
endangered languages to prevent their native speakers, especially the 
young ones, from abandoning their tongues. I believe “if you aren’t 
online, you don’t exist” to be an unjust rule. This dictionary was going 
to be the first step in achieving this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tobias</strong>: Mostly, the idea came while talking with my 
friends, who just started programming. We made a whole list of stuff 
that we could make, and we shared this list publicly. Eventually, I just 
let my friends choose what to do. They chose to go with a planner, and 
we made that.
</p>
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: Your projects are Free Software! When and how did you get in touch with the movement?</p>
<p>
<strong>Antoni</strong>:  One day, at school, I was chatting with a 
classmate and introduced <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux">Windows 
Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a> to him. He replied he preferred 
VirtualBox, as “it is open source”  After I explained to him that he was 
wrong [VirtualBox is licensed under GPL, but the extensions are 
proprietary], and the openness of the source code of WSL, he asked for 
evidence, and he got it. After examining the codebase, he wrote me: “It 
is quite similar to the situation when you would paint a beautiful white 
shirt in brown just to wallow it in the mud. (of course the shirt is 
Linux)”. This has influenced me to the degree that I got pushed even 
further in that direction than my classmate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tobias</strong>:  I always only made software for myself, I 
began to do it more seriously when I found out that other people might 
also want my software. So I published it online, without any license.
</p>
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: So it seems that at the time you did not know 
that by default, if you do not specify a license, it is copyrighted.
</p> 
<p><strong>Tobias</strong>: Yes, I discovered Free Software licenses thanks to YH4F!</p>
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: Both projects are very interesting and ambitious. 
Why did you decide to code them from scratch, rather than to contribute 
existing projects?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tobias</strong>: It’s always nice to have one [project] that you 
can completely modify the way you want. If you are going to contribute 
to other projects that are already kind of finished, there is only a 
little bit of stuff that you might be able to add. We had about six 
months, and I did not really think I could just spend all of it 
contributing to just an existing project. Most probably, I would have 
been done before the end of the coding period. Above all, it is very 
helpful to know what’s behind a project you build from scratch by your 
own.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Antoni</strong>: I didn’t find any Free Software similar to 
mine, though I didn’t actively do any in-depth research. If it comes to 
the value of ELD, it is low-bandwith friendly as it doesn’t depend 
heavily on stylesheets. Additionally, this also implies a decrease of 
resources. needed only to render a webpage!
</p>
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: How was the experience of developing your software during YH4F 2023?</p>
<p>
<strong>Antoni</strong>: What I enjoyed the most was the fact that this 
is not only a competition, but also an opportunity to learn something, 
just by participating! I think that is mainly because of the long 
timespan given and the short list of requirements.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tobias</strong>: I liked the whole thing! You can program stuff, 
you can join meetings with other participants and have a discussion. For 
example, you can explain your project and then get some feedback. That’s 
the deal: making software and getting feedback from others. And just 
having fun.
</p>
<p><strong>FSFE</strong>: What are the future plans for your project?</p>
<p>
<strong>Antoni</strong>: I would like to share the message to conserve 
endangered languages because it is quite sad that we are losing 
linguistic diversity. The world would be less interesting and less rich. 
About extending the project, I am going to pause its development, and 
get back to it once I have resources, such as time and money.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tobias</strong>: If I find the time and I get an idea to add 
something to the software or just fix a feature that does not work right 
now (like the time notifications) then I will work on it. Otherwise, I 
will just leave it as it is right now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>FSFE</strong>: Thank you Antoni and Tobias. We wish you a bright 
future and a lot of success with your plans!
