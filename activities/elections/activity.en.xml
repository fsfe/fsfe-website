      What better time is there to ask politicians about their stance
      on Free Software and Open Standards than in the time before an
      election? We believe that we can and should make these topics an
      issue in all elections, be it on a European, national, regional,
      or local level. Depending on the electoral system and culture,
      there are different strategies and tools we use: Ask Your
      Candidates a set of questions, the Digital-O-Mat online tool, the
      Freedomvote online platform, and the Let's Promise pledges.
