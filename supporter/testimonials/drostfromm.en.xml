	  I believe Free Software needs a voice at the national as well as the
	  EU level in politics: Software does not exist in an isolated bubble,
	  it's heavily dependent on the ecosystem that it lives in. In my
	  opinion Free Software as well as open standards are key to creating a
	  society that provides equal access.
