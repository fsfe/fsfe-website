    <body>
      <p>
        After the LinuxInfotag in Augsburg, Fellows from the region
        meet in the <a
        href="http://www.restaurant-alt-athen.de/">Restaurant
        Alt-Athen</a>, where the LinuxInfotag's social event also
        takes place.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Fellows are cordially invited. If you want to join, please
        meet the FSFE team at LinuxInfotag before 16:00 so we can
        inform the restaurant early enough.
