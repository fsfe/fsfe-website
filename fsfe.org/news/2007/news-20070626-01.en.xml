    <title>Six questions to national standardisation bodies</title>
    <body>
      <p>
      The following six questions relate to the application of the
      ECMA/MS-OOXML format to be accepted as an IEC/ISO
      standard. Unless a national standardisation body has conclusive
      answers to all of them, it should vote no in IEC/ISO and request
      that Microsoft incorporate its work on MS-OOXML into ISO/IEC
      26300:2006 (Open Document Format).
