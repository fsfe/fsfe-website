<h3 id="interoperable-europe-act-adopted-close-monitoring-vital"><a href="/news/2024/news-20240206-01.html">Interoperable Europe Act adopted, close monitoring vital</a></h3>
<p>The Interoperable Europe Act has been adopted, on 6 February, in plenary with 524 votes in favour, 18 against, and 97 abstentions. Although some of the potential of the regulation got undermined, the Act as a whole is an important opportunity for Free Software and its community to contribute to an interoperable Europe. The FSFE will closely monitor its implementation.</p>

<p>Find out more about the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom participants in the 2023 edition! We are starting this series of interviews talking with Jannes and Aaron: both worked on projects related to school education, and it is particularly interesting to see how these two projects approached different aspects with a similar spirit.</p>

<h3 id="edulife"><a href="/news/2024/news-20240122-01.html">The FSFE partners with the Edulife Foundation to introduce Italian students to Free Software</a></h3>
<p>In the framework of the ITS Academy LAST project, the Free Software Foundation Europe and the Edulife Foundation, the operational partner of ITS Academy LAST, have developed a two-year agreement to deliver educational content to students about Free Software legal aspects, policy, and public awareness.</p>

<h3 id="ngi-21.6-million-in-grants-for-free-software"><a href="/news/2024/news-20240117-01.html">NGI: € 21.6 million in grants for Free Software</a></h3>
<p>The Next Generation Internet (NGI) Zero consortium, of which the FSFE is a partner, has just unveiled the NGI0 Commons Fund. This new public fund will award 21.6 million euro to small and medium R&amp;D projects developing Free Software technologies that can improve the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="take-action-help-us-spread-the-word-about-router-freedom">Take action: Help us spread the word about Router Freedom!</h3>
<p>Since several countries have officially introduced the possibility for users to use their own routers, we want to encourage people to try out and enjoy this freedom. <a href="/donate?mtm_campaign=routerfreedom">We need your help</a> to design, publish, and print materials that can be used on booths and at other in-person events, so people can talk about and collectively learn about using their own routers.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Leaflet</strong>: If we raise <strong>3,000 euros</strong>, we can cover the costs for the design and printing of a new leaflet with a nice and intuitive design for the decision tree, as well as with basic information about Router Freedom. As are all our information materials, it will also be available under a free license on <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword">our website</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Sticker</strong>: As a thank you for your help, did you know that you can order our <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword#device-neutrality">Router Freedom sticker</a> for free to show off on your liberated router/modem?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quote">Quote of the month</h3>
<blockquote>
	<cite>I believe Free Software needs a voice at the national as well as the EU level in politics: Software does not exist in an isolated bubble, it’s heavily dependent on the ecosystem that it lives in. In my opinion Free Software as well as open standards are key to creating a society that provides equal access.</cite>
<p>Isabel Drost-Fromm (Software Engineer and Member of the Apache Software Foundation)</p>
