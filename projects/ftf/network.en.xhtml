<p>The Freedom Task Force coordinates a large network of lawyers called the European Legal Network.  If you want to find a legal expert in a country near you, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.  We can assist in finding legal experts in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Greece, Germany, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands and the UK.  We also maintain contacts in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the USA.</p> 

<p>If you are a legal expert interested in participating in the European Legal
  Network please <a href="contact.html">let us know</a>.  We are particularly interested in finding experts in the EU27 countries where we don't already have coverage.</p>

<p>Some exceptional network delegates are explicitly recommended by FSFE.  To be explicitly recommended the delegate must have contributed significantly to Free Software and be <a href="legal-network-policy.html">approved</a> by the governing council of FSFE.</p>
