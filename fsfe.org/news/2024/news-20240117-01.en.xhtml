<h1>NGI: € 21.6 million in grants for Free Software</h1>

<p>
The Next Generation Internet (NGI) Zero consortium, of which the FSFE is a 
partner, has just unveiled the NGI0 Commons Fund. This new public fund 
will award 21.6 million euro to small and medium R&amp;D projects 
developing Free Software technologies that can improve the Internet.

<p>
The <a href="https://nlnet.nl/NGI0/">Next Generation Internet Zero 
consortium</a> aims to build a more resilient, trustworthy, and open 
Internet that empowers end-users to control technology. Since 2018, FSFE 
has been a partner of this coalition, led by the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/NGI0/">NLNet Foundation</a>, providing support to 
several hundreds of Free Software projects with their legal and 
licensing issues. The FSFE has developed <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/NGI0/V2/FSFE%20-%207%20-%20FAQs%20and%20Background%20Information.pdf">workflows 
and best practices</a> for such projects. We have also been promoting 
the <a href="http://reuse.software/">REUSE specification</a> as a way to 
simplify copyright and licence compliance for software projects.
</p>

<p>
The NGI Commons Fund will award over 21 million euro in small and medium 
R&amp;D grants to Free Software projects starting in 2024, until 2027. 
This makes the fund the single largest investment made by the European 
Commission’s <a href="https://NGI.eu/">Next Generation Internet 
initiative</a> since it became operational in 2019.
</p>

<h3>Simplified granting process</h3>
<p>
The grants (between 5,000 and 50,000 euro) are available to individuals 
and organisations of any type. One requirement for receiving a grant is 
that the project outcomes must be made publicly available under a Free 
Software license. For projects with high scalable potential, a scale-up 
programme is also available.
</p>

<p>
The scope of the open calls is broad, meaning that those working on 
technology commons across the entire technological spectrum can apply: 
operating systems, front and backend apps, AI, open hardware, encryption 
and security technologies, and many more areas are included.
</p>

<p>
The first call of <a href="https://nlnet.nl/commonsfund/">the NGI Zero 
Commons Fund</a> opens on <strong>1 February 2024, with a deadline of 
1 April 2024 12:00 CET (noon)</strong>. It will be followed by new 
opportunities every two months until the budget is fully allocated.
</p>

<p>
Besides financial support, the projects can count on a range of support 
services to improve the quality, maturity, and deployability of their 
efforts. Practical services such as security, accessibility audits, and 
packaging help to improve the quality and promote adoption of the 
projects. Services like mentoring and diversity management aim to 
strengthen the communities behind them or, in the case of the FSFE, to 
help with legal and licensing questions.

<blockquote>
“We believe the NGI0 Commons Fund to be a crucial stepping stone for 
promoting the development of Free Software in Europe. Free Software is 
key for helping people to control technology in a democratic society.  
Fostering digital commons through these investments will render 
technologies more accessible and the internet less dependent on 
proprietary solutions”, Gabriel Ku Wei Bin, FSFE’s Legal Programme 
Manager.
</blockquote>
