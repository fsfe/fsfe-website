      <p>
At FSFE my time was always shared between learning and doing. When dealing with a task,
I was encouraged to research background information and to understand the political questions
underlying each issue. Curiosity is what an intern needs most.

      <p>
        Working at the Free Software Foundation Europe lets you get close to
an amazing variety of topics and tasks. This diversity brings a lot of
technical, organisational, social and political experience and skills,
which are great to have for any Free Software enthusiast.

        FSFE is a stimulating environment to work in. There are few
        organisations where you can learn from so many perspectives in this
        international and interdisciplinary context. If you read my <a
          href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/hugo">blog</a>, you can have a good overview
        of some things I've been working on.  <cite><a

<h2>Basic internship facts: </h2>
<p>
When an internship opening is announced (primarily in our
<a href="/news/newsletter">newsletter</a>), you will find more
details about each specific internship there. Sometimes we offer
longer internships, and other times we seek applicants with
a specific focus (for instance students for summer internships).
</p>

<ul>
        <li>Duration: 3 months, full-time.</li>
        <li>Location: Berlin, Germany. </li>
        <li>Compensation: Interns receive a basic compensation, the
amount of which is announced when an opening is announced.</li>
        <li>Requirement: The internship is open to EU citizens, and
anyone else holding a residence permit and a work permit for Germany. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who we're looking for:</h2>
<p> 
FSFE interns are a pretty diverse bunch. If you are interested in
working on the frontline of technology policy and activism, then
you've come to the right place. You're fired up about a free
information society, and you've already done something to tell others
why freedom matters? Then this internship is for you. Your academic
background and qualifications matter less than your experience, your
will to learn, and your ability to get things done. We expect:
</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
          Solid basic knowledge of, and considerable interest in, Free
          Software (required)
        </li>
        <li>
          Fluent English (written and spoken) is a requirement; 
          a working knowledge of other languages is an asset.
        </li>
        <li>
          Basic acquaintance with working on GNU/Linux systems (desirable)
        </li>
        <li>
         Ability to be creative, responsible, and to multitask. 
        </li>
        <li>
         Ability to integrate into a young, motivated and professional team
        </li>
        <li>
          No programming skills required. Programming is one of the
          few things you probably <i>won't</i> be doing during your
          internship, unless you're applying for a technical
          internship.
        </li>
	<li>We want more women to be involved in Free Software. That's
	why we will give preference to applications from suitably
	qualified female candidates.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>
       Having no hacking experience but a strong political background,
working for the FSFE was an amazing experience for me and the same
will be true for everybody interested in software and users freedom.
International collaboration, writing policy papers, contact
stakeholders and taking care of community activities are just examples
of interesting tasks to learn from and that are quite fun in FSFE`s
friendly team.
