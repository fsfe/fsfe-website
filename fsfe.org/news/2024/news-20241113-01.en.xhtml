<h1>EU consultation confirms demand: long-term funding for Free Software is needed </h1>

<p>
The FSFE called on the community to participate in a consultation on the 
European Union’s Digital Europe Programme and demanded   long-term 
sustainable funding for Free Software after recent budget cuts. Results 
show its success.

<a href="/news/2024/news-20240719-01.html">In response to the European 
Commission's €27 million budget cut for Free Software projects</a> this 
summer, the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) has been demanding 
sustainable, long-term funding for Software Freedom. Last September, <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240911-01.html">the FSFE participated in the 
European Commission’s public consultation</a> on the Digital Europe 
Programme’s interim evaluation. FSFE stressed that reliable long-term 
funding for Free Software is essential to drive Europe’s digitization 
efforts towards sovereignty and control over technology.
</p>  

<p>
The results of the interim evaluation <a 
href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13880-Digital-Europe-programme-interim-evaluation_en">were 
presented</a> today, and they show that <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240911-02.html">the FSFE’s call to action, based 
on our answers, was heard</a>. Nearly 800 answers were received,  —an 
unusually high number for such consultations. In the open-ended 
responses, participants highlighted Free Software as a vital component 
of Europe’s digital future. Additionally, many respondents highlighted 
Free Software’s role in enhancing cross-border collaboration and argued 
that stable, dedicated funding for Software Freedom would maximize the 
impact and value of Europe’s digital agenda. This feedback not only 
emphasizes the importance of Free Software and its sustainable funding 
for European digital policy, but also demonstrates the value of public 
input and the need to provide citizens with meaningful tools to share 
their opinions.
</p>

<p></p>
<blockquote>
“The strong response from the public underscores what the FSFE has been 
pointing out for years: Free Software is an  essential tool for a 
sovereign, transparent, collaborative, and innovative digital Europe. 
Therefore Software Freedom must be supported with long-term 
funding",<cite> says Alexander Sander, FSFE Senior Policy 
Consultant.</cite>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>

consultation. Let’s keep working  together for a sustainable funding 
model for Free Software in Europe! More details on this important issue 
will be covered in our next episode of the <a
