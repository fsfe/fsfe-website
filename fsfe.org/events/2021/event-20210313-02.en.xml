        <title>»Public Money? Public Code!« (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>On Sunday, 14 March, at 2:00 pm (CET) Bonnie Mehring will holde a talk at this years Chemnitzer Linux Days about the longstanding campaign "Public Money? Public Code!". She will explain how the campaign framework can be used to push for the adoption of Free Software friendly policies on a local level.</p>
<p>With "Public Money? Public Code" more than 200 organisations, and more than 29,000 individuals demand that publicly financed software should be made publicly available under Free Software licenses. Together we contacted politicians, decision makers,  and civil servants on all levels -- from the European Union and national governments, to city mayors and the heads of public libraries about this demand. This did not just lead to important discussions about software freedom with decision makers, but also already to specific policy changes. Already, we have administrations from Spain, Sweden and Germany supporting “Public Money? Public Code!”. It is no registration required.</p>
