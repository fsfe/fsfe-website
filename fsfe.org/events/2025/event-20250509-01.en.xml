      <p>It is crucial that hackers, organizations, and activists in the Free Software world can reach out to their representatives about the issues that matter most to them. However, it is often a challenge for individuals and smaller groups to make their interests heard, while larger organizations with vast resources have no trouble getting the attention of policymakers. Unfortunately, the interests of the Free Software community are often overlooked, while these bigger organizations have a louder voice in the political sphere.</p>
     <p>MP Scrape is a Free Software project developed by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), aimed at leveling the playing field by making it easier for individuals and smaller organizations within the Free Software community to contact their elected officials. By gathering up-to-date and reliable information about Members of Parliament (MPs) across Europe from various sources, MP Scrape helps activists, civil society, and Free Software enthusiasts access accurate and up-to-date contact details for MPs, empowering them to advocate for the causes they care about.</p>
     <p>This talk is presented by the creator of the project, Sofía Aritz, at 13:10 CEST. This talk is in Spanish. The event is free of charge and you may get your tickets at https://salmorejo.tech/2025.</p>
