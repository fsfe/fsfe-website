<h1>The FSFE calls for broader interoperability by Apple under the DMA</h1> 

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe, alongside civil society
organizations, developers and researchers, submitted its position to the
European Commission’s public consultation on measures requiring Apple to
ensure compliance with the Digital Markets Act’s interoperability
provisions. The FSFE stressed the urgent need for Apple to provide effective,
free-of-charge interoperability.</p>

<p>In parallel to <a href="/activities/apple-litigation/apple-litigation.en.html">the
litigation efforts against Apple</a>, the FSFE continues to collaborate
with the European Commission and other stakeholders in the enforcement
of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Alongside other civil society
organizations, researchers and developers, <a 
href="https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ARTICLE-19_Joint-submission_EC_PUBLIC-CONSULTATION_APPLE_ARTICLE-67.pdf">the 
FSFE submitted
its position</a> to the European Commission to improve
the European Commission’s <a 
href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/dma100204-consultation-proposed-measures-requesting-interoperability-apples-ios-and-ipados-operating_en">proposal</a>
to regulate Apple’s approach towards interoperability in its iOS and
iPadOS operating systems, as required by Article 6(7) of the DMA.</p>

<p>The FSFE is demanding a shift towards “interoperability by default”.
Apple’s reactive approach is at odds with the DMA, undermining developer
agency and consumer choice. The FSFE urges that Apple should
not deny software interoperability at its discretion, but the process for
assessing interoperability requests should be transparent and
non-discriminatory. We recommend that the Commission take a more active
role by scrutinizing Apple’s decisions and intermediating conflict
resolution among Apple and access-seeking developers. Besides, Apple
should not rely on API security by obscurity, but the Commission should
require public API documentation. We suggest that the Commission require Apple to also adopt
an effective bug-tracking system and prohibit the company from requiring 
non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) from
developers who wish to interoperate with iOS and iPadOS.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>The FSFE has ensured that the
voices of Free Software developers, particularly smaller projects, are
heard. We welcome the European Commission’s steps
toward demanding effective and transparent measures from
Apple, but a fundamental shift
towards "interoperability by design" would be the most impactful
improvement. DMA is not only about regulating competition among gatekeepers but also
levelling the playing field to SMEs and smaller software developers. Therefore, it is crucial to keep
Apple’s approach to interoperability under strict scrutiny from the Commission and civil
society." <cite> Lucas Lasota, FSFE Legal Programme Manager</cite>

<p>In addition, the FSFE is participating in a comprehensive study on how Apple’s
restrictive interoperability policies harm Free Software. This research
was first presented in November 2024 during a conference on the DMA
implementation in Brussels and will also be presented at an <a 
href="https://kgi.georgetown.edu/events/dma-and-beyond-conference/">upcoming
event</a> organized by the Knight-Georgetown Institute and Yale
University in Washington, D.C., in February 2025.</p>
