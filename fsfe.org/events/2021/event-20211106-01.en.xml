        <title>FSFE Legal Education Day (LED) (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>The FSFE is organizing the first Legal Education Day (LED). It will take place on Saturday 6th of November 2021 from 12:00 to 17:30 CET. This webinar is open for all to attend free of charge.</p>
      
       <p>It aims to spread basic legal education on the legal context of Free Software, so that licensing your project, understanding copyright, and meeting legal obligations in your software project will be less of a daunting task! We will explain basic legal concepts such as license, copyright law, and its practical application into your projects with our REUSE initiative. Trademarks, Patents, and Containers are more advanced parts of our <a href="https:/freesoftware/legal/led.html">agenda</a>. </p>
