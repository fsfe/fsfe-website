<h2 id="status">Current status</h2>

<p>
  The Software Patent Directive was rejected by the European
  Parliament on the 6th of July 2005, after seven years of campaigning
  by people in FSFE and other organisations - most notably, one of our
  associate organisations, <a href="http://www.ffii.org/">FFII</a>.
  This was a monumental victory and displays the legislative
  competence of the Free Software community.  However, the struggle is
  not over.  The future of software patents is not decided in Europe,
  and the problem is growing in other parts of the World.
</p>

<p>
  More specifically, the software patent problem may return via
  initiatives such as the Community Patent or the European Patent
  Litigation Agreement (EPLA).  More information and a description of
  how it may come back is in this August 2006 blog

    <h3>2006-March-31st: Response submitted to EC patent questionnaire</h3>

    <p>FSFE has submitted its response to the European Commission's
    questionnaire titled "On the patent system in Europe".</p>

    <h3>2005-July-6th: Software Patent Directive Dropped</h3>

    <p>After years of struggle, the European Parliament finally rejected the
       software patent directive with 648 of 680 votes.</p>

    <h3>2005-July-1st: Bullet Points on the Second Reading</h3>

    <p>
      One week before the second reading vote by the European
      Parliament, FSFE sent a simplified explanation of the core areas
      of confusion.  This was delivered in six languages which were
      produced on short notice by the FSFE Translation Team.

    <h3>2005-June-28th: Karlsruhe Memorandum</h3>

    <p>
      The Free Software Foundation Europe has published, on June 28th
      2005, the Karlsruhe Memorandum against software patents. This
      memorandum collected more than 200 signatures at this year's
      GNU/LinuxTag conference in Karlsruhe.  Citing scientific
      evidence, the text argues that software patents in Europe will
      hurt jobs and innovation. Among the supporters are leaders of
      some of Europe's biggest trade union groups.  All MEPs received
      a copy of this.

    <h2 id="about">About the problem</h2>

    <p>
      The Free Software Foundation Europe is actively working against
      the introduction of software patents in Europe.  Software
      patents create the following problems.
    </p>
    
    <ul>

      <li>Add legal risks, and therefore costs, to software development</li>

      <li>Specifically inhibit the development of useful software by
      blocking compatibility and interoperability</li>

      <li>Patents are incompatible with software because software is
      so complex - too many ideas are used for it to be practical to
      count them and check them against existing patents</li>

    </ul> 

    <p>
      To understand how patents work, it is important to realise that
      they have almost nothing in common with copyright.  While
      Copyright is granted on the the work of an author, such as a
      computer program, patents are granted on ideas that could be
      used inside a computer program.  So when thinking of Patents,
      think of "symphony combining wind and string instruments" and
      not "Beethoven's 2nd symphony."
