    <center><h1>Software Patents in Europe</h1></center>

<p style="background-color: red; color: white; font-weight:
  bold;">While the Software Patent Directive has officially been
dropped on 6 July 2005, software patents remain a pressing issue for
people around the world -- and are likely to re-enter the European
stage sometime soon. For this reason we will keep this page on-line as
reference and for reactivation when the need arises.</p>

    <p>
      One week before the second reading vote by the European

    <h3>2005-June-28th: Karlsruhe Memorandum</h3>

    <p>
      The Free Software Foundation Europe has published, on June 28th
      2005, the Karlsruhe Memorandum against software patents. This
      memorandum collected more than 200 signatures at this year's
      GNU/LinuxTag conference in Karlsruhe.  Citing scientific
      evidence, the text argues that software patents in Europe will
      hurt jobs and innovation. Among the supporters are leaders of
      some of Europe's biggest trade union groups.  All MEPs received
      a copy of this.

    <h2>Why software patents are bad</h2>

    <p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is actively working against the introduction of
      software patents in Europe. Claims to innovation and competition made by software
      patent advocates lack any scientific or empirical backing. In reality, software patents
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>establish <b>monopolies on abstract ideas</b>.</li>
      <li><b>prevent innovation</b> by allowing grants without implementation (Source Code) and thereby preventing such research.</li>
      <li><b>prevent competitive markets</b> by giving large players absolute control over the marketspace.</li>
      <li><b>prevent disclosure</b> of ideas, the original motivation for the introduction of patents.</li>
      <li><b>reduce European competitiveness</b>.</li>
      <li><b>prevent interoperability</b>, increasing your dependance on a single vendor.</li>
      <li>transversally spread their <b>negative effects in all areas of economy</b>.</li>
    </ul> 

    <p>Please note that Patents on software should not be confused with
      Copyright on software. While Copyright is granted on the implementation,
      the actual program, Patents are granted on ideas that could be
      implemented in software. So when thinking of Patents, think of "symphony
      for a certain set of instruments" and not "Beethoven's 2nd."</p>
