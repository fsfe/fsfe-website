We are in the middle of an intense battle about who will control the computers we'll use tomorrow. At the OpenMind conference in Helsinki, Finland, Karsten Gerloff will explain why the general-purpose computer is worth fighting for. The event is co-located with the <a href="http://okfestival.org">Open Knowledge Festival</a>. Karsten's talk starts at 11:30.
