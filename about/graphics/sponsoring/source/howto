To generate logos for a given year:

run
./genyear.sh year outputdir

Where year is the the year for which the buttons should be generated, preferably a 4 digit number but something lile "Mar 18" or 2018/03 would work as well (and probably break the template layout).

Where outputdir is the name of a directory where the files will be generated. If outputdir is not given, it defaults to the current dir. The directory must already exist, it will *not* be automatically created by the script.

Make sure that button_template.svg is available when you run the script.

(DEPRECATED: The script will also generate xhtml chunks for inclusion in the sponsoring.xhtml file. You can find the xhtml code in the output directory (file: xhtml) after running the script. To be provided with correct path names in the xhtml output it is recommended to run the script from the directory containing "sponsoring.xhtml".)

After running the script, open the file about/graphics/sponsoring/sponsoring-buttons.en.xml and add the new year. You don't need to edit sponsoring.en.xhtml or translated files, but it might need a full site rebuild or a fake update to have the website updated.

Note:
generate-all.sh and sponsoring_buttons.svg are DEPRECATED.
