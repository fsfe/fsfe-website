	  When I started to engage with software, there was only Windows and
	  purchasable software around me. I tried to understand the relations
	  between the elements presented to me, but I was only able to inspect
	  the surface. I started to understand so much more, when I got to know
	  an environment where free software was available and I could see the
	  source code. I want to make this possibility and this way as
	  accessible as possible to everyone, so every generation of software
	  developers can do better.
