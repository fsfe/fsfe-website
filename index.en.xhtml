      Welcome to the home page of the Free Software Foundation Europe. The FSFE
      was launched on 10 March 2001 and supports all European aspects
      of <a href="documents/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>; especially the
      <a href="documents/gnuproject.html">GNU Project</a>. We are actively
      supporting development of Free Software and furthering GNU-based
      Operating Systems such as GNU/Linux. Also, we provide an assistance
      centre for politicians, lawyers and journalists in order to secure the
      legal, political and social future of Free Software.
    </p>

    <p>
      FSFE's work is made possible by many individual contributions, in
      particular to the <a href="http://www.fsfe.org">Fellowship of FSFE</a>.
      One way to contribute is to
      <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/about/">join now</a>, and to encourage
      others to do likewise.
