             Staring 14h30, after
a <a
href="http://noepatents.eu.org/index.php/Demo_Against_Software_Patents">street
demonstration against software patents</a>, FSFE will be organising a
Freedom Party to celebrate digital freedom as part of its
<a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org">Fellowship campaign</a>.  The venue hasn't been set yet, 
but it will be close to Square de Meeus, where the street demonstration ends.  Square de Meeus
is a grassy square that sits on either side of Rue de Luxembourg,
half-way between the European Parliament and Trone metro station.
