<h1>GPLv3: Drafting version 3 of the GNU General Public License</h1>


<p>
  Welcome to FSFE's GPLv3 project page.  Our goals are to raise
  awareness of the proposed licence changes, to help people to
  participate in the public consultation, and to constantly document
  the current state of the discussion so that members of the community
  can enter the discussion knowing the current state.
</p>

<p>
  Much of FSFE's GPLv3 work is made possible by
  the <a href="http://fsfe.org">Fellowship of FSFE</a>.  To support
  the this work, consider joining the Fellowship and encouraging
  others to do so.  You can also support FSFE
  by <a href="/help/donate">making a donation</a>.

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline: What's happening</h2>

<p>
  The first public discussion draft of GPLv3 was published on January
  16th 2006 on the <a href="http://gplv3.fsf.org/">gplv3.fsf.org</a>
  web portal.  On the same day, a year-long public consultation
  process began.  This occurred during the first international GPLv3
  conference.
</p>

<p>
  On July 27th, the second draft was published, responding to six
  months of public comments.  You can see
  the <a href="diff-draft1-draft2.html">changes from draft 1 to draft
  2</a>, or the <a href="diff-gplv2-draft2.html">changes from GPL
  version 2 to draft 2 of GPLv3</a>.
</p>

<p>
  A third draft is expected in early December.
</p>

<p>
  The official version three of the GNU GPL is expected to be
  published in January 2007, or as late as March.
</p>



<h2 id="intro">The aims of GPLv3</h2>

<p>
  Version 2 of the GNU GPL - the current official (non-draft) version
  - was published in 1991.
  The purpose of the GPL is to ensure that everyone who receives a
  copy of GPL-licensed software is free to use that software, to
  modify it, and to redistribute it in modified or unmodified form.
</p>

<p>
  Today it is by far the most used licence
  for Free Software.
  The number of people who use software which is distributed under the
  terms of the GPL is somewhere in the region of 100s of millions.
</p>

<p>
  Version 3 will do the same job as version 2 but will be updated to
  account for changes in software's legal and technical environment,
  and to thwart new techniques devised in the past fifteen years to
  take the above freedoms away from software users.
</p>





<h2 id="participate">How to participate</h2>
