    <h1>What is Free Software</h1>
    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
        The principles of Free Software are simple but it is important to not
        get confused by the underlying complexity caused by its long history.
        Learn about the <a href="#freedoms">four freedoms</a> and their meaning,
        the fundamentals about <a href="#licences">Free Software licenses</a>,
        the most common <a href="#synonyms">synonyms</a>, and the <a
        href="#advantages">advantages</a> that Free Software provides.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking beyond the circle of software itself, you can read more about
        the interplay of Free Software with <a href="#more">other fields</a>
        like education, procurement and democracy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="freedoms">The Four Freedoms</h2>

    <p>
      Free Software refers to freedom, not price. It guarantees its users the
      essential four freedoms. The absence of at least one of these freedoms
      means an application is proprietary, so non‐Free Software.

       </ul>
     </div>

    <h2 id="licences">Licenses</h2>

    <p>
      The four freedoms are given by a software’s licence. Software licences
      define the conditions under which a programme can be used and reused. For
      it to be Free Software, the licence text must contain at least the four
      freedoms. The <a
      href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">Free Software
      Foundation</a> and the <a
      href="https://opensource.org/licenses/category">Open Source Initiative</a>
      maintain lists of reviewed and approved licences. An application can
      usually not be considered Free Software, if its licence does not appear in
      one of these lists.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a multitude of licences with different focal points, and a
      software product or parts of it can also be licenced under more than one
      licence. The actual selection is a strategic question but you are advised
      to pick one of the most widely used licences.
    </p>

    <h2 id="synonyms">Synonyms</h2>

    <p>
      Over the course of time, people came up with additional labels for Free
      Software. Often the motivation for these terms is to highlight different
      aspects and to avoid confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Free Software is the original term, created in 1986 when the <a
      href="/freesoftware/gnuproject.html">GNU project</a> defined the four
      freedoms mentioned above. In 1998, "Open Source" has been set up as a
      marketing campaign for Free Software but with the same freedoms in mind.
      Other widely known labels for Free Software are "Libre Software",
      initiated to avoid the ambiguity of the English word "free", and "FOSS" or
      "FLOSS" as abbreviations for "Free (Libre) and Open Source Software".
    </p>

    <p>
      The level of freedom a particular software offers is always determined by
      the licence, not the label. In other words, don’t get confused by
      different terms for the same features. If you are interested in the
      historical background and why we prefer the original term, you can <a

    </p>

    <h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

    <!-- adopted from PMPC brochure p.16+17 -->

    <p>
      Free Software is about freedom. In practice, this provides numerous
      advantages for users, organisations, businesses and administrations.

    <h2 id="more">Further insights</h2>

    <p>
      The numerous advantages of Free Software are a benefit in itself, but also contribute positively to other technical and non-technical fields. Since the FSFE's foundation in 2001, we have been exploring different areas and how Free Software can make a difference.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="/freesoftware/democracy.html">Democracy</a></strong>:
        technology greatly influences today's society. That is why control over
        technology has to be in the hands of everybody, not just a small group.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="/activities/os/">Open Standards</a></strong>: Open
        Standards allow people to share all kinds of data freely and with
        perfect fidelity. They prevent lock-in and other artificial barriers to
        interoperability, and promote choice between vendors and technology
        solutions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="/activities/education/">Education</a></strong>: Free
        Software is pedagogically superior, its basic spirit involving freedom
        and cooperation is the same spirit of education in a democratic
        environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="/activities/procurement/">Public
        Procurement</a></strong>: Free Software is a perfect fit for the public
        sector. It is a public resource that government organisations can use,
        study, improve, and share with each other. For citizens, this means
        transparency, cost efficiency, and the freedom to interact with their
        government in the way that suits them best.
