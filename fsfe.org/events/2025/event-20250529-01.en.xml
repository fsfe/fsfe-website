      <p>Weâ€™re excited to launch Refund4Freedom, a new campaign defending your rights to choose your operating system and claim refunds for unused pre-installed software.<br />
Join us on May 29, 2025, as we kick off this important initiative that promotes device neutrality, consumer rights, and software freedom.<br />
Learn how you can take action, share your story, get involved and help push manufacturers toward fairer, more transparent practices. Letâ€™s stand up for our freedom together!<br />
