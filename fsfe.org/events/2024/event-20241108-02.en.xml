      <p>Our smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other connected devices are general purpose computers. However, device manufacturers, vendors, and internet platforms have been restricting software freedom by exercising their monopolistic control over end-user equipment. Basic freedoms such as installing and uninstalling software are being unfairly limited by these companies, commonly referred to as “gatekeepers”, because of their monopolistic control over devices.</p>
     <p>Lucas Lasota from the FSFE will present Device Neutrality as a policy solution to enable end-users to bypass gatekeepers in order to run Free Software independently of the control exercised by hardware manufacturers, vendors, and platforms. Device Neutrality can enable end–users to regain control over their devices.</p>
