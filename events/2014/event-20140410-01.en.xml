    <title>Berlin Fellowship Meeting with the topic "Security in and by Free Software" in Berlin, Germany</title>
   <body>
    On Thursday, April 10, there will be the next Berlin Fellowship meeting, as usual in the e-lok (near Ostkreuz). This time, Michael aka "Majestyx" will tell us about security by using Free Sofware as well as in the use of Free Software. Before his talk there is a monthly review of FSFE's activities, after the talk we come together for a drink.

    As usual, the Fellowship meeting is a good possibility to meet other Fellows as well as other Free Software enthusiasts. You can get good food and best drinks at e-lok for a reasonable price and good mood for no cost. Official start is at 19:30.
