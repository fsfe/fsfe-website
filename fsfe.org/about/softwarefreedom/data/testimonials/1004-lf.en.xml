    “Free Software means much more than writing code. It's a philosophy about building inclusive communities and societies. It's about sharing and evolving through open access and open science.

	During these four decades, Free/Libre Software has become our best ally to achieve universal access to non-negotiable human rights such as education and healthcare. It has also been our best friend to safeguard our privacy as individuals.
	Now I dream about the universal adoption of Free/Libre Software in our public administrations, hospitals, research institutions and schools. It's only up to us to make this dream a reality. 

	In the 40th anniversary of the GNU project, let's all celebrate and be proud of this movement’s achievements!"
