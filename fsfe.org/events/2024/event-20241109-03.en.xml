      <p>The Fediverse is a decentralised social network. But what does that mean?<br/>
In this talk Tobias Diekershoff from the FSFE will give a short introduction to the Fediverse of 2024 and how it started to evolve in 2008. He will explain the basic concepts of ActivityPub as the protocol of the Fediverse and how the use of this open protocol has enabled a diverse group of Free Software projects to build a social network of (micro) blogging, video streaming, podcasting and event organising. A network where users can share and interact with each other regardless of the platform they use. What will be possible in the Fediverse of 2024? And how can you get started today?</p>
