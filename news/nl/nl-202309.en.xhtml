<h1>"Back to school" for EU and German policy+++Ada available worldwide</h1>

<p>
September brings the resumption of EU politics and the mid-term of the 
current German government, and we look at them from a Free Software 
perspective. ‘Ada &amp; Zangemann' can now be ordered internationally, 
and you can help us translate our 'What is Free Software' video into 
more EU languages. And remember - rooting your device does not void its 
warranty.

<h3 id="#Halftime-for-the-German-government-Thank-you-for-the-fine-words-now-let-the-deeds-speak">Halftime for the German government: Thank you for the fine words, now let the deeds speak!</h3>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), together with an 
alliance of civil society and the Free Software industry, calls on the 
German government to <a href="/news/2023/news-20230829-01.html">implement a sustainable digital policy</a> 
and to provide the necessary funds in the federal budget now.</p>

         
<h3 id="Liability-Interoperability-&amp;-Free-Software-in-EU-what-we-are-expecting">Liability, Interoperability &amp; Free Software in EU: what we are expecting</h3>
 
<p>After the summer recess, EU institutions are resuming their 
activities at the end of August. In the coming months, we expect to see 
the adoption of legislation that could have an impact on Free Software: 
the Cyber Resilience Act, the Product Liability Directive, the AI Act, 
and the Interoperable Europe Act. <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230824-01.html">What does all this legislation 
mean 
for Free Software and its community?</a>.</p>

<h3 id="#Ada-&amp;-Zangemann-available-now-in-English-worldwide">‘Ada 
&amp; Zangemann’ – available now in English worldwide</h3> 
<p>From 29 August the English version of the book <a 
href="/activities/ada-zangemann/index.html">"Ada &amp; Zangemann - A 
Tale of 
Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream"</a> is  <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230831-01.html">available 
internationally</a>. The book tells the story of the famous inventor 
Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to 
experiment with hardware and software and realises how important it is 
for her and others to control technology.</p>

 <p>As users we sometimes face the issue of rooting our devices. We may 
 want to regain control of our device or we may want to keep using a 
 device with an outdated operating system. But we are afraid of losing 
 our legal warranty. Let’s be clear: Just rooting your device and 
 installing new software <a href="/news/2023/news-20230807-01.html">will not void the statutory warranty</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Take-Action-Contribute-to-translate-our-What-is-Free-Software-video">Take Action! Contribute to translate our ‘What is Free Software’ video</h3> 

<p>If you read our email, you already know this. We want to translate 
our video <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/p/9gYSyoEYggsqBExLWjRejL">"What is Free 
Software"</a> into more European languages! This 
video explains in less than 3 minutes why Free Software is important, 
and each translation costs about 250 Euros. Therefore, all 
contributions until the end of September will be used to help our 
community in Europe to get the video in their native language. Help us 
spreading this message or <a href="/donate/donate.html">making a small contribution</a> to support this 
campaign!</p>
