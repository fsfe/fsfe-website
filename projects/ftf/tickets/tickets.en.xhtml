    <h1>The European Legal Network Conference - Business Tickets</h1>
     
    <div id="introduction">

    <p>
The European Legal Network Conference is held every year to allow legal experts to discuss the future of Free Software licenses and associated best practice in this field. This has become the world's premier event for debating, discussing and sharing knowledge around Free Software legal affairs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
As in previous years, the primary cost of holding the event is expected to be covered by sponsorship.  However, FSFE would like to offer attendees a way to support the facilitation of the Legal Network throughout the coming year while attending the conference. This is done through an optional "business ticket" priced at 200 Euro, providing access to our dinner on the night of the 7th and an invoice for accounting purposes. All revenue generated by this ticket will contribute towards the time and other resources consumed in running network communications, projects and events throughout 2011.
    </p>
    
        <p>
You can order your business ticket by credit card, bank transfer or cheque as described below.
