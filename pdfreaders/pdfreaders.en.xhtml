  <p>The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a popular format to publish formatted text and documents. There are several different versions of it, some qualifying as an <a href="os.html">Open Standard</a>, some certified by <a href="http://www.iso.org">ISO</a> and some encumbered by <a href="/activities/swpat/background.en.html">software patents</a>. You might want to promote the versions that are Open Standards, because Open Standards guarantee interoperability, competition and choice. <a href="/freesoftware/standards/standards.en.html">Read more...</a></p>
  
  <p>There are many programs to read and write PDF documents. All of the PDF readers in the following list are <a href="https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/freesoftware.en.html">Free Software</a>, respecting your basic four freedoms to use, study, share and improve them. This gives you control over your computer and helps protect your privacy. <a href="https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/freesoftware.en.html">Read more...</a></p>

  <p>Other proprietary alternatives to Adobe's PDF reader also exist, but like it, their internal working is a trade secret and these programs do not respect your right to control your own privacy and data.</p>
