      <p>Apple is one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world. Its unbalanced power spans over software and devices, trapping end-users and developers in tight lock-ins. This approach has prevented Free Software to flourish in environments controlled by Apple.</p>
     <p>The EU has reacted to Apple's monopolistic practices by passing the Digital Markets Act - a law containing several anti-monopoly obligations against big tech. By designating Apple as a "gatekeeper" of digital markets in the EU, the DMA, the company has now to comply with several rules regarding sideloading, enabling of alternative app stores and interoperability of its operating systems. Apple has put forward an aggressive policy against the DMA. The company started litigation against the Euopean Commission to dodge DMA obligations. </p>
     <p>Due to the high risks against software freedom, the FSFE was granted right to intervene in the case. By demonstrating that Apple is being regulated in light of public interest, the FSFE is proving to the court that interoperability and software freedom are compatible with human rights.</p>
