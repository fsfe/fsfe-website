  <h1>Free software, Free Society</h1>

  <p id="introduction">
  <!-- short text explaning the whys and whereabout --> The most basic
  definition of a society is a group of people related to each other through
  organized relations. Our societies are based on sets of values, on a shared
  culture and shared institutions. Democracy, human rights, gender equality,
  rights of the disadvantaged, freedom of expression, privacy and security, are
  examples of what our societies have achieved and what ought to be
  preserved.</p>

  <p>Proprietary software jeopardize the freedoms of the user in a digital
  world, but also the overall equilibrium of our system based on values that
  Free software - contrary to non-free one- defend.</p>
