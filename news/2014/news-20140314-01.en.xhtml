        <h1>Asian Legal Network launched</h1>
            <p>

Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), Open Invention Network (OIN),
and The Linux Foundation announced today the launch of the Asian Legal
Network. The Asian Legal Network was established to provide a leading
forum for sharing knowledge and best practices regarding Free Software
legal affairs, particularly those that relate to market participants
in Asia.
</p>
<p>
The Asian Legal Networkâ€™s inaugural conference is taking place today,
March 14, 2014.  This by invitation only event - the Asian Legal and
Licensing Workshop - is an important opportunity for members to meet
and discuss the future of the Asian Free Software market from a legal
perspective. The workshop features speeches and discussions with
select lawyers and experts involved in GNU/Linux and Free Software,
including Karsten Gerloff (FSFE), Keith Bergelt (OIN), Linda Biel
(AST), and Xinzhu Zhang (Global Economics Group).
</p>
<p>
The Asian Legal Network complements the
global <a href="/activities/ln/ln.html">Legal Network</a>,
through which FSFE has been facilitating an ongoing conversation among
the world's leading legal experts on Free Software since 2006.
