  <p>Read in our October newsletter about FSF's thirty-fifth anniversary, our
  upcoming participation at SFSCon, our technical job vacancy, and our
  other diverse community activities.</p>

  <h2 id="35-years-fsf">Congratulations to the FSF on its thirty-fifth anniversary</h2>

  <p><a href="https://www.fsf.org/events/fsf35">35 years ago</a>, our sister
  organisation, the <a href="https://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>, was
  founded to work for users' freedoms to use, study, share, and improve
  software with the introductory line that <strong>"Our work will not be
  finished until every computer user is able to do all of their digital tasks
  in complete freedom"</strong>. That is a promise that holds true even after
  thirty-five years of working for software freedom and inspiring countless
  people and many organisations to take a stand for user freedoms. <a
  href="/news/2020/news-20201009-01.html">The FSFE's President, Matthias
  Kirschner, recorded a congratulatory speech</a> in which he reflected on the
  importance the FSF and our movement have had and continue to have over the
  years.</p>

  <h2 id="participation-sfscon">Participation at SFSCon</h2>

  <p>The South Tyrolean Conference for Free Software, SFScon, is one of the
  established annual conferences on Free Software in Europe. In recent years we
  have been represented with lectures, workshops and our information booth.
  Last year we also organised our Community Event in the context of SFSCON, so that
  we could meet our community and also many other interested people, and
  eventually <a href="/news/2019/news-20191205-01.html">reported about our
  work</a>. </p>
			
  <p>Due to the current situation, the 2020 edition of this event can only take
  place in blended mode: both online and at NOI Techpark, for a limited number
  of people. But of course, the FSFE is again contributing to the
  programme.</p>

  </figure>
		     
  <p>We have organised seven lectures in which legal issues are clarified and
  current political developments are analysed. Concrete practical questions
  concerning compliance, for example for SMEs, will be addressed, as well as
  questions about machine learning and problems which arise in the development
  of a "free" smartphone. <a href="/news/2020/news-20201019-01.html">Here you
  find more information on our track and the SFSCon2020</a></p>
	
  <hr/>
  
  <p>The biggest financial impact the FSFE faces in these times of physical
  distancing is the cancellation of Free Software conferences, including our
  own events.  To keep the software freedom movement solid and alive, please
  consider <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate?referrer=nl">donating a part of
  your conference budget to Free Software organisations, including the
  FSFE</a>.</p>
