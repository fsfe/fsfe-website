<h1 id="fsfe-newsletter-june-2019">FSFE Newsletter June 2019</h1>
<p>This month's newsletter highlights the Google/Huawei case and the greater picture it reveals to us. In the Get Active section we call for your proactivity in promoting the use of Free Software. Additionally, you can find out what happened at our Web-a-thon in Frankfurt am Main and view some media of the actions we have taken for promoting and increasing the awareness of Free Software to the wider audience, as well as see what's planned for the near future, where you can take part in.</p>

<h2 id="the-google-huawei-lessons">The Google - Huawei Lessons</h2>
<p>Last month, Google blacklisted and blocked Huawei from accessing all its proprietary components of the Android mobile operating system. The California based tech giant had to comply with the executive order issued by the U.S. government to effectively ban all American companies from trading with Huawei. 
While the Chinese telco will not have access to Google's proprietary components, it will nevertheless be able to use those parts of Android's operating system available under the open source licence, which is free for anyone to use. This highlights the importance that Free Software has for users, public bodies, and businesses. The Free Software Foundation Europe presented three essential lessons from this case:</p>

<ol> 
	<li>Free Software enables control over technology: The more important technology becomes in our daily lives, the more relevant Free Software becomes for individual users.</li>

	<li>The EU is overly reliant on foreign sources of technology: The European Union and its member states should invest in Free Software development and focus on supporting local Free Software organisations and businesses. This can foster greater technological independence for the EU economy. </li>

	<li>Free Software gives companies technological independence.: A company that uses proprietary software is dependent on such software's vendor and the government that regulates it. The best strategy for a company to avoid this is to use as much Free Software as possible in their supply chains. </li>
	
</ol>

<p>Read more details about these lessons in our <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2019/news-20190520-01.en.html">press release</a>.</p>

If you are interested in seeing us in action and join our cause, keep in mind the following dates and locations in the coming few months:</p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-done-inside-and-outside-the-fsfe">What have we done? Inside and Outside the FSFE</h2>
<p>Since the last newsletter we have been very active in promoting the Free Software cause, by helping individuals and organisations have a better understanding of what Free Software is and encouraging them to develop and implement it in their lives. We want to share with you the events we have photos and videos for, below:</p>

<li>Between May 24th and 26th, the FSFE ran our <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/2019/0525-fsfe-web-a-thon">web-a-thon 2019</a>. There were 13 hackers (and more in the evenings) who met in Frankfurt (Main) to work on the FSFE's website, and of course to also celebrate our nice community and commemorate <a href="https://mastodon.social/@3rik/102155847488969972">International Towel Day</a>. We aimed high and tried to get rid of many unresolved issues, some rather small, some highly important for editors, translators and of course our visitors. In the milestone <a href="https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/fsfe-website/milestone/10?state=closed">"Hackathon1905"</a>, we collected the issues to be worked on, and it turns out that we achieved more than we anticipated. 47 tickets and pull requests have been closed successfully. Thanks to everyone who participated, maintained the good mood throughout  and to the <a href="https://ccc-ffm.de/">CCC FFM</a> for hosting us patiently during  the whole weekend!</li>

<p>Do you remember that some years ago the German newspaper Die Tageszeitung (TAZ) <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2013/news-20130327-01.en.html">received the Document Freedom Day Award</a> for delivering its electronic paper to its subscribers in a choice of open formats, and without <a href="https://drm.info/">digital restrictions (DRM)</a>?
This year, the TAZ newspaper went a step further and even launched their <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.thecode.android.tazreader/"> taz.app on f-droid</a> under a Free Software license. This is a great example for other newspapers to follow. Contact your favourite newspaper and demand they follow the TAZ's example of giving users freedom of choice and technical control.</p>
