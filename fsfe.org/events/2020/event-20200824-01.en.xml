    <body>
      <p>On 28 August the FSFE's president, Matthias Kirschner, will participate in a panel discussion during the Prototype Fund's demo week. The 21 projects of the Prototype Fund's 7th funding round &quot;Engineering Trust - Building Trust&quot; have spent the last six months tinkering, developing, testing, discarding, adapting and finally producing a Free Software prototype. They will present the results of their work during the demo week, an online event taking place from 24 to 28 August. During this week each project will be presented to the public. Furthermore, an opening and a closing event will be held on Monday and Friday, which can be <a href="https://demoweek.prototypefund.de/stream">watched in a live stream</a>. On Friday 28 August from 19:10 to 19:40 CEST, Matthias Kirschner will join a panel with Ann Cathrin Riedel and Michael Weber (Ministry of Education and Research) to discuss if technology can help building trust. The discussion will be in German.</p>
