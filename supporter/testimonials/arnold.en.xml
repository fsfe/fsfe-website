            Free Software needs a voice in politics. We volunteers do amazing 
            things together, but some tasks are not that much fun, or are time 
            sensitive or need extensive expertise. FSFE can only tap its full 
            potential with paid staff to do the things the volunteers wouldn't get 
            to. By now, I met all of the staff and can say that I don't regret a 
            cent I've given to allow the FSFE to operate.
