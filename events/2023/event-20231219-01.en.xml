        <title>FSFE Potteries - Fl√∂rg√•sbord! (A social with 4 free bowling lanes!) in Newcastle-under-Lyme, UK</title>

    <body>
      <p>IMPORTANT!  You must RSVP to attend this event via the FSFE Potteries mailing list or e-mail the organiser directly... questions are also welcome via either method also.</p>

      <p>We've booked a private room in the centre of Newcastle-under-Lyme from 6:30pm GMT onwards until closing... it's upstairs from the Vue cinema and you can find directions if you follow the link.</p>
      <p>There's 4 full sized bowling lanes, all of which are ours for the whole evening for unlimited free play, 6 people at most to a lane.</p>
      <p>It's FREE as we're pickup up the bill, and like our past socials there will be places to just sit and just chat (no loud music!).  Not everyone will be bowling anyway, so don't feel like you have to.  Should be plenty of free software users about for a catch up!</p>
      <p>The venue serves hot food (so no need to eat before coming out) as well as offering drinks (including alcohol)... you'll find details of this on the wiki if you follow the link.</p>
      <p>We're holding this event jointly with the local LUG and Open Rights Group branch, so it's sure to be a great mix of people in one social.  You're welcome to bring friends and family too, but you must let us know exact numbers if possible when you RSVP (as we need to keep the room to under 40 people, which it surely will be anyway... so don't give it a second thought!)</p>
      <p>It's a veritable Fl√∂rg√•sbord! - We were trying to merge the acronyms FSF/LUG/ORG and got &quot;Florg&quot; which got compared to the word Sm√∂rg√•sbord (a Swedish buffet) and so we made it Fl√∂rg√•sbord instead (as a buffet of local technology groups!).</p>
      <p>‚è∞ 6:30pm doors open<br />
üìç Lymelight Lanes, 98-104 High Street, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, ST5 1PT.</p>
