      <p>The Chemnitz Linux Days (CLT) are the largest Free Software conference in Germany. It is a long-standing event for education about Linux and Free Software. The event includes workshops, lectures and beginners&#039; talks in the central building of the Chemnitz University of Technology.</p>
     <p>The FSFE will be present at the CLT 2025 edition with an information booth and serveral talks and presentations: On Saturday at 12:00, the FSFE&#039;s Technical Advisor Florian Snow will talk about &quot;Open system, closed doors: Freedom in Banking&quot; (room V5). At 15:00, Tobias Diekershoff (FSFE System Administrator, Friendica developer) will explore the non-textual areas of the Fediverse (V5). On Sunday at 11:00, Johannes NÃ¤der (FSFE Senior Policy Project Manager)  will shed a light on openwashing, the practice of misleading consumers and public authorities by disguising proprietary software products as Free Software (V7).</p>
     <p>&quot;Ada &amp; Zangemann&quot;, the story about the girl Ada who loves to tinker and bravely stands up to the mighty inventor Zangemann, will play a prominent role at this year&#039;s CLT: The new animated film will be shown on Saturday and Sunday at 14:00 (W1), and a reading will take place on Saturday at 11:00 (Kinderparadies).</p>
     <p>We will host a community meeting at the FSFE booth on Sunday at 12:30. If you&#039;re attending the CLT, be sure to stop by to learn about FSFE&#039;s current activities, get your copy of the Ada &amp; Zangemann book, or get a new hoodie or shirt!</p>
     <p>All the FSFE talks, the screening and the reading will be in German</p>
