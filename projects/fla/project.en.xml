    <description>
      As a European approach to the issues also addressed by the
      Copyright Assignment of the FSF North America, the Fiduciary
      Licence Agreement (FLA) seeks to strengthen the legal fundament
      of Free Software by allowing Free Software authors to make the
      FSFE their fiduciary for all legal issues.
