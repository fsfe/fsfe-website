 <h2><a name="Introduction">1 Introduction</a></h2>

 <h3>1.1 About the Free Software Foundation Europe</h3>

 <p>1. The Free Software Foundation Europe e.V. (&quot;FSF
 Europe&quot;) is a charitable association (e.V. in Germany) dedicated
 to promoting computer users' right to use, study, copy, modify, and
 redistribute computer programs in Europe. The FSF Europe promotes the
 development and use of free (as in freedom) software - particularly
 the GNU operating system - and free (as in freedom)
 documentation. The FSF Europe also helps to spread awareness of the
 ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software.</p>

 <p>2. The FSF Europe is an acknowledged sister organisation of the
 Free Software Foundation (FSF) in Boston, USA, dedicated to the same
 goals.</p>

 <p>3. The FSF (including the FSF Europe) has always observed and
 commented on attempts to lock up the software market and exclude new
 entrants. This includes many actions by Microsoft Corporation
 (&quot;Microsoft&quot;) that are against free competition, sometimes
 directly against the Free Software Movement, but not limited to
 that. The FSF Europe's expertise includes analysing the economic and
 technological effects of such actions on the software market from an
 insider's point of view.</p>

 <p>4. When the FSF Europe became aware of Case No. COMP/C-3/37.792 of
 the European Commission against Microsoft, it applied for status as
 an interested third party. This status was granted on 12 December
 2001. On 27 December 2001, the FSF Europe received the
 non-confidential versions of the Commission's Statements of
 Objections and Microsoft answers. In the present paper, we are
 commenting on Microsoft's response (of 16 November 2001) of the
 second Statement of Objections (of 29 August 2001).</p>

 <h3>1.2 Microsoft and Free Software</h3>

 <p>5. Free software, and in particular the GNU/Linux operating system
 (the GNU system with the Linux kernel added), now holds a substantial
 and increasing share of the operating system market.  Microsoft cited
 this system as its principal competitor and is using various methods
 to attack the Free Software Movement. These attacks are usually
 performed using monopolistic practices similar to those used in the
 conventional software market. We believe that some of Microsoft's
 methods of attack are abusive and should be brought to an end..</p>

 <h2><a name="Markets">2 The Relevant Markets</a></h2>

 <p>6. In &para;&para; 139-143 of its Response to the Second Statement
 of Objections, Microsoft argues against the European Commission's
 definition of the relevant markets..</p>

 <p>7. In contrast, the FSF Europe agrees with the analysis of the
 relevant product markets by the European Commission as stated in the
 Second Statement of Objections, &para;&para; 94-119..</p>

 <p>8. We think that Europe needs to insist that Microsoft allow
 compatible competition for all aspects of their newly introduced
 software products <em>world-wide</em>, not just in Europe, in order
 to get permission to sell them in Europe..</p>

 <p>9. The reason is that the software market is world-wide: If
 Microsoft is the only alternative that people in the USA (say) are
 allowed to use, that can make other alternatives commercially
 unviable everywhere..</p>

 <h2><a name="Interoperability">3 Interoperability</a></h2>

 <p>10. One of the main objections of the EU Commission is Microsoft's
 refusal to disclose information about the network protocols
 (interfaces) necessary to achieve full inter-operability with (a)
 Microsoft's Active Directory Services, (b) Microsoft's version of the
 Kerberos protocol, (c) Microsoft's Encrypted File System, (d)
 Microsoft's Group Policies, and (e) Microsoft's Common Internet File
 System. (See the Second Statement of Objections, &para;&para;
 37-61.).</p>

 <h3>3.1 Microsoft's Strategy</h3>

 <p>11. The Halloween Documents (see <a href="#Halloween">Appendix
 B</a>) give evidence that Microsoft employees tend to suggest to
 extend existing protocols and to develop new, complex protocols with
 the intention to prevent competing free software from entering into
 the market..</p>

 <p>12. Analyses by the developers of the free software Samba and
 Samba-TNG (see <a href="#Samba">Appendix C</a>) indicate that
 Microsoft's protocols are designed in a highly interdependent way:
 Each (proprietary) protocol depends on the correct implementation of
 another (proprietary) protocol to work properly. Full functionality
 and inter-operability can only be achieved when <em>all</em> protocols
 are known..</p>

 <p>13. There are exceptions where Microsoft did disclose some of its
 protocols (see <a href="#SambaInterview">Appendix C.3</a>).  Some of
 these cases occurred where a lack of inter-operability would have
 resulted in a loss for Microsoft. In some other cases, Microsoft
 needed third-party help in order to fix a serious security hole in
 one of its products..</p>
  
 <p>14. If, in some rare cases, disclosure of information was offered
 at all, it was offered under very restrictive licensing conditions
 including non-disclosure agreements which made it impossible to use
 that information in free software..</p>

 <h3>3.2 Possible Results</h3>

 <p>15. <a href="#Death">Appendix D</a> cites an article describing a
 speculative, but possible scenario how Microsoft can extend its
 current dominance from the desktop and workgroup server market to the
 whole Internet - i.e. all server markets - using the same methods as
 those described in the Second Statement of Objections, &para;&para;
 37-61.</p>

 <p>16. We believe the scenario in the article is a possible one.
 Microsoft has already spoken of plans to attack GNU/Linux using
 secret or patented protocols, and it has already implemented a secret
 modified version of the Kerberos protocol.</p>

 <p>17. Of course, the article is speculation. Microsoft may not use
 this particular scheme. It may have been planning to do this but be
 deterred by the publication of this article. In any case, there are
 many other possible variations that could lead to similar
 results.</p>

 <p>18. The European Union is in position to prevent this scheme, and
 other such schemes, through its regulatory mechanisms, if it requires
 that any new Microsoft protocol be published in such a way that
 everyone can implement it without restriction.</p>

 <p>19. Microsoft will no doubt propose to license use of the new
 protocol under some &quot;nondiscriminatory license terms&quot;.
 Such a proposal would be a trap, since these
 &quot;nondiscriminatory&quot; license terms can easily be set up to
 prohibit free software. They would be &quot;nondiscriminatory&quot;
 in the sense that they would offer the same license terms to
 everyone, but these terms would not allow anyone to develop free
 software.</p>

 <h3>3.3 Interoperability between Existing Software Products</h3>

 <p>20. In &para;&para; 10-18, 39, 51-53, 62-70, and 94-97 of its
 Response to the Second Statement of Objections, Microsoft states that
 third-parties did succeed in achieving inter-operability with
 Microsoft's server products, that the work needed to achieve this
 degree of inter-operability was inevitable.</p>

 <p>21. As the developers of Samba can confirm (see <a
 href="#Samba">Appendix Samba</a>), the documentation provided by
 Microsoft was by no means sufficient to achieve this degree of
 inter-operability. Most of the information was obtained by
 reverse-engineering. As a rough estimate, about 100 man-years of work
 could have been saved if the protocols had been sufficiently
 documented.</p>

 <p>22. Furthermore, as even Microsoft admits in &para;&para; 10-17 of
 its Response to the Second Statement of Objections, existing products
 of competitors (including Samba) do not inter-operate seamlessly with
 Microsoft's server products.</p>

 <h3>3.4 Degrees of Interoperability</h3>

 <p>23. According to Microsoft, this reduced (&quot;loose&quot;)
 degree of inter-operability is inevitable between the products of
 different vendors due to differences in design.</p>
  
 <p>24. There is a prominent example which demonstrates that full
 (&quot;tight&quot;) inter-operability is possible even between totally
 different systems of independent vendors: the Internet. The existence
 of the open RfC standards allows, for instance, email clients and
 servers of different vendors to inter-operate seamlessly. The same
 holds for the World Wide Web and a large variety of IP-based
 services.</p>

 <h3>3.5 Third-Parties' Goals</h3>

 <p>25. In &para;&para; 16-19 of its Response to the Second Statement
 of Objections, Microsoft states that the complainants' true interest
 was to profit from Microsoft's innovations.</p>

 <p>26. As programmers who know both Microsoft and its alternatives
 will confirm, Microsoft's software is not particularly technically
 advanced. Other people can write software that is just as good, and
 already do. The only benefit the complainants would get from knowing
 Microsoft's interface specifications is inter-operability.</p>

 <p>27. Once in a while, Microsoft innovates. But Microsoft benefits
 from the innovations of its competitors, including the Free Software
 Movement, all the time. It is only fair that we should be able to use
 their occasional innovations too. That's called
 &quot;progress&quot;.</p>

 <h2><a name="Licensing">4 Discriminatory Licensing</a></h2>

 <p>28. In &para;&para; 82-89 of the Second Statement of Objections,
 the EU Commission describes Microsoft's licensing policy which builds
 momentum for customers to move to Microsoft Windows servers.
 Microsoft's bundling of its Client Access Licences with several
 server products is an abuse, as it restricts the users' freedom to
 run their software (Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional in this case)
 as they deem fit (as a platform for third-party server software in
 this case).</p>

 <h2><a name="Bundling">5 Bundling of the Windows Media Player</a></h2>

 <p>29. In &para;&para; 26 and 125-131, Microsoft claims that bundling
 of the Windows Media Player with the operating system is justified
 because multimedia software is a logical feature of an operating
 system.</p>

 <p>30. If this were the case, the software would have appeared as a
 new part - an &quot;improvement&quot; - of the operating system from
 the very beginning. However, Microsoft's bundling started
 <em>after</em> Microsoft became aware of the fact that a competitor
 was selling the software in question as a separate product.</p>

 <p>31. We observe that Microsoft has redefined the &quot;logical
 features&quot; of an operating system several times: In the 1980s,
 most companies considered, for instance, development and remote
 administration tools logical features of an operating system.
 Microsoft decided to un-bundle these components and to distribute
 them as separate products. This was only possible in a narrowed
 market where no competing operating system already contained these
 important components.</p>

 <h2><a name="Remedies">6 Remedies</a></h2>

 <h3>6.1 Microsoft's Settlement in the USA</h3>

 <p>32. In &para; 150 of its Response to the Second Statement of
 Objections, Microsoft states that according to their Settlement with
 the Department of Justice in the USA, Microsoft is obligated to
 license the client/server protocols to third parties, on reasonable
 and non-discriminatory terms.</p>

 <p>33. According to an analysis by the FSF, our sister organisation
 in the USA, Microsoft's &quot;reasonable and non-discriminatory
 terms&quot; are in fact discriminatory against free software, as they
 require a licensing scheme which is incompatible with that of free
 software (see <a href="#Settlement">Appendix E</a>). Thus,
 Microsoft's settlement in the USA still excludes free software from
 access to the interfaces needed to achieve inter-operability.</p>

 <h3>6.2 Interoperability</h3>

 <p>34. In order to bring the infringements to an end, Microsoft
 should be required to publish their current and future interface
 specifications, without any restrictions or royalty requirements that
 would make it impossible for free software to support them.</p>

 <blockquote>
  &quot;By extending [...] protocols and developing new protocols,
  we can deny OSS projects entry into the market.&quot;
 </blockquote>

 <p>One instance of the method suggested here is Microsoft's refusal

 <h2><a name="Samba">C Samba</a></h2>

 <p>The statements below have been contributed by the developers
 of the server software products Samba (see
 <a href="http://www.samba.org">http://www.samba.org</a>)
 and Samba-TNG (see
 <a href="http://www.samba-tng.org">http://www.samba-tng.org</a>).</p>

 <h3>C.1 A Samba Perspective on Interoperating with Microsoft Windows</h3>

 <p>By Jeremy Allison, Samba development team, 6 January 2002.</p>

 <h4>Background</h4>

 <p>Samba is an Open Source/Free Software (for details, see:
 <a href="http://www.opensource.org">http://www.opensource.org</a>
 and <a href="http://www.fsf.org">http://www.fsf.org</a>) project
 that provides basic file and print services from non-Microsoft
 based server computers to Microsoft Windows based desktop
 computers. It is created by a worldwide group of engineers known
 collectively as the Samba Team. Recently we have expanded Samba
 into providing authentication services to Windows desktops. The
 Samba project Web home page is at
 <a href="http://www.samba.org">http://www.samba.org</a>.</p>

 <p>Samba is a successful Open Source/Free Software project, shipped
 in products by companies such as IBM, HP, Sun, SGI, Veritas and
 many other smaller vendors. Samba is probably the most widely used
 non-Microsoft file and print server for Windows clients.</p>

 <p>Samba code has been communicating with Microsoft Windows operating
 system based computers over computer networks for nearly ten years
 now. During this time we have had some interactions with Microsoft
 management and engineers to attempt to obtain the information we
 need to successfully create an inter-operable product with Microsoft
 Windows operating systems.</p>

 <h4>Interoperating with Windows</h4>

 <p>Writing software code to inter-operate successfully with Windows
 computers is a very difficult task. Note this is very different from
 writing software code that runs on Windows computers. In public
 relations exercises Microsoft likes to claim that all the API's
 (Application Programming Interfaces, the way third party software
 code running on a platform talks to the platform, such as Windows)
 are documented and available to the public. This may or may not be
 true.  However, it is irrelevant to code like Samba that does not run
 on Microsoft Windows based systems, but needs to communicate with
 them over a computer network.</p>

 <p>In order for Samba to be successful in working with Microsoft
 Windows computers over a network, we do not need documented API's, we
 need documented protocols. Protocols are the key to successful
 computer networking. Just as a common Internet was not possible
 before an open and fully documented communication system (the TCP/IP
 protocol) was adopted by all computers, communication with Microsoft
 Windows computers is only possible if open and documented protocols
 are used.  Microsoft understands this, and proudly claims that
 Windows supports many open and published protocol communication
 standards, such as TCP/IP and HTTP (the protocol used on the Web). In
 recent Microsoft Windows releases such as Windows 2000 and Windows XP
 they have claimed they are replacing older proprietary protocols such
 as their authentication system with more open versions of the same
 thing such as the MIT Kerberos (<a
 href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/">http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/</a>)
 protocol, implementations of which are also developed in Europe as
 the Heimdal project (<a
 href="http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/">http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/</a>).</p>

 <p>These claims do not tell the full story however.</p>

 <h4>Microsoft's Web of Interconnected Protocols</h4>

 <p>In order to communicate on a network with Microsoft Windows
 computers, Microsoft Windows mix open and proprietary protocols
 together in an interdependent web which makes it impossible to use
 purely the open and documented protocols to create products that have
 the same features and functionality as the Microsoft ones, giving a
 competitive advantage to Microsoft products and allowing them to
 attempt to leverage their desktop monopoly into a server
 monopoly.</p>

 <p>A good analogy would be with the old USA telephone system, a
 monopoly run by the Bell company. Imagine the Bell company had
 documented the method of sending voice signals over their telephone
 lines, but not the dialing and switching protocols used to initiate
 and route telephone calls. Groups attempting to make inter-operable
 telephones would then either be forced to spend significant time and
 effort reverse engineering these Bell proprietary protocols, or to
 license them from the Bell company. Like Microsoft, Bell would claim
 that &quot;their networking protocols are open&quot;, which on the
 surface appears true.</p>

 <p>The Samba Team have worked out many of these protocols in order to
 create Samba, but there are still many more protocols needed in order
 to enable Samba and other products to seamlessly work with Microsoft
 Windows computers. Until these protocols are published, it will
 always be easier to use Microsoft Windows desktops solely with
 Microsoft Windows servers, thus enabling Microsoft to leverage its
 monopoly from the desktop client space into the server space.</p>

 <p>In addition, Microsoft does not stand still in extending and
 adding to these proprietary protocols in order to make the
 inter-operability task more difficult as time goes on.</p>
 
 <h4>File and Print services background</h4>

 <p>Microsoft file and print services were created for a product
 called Microsoft LanManager, which competed with the then-dominant
 Novell Netware networking product. Microsoft's initial efforts in
 this space were not well received, and Microsoft published a
 specification for their basic file and print protocols as an X/Open
 specification, <a
 href="http://www.opengroup.org/products/publications/catalog/c209.htm">http://www.opengroup.org/products/publications/catalog/c209.htm</a>.</p>

 <p>This was the initial specification that Samba was based upon.
 However, even this documentation was incomplete (no coverage of
 authentication) and did not cover the &quot;browsing&quot;
 protocols needed to create the Microsoft &quot;Network
 Neighborhood&quot; concept. Also, there was no coverage of the (at
 that time) Microsoft OS/2 extensions to provide support for
 filenames longer than the 12 character limitation in MS-DOS (the
 familiar 8.3 names), or coverage of the printing mechanisms used
 (an obsolete variant was documented instead).</p>

 <p>This protocol, called SMB (for Server Message Block) is the
 basis for all Microsoft file and print services. However, this
 original document was enough to get programmers started on writing
 a Microsoft file and print server although it did not cover many of
 the necessary details. The protocol has since been renamed as CIFS
 (Common Internet File System) by Microsoft, the rest of this
 document will refer to it by this name.</p>

 <p>Since then, this document has been taken over by the CIFS working
 group of the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA, <a
 href="http://www.snia.org">http://www.snia.org</a>) and has been
 extended to include many of the needed details to create a working
 Microsoft compatible basic file and print server.  Microsoft's
 participation in this (although a SNIA member) has not been one as an
 equal, but rather as the &quot;owner&quot; of the specification. Most
 importantly, they reserve the right to make changes at any time and
 without notice, as indeed they have done in the past. This makes the
 CIFS protocol specification very different and far less useful than
 the protocols standardised by the Internet Engineering Task Force
 (IETF, <a href="http://www.ietf.org">http://www.ietf.org</a> which
 are true industry collaborations.</p>

 <p>The big change in proprietary protocols came with the release of
 Microsoft Windows NT. Windows NT added much new functionality on
 top of the basic file and print mechanisms, such as:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>A new encrypted authentication mechanism.</li>
  <li>A new print mechanism.</li>
  <li>A new naming mechanism (WINS).</li>
  <li>A new Access control mechanism for files and printers.</li>
 </ul>

<p> Many new remote administration protocols for controlling services,
 logins, current file and print activity - anything remotely
 controllable on a Windows NT machine was made available via these
 proprietary protocols.</p>

 <p>Leveraging the work of open protocols, the underlying basis of
 all these new proprietary protocols was an open and documented
 protocol known as DCE/RPC (Distributed Computing Architecture /
 Remote Procedure Call). Microsoft added proprietary extensions to
 this for their Lanman authentication mechanism, and to provide
 encrypted transport mechanisms. Note that the DCE/RPC protocols
 already had methods to provide authentication and encryption, based
 on public standards (the DES encryption algorithm). Microsoft chose
 to ignore this work and use a proprietary method instead, thus
 making inter-operability much more difficult without large amounts
 of protocol examination and on-the-wire determination.</p>

 <p>With the release of Windows NT, the bar was raised to create a
 product that has the same functionality as an equivalent
 all-Microsoft solution. New requirements were to discover these new
 protocols to provide such things as single sign-on, probably the
 most compelling feature - the ability to enter a password once to
 authenticate yourself anywhere on the network. Microsoft clients
 require servers supporting these new protocols in order to offer
 the features they are advertised as providing.</p>

 <p>For many years, until the engineering work was done to discover
 these protocols, the only servers capable of providing these
 protocols were Microsoft ones. Samba has now improved (by much
 work) to the point where we can support some of these features (the
 new print mechanism, the encrypted authentication mechanism, the
 naming mechanism, the access control mechanism) but not all of them
 (many of the critical remote administration features are still
 missing).</p>

 <p>Of course, over these years Microsoft has not stood still in
 adding new features to Windows NT/2000/XP, and we now have to deal
 with extensions to provide encrypted file system access, quota
 support (limits on users disk space) and the authentication
 mechanism has been replaced with the more open Kerberos system, but
 with Microsoft proprietary extensions.</p>

 <h4>Connected Protocols and the importance of Interface Definitions</h4>

 <p>Knowing that all these new protocols are based on a standard,
 DCE/RPC doesn't help at all unless you know how the new feature
 requests (the &quot;calls&quot; in RPC parlance) are sent over the
 standard. DCE/RPC is merely a transport mechanism for sending
 requests to a remote machine and receiving replies from the target.
 In order to specify what these requests mean, DCE/RPC uses a method
 called &quot;Interface Definition Language&quot; (known as IDL) to
 specify the requests (themselves a new protocol) that are sent
 between clients and servers.</p>

 <p>Each service provided by Microsoft servers has an associated
 description, in the IDL language, that completely describes how to
 send and receive these requests over the network, on top of the
 DCE/RPC protocol.</p>

 <p>These IDL descriptions are <em>key</em> for providing
 inter-operability with Microsoft clients. If these IDL descriptions
 were published, open and equal inter-operability with Microsoft
 products would be greatly enhanced (although still not perfect).</p>

 <p>Knowing this, the Samba Team requested these IDL definitions from
 Microsoft at the CIFS industry conference in Santa Cruz in October of
 1998. The Microsoft representative present, Paul Leech, responded
 that this was considered a Microsoft proprietary advantage, and the
 IDL definitions would not be released.</p>

 <p>Undeterred, we have requested the IDL definitions from the
 Microsoft representative at every CIFS industry conference (held
 annually) since 1998, most recently from the Microsoft VP of Windows
 Base OS, Rob Short at the 2001 CIFS conference in Redmond,
 Washington. The response we received was the same we have always
 received, that is &quot;we'll get back to you on this&quot;. No
 follow-ups have ever been received to these requests.</p>

 <p>Other than these refusals, Microsoft has been ambivalent towards
 the creation of Samba. Contact with Microsoft engineering staff is
 generally cordial and helpful, although they are not allowed by
 management to tell us the protocol details we really need to know in
 order to fully inter-operate. The reports we receive from companies
 using Samba who are exposed to Microsoft marketing is that of extreme
 hostility, to the extent of threatening retaliation if use of Samba
 is discussed publicly in press releases. These reports are similar to
 those already exposed publicly in the DoJ investigation of
 Microsoft's business practices.</p>

 <h4>Extending authentication - the Kerberos story</h4>

 <p>The original proprietary Lanman and Windows NT authentication
 system has had several security problems. Microsoft solved this with
 Windows 2000 as previously discussed by moving to the standard
 Kerberos authentication system, developed at MIT.</p>

 <p>However, the implementation of Kerberos delivered with Windows
 2000 was extended to tie it to Windows 2000 clients, and to make
 public implementations of the Kerberos protocols, such as the sample
 server published as Open Source/Free Software by MIT, not able to
 serve Microsoft Windows 2000 or Windows XP clients in the same way a
 Microsoft Windows Kerberos server can.</p>

 <p>What they did was to embed extra, Microsoft specific proprietary
 information into the protocol packet used by Kerberos (known as a
 &quot;ticket&quot;). Windows 2000 clients were made dependent upon
 the existence of this extra data within the ticket in order to
 implement &quot;single sign-on&quot;, that is the ability to have one
 network user identification across multiple machines.</p>

 <p>MIT Kerberos servers, which do not provide this information, can
 provide authentication to Windows 2000 and XP client machines, but
 the user authenticated by the non-Microsoft Kerberos server must also
 exist within an account database held on a Microsoft machine.  This
 causes the user account information to be held in more than one
 place, the very problem that single sign-on is designed to avoid.</p>

 <p>Groups wishing to deploy the more secure authentication service
 are forced to implement their account databases on Microsoft servers,
 of face the consequences of not having single sign on available.</p>

 <p>As Samba does not generate Kerberos tickets, but is a consumer of
 them, this extension of the standard protocol doesn't cause us
 problems integrating into a Microsoft network (we just ignore the
 extra data), but it is aimed directly at the MIT and Heimdal
 developers.</p>

 <p>I (Jeremy Allison) publicly requested Microsoft to publish these
 changes to the Kerberos protocol by speaking to Microsoft's Kerberos
 project manager, Peter Brundrett at a Microsoft Professional
 Developers Conference in 1997. Once again, the answer was &quot;we'll
 get back to you on this&quot;. The changes were published in a
 Microsoft Word document that had been modified to include a
 click-through license which required the reader acknowledge that
 these changes were a proprietary Microsoft trade secret and to agree
 not to implement the changes in any code form.  Clearly this is a
 direct attempt to prevent the public MIT Kerberos/Heimdal developers
 from creating a server fully compatible with Microsoft kerberos
 single sign-on clients.</p>

 <h4>Network Attached Storage - Microsoft's next market</h4>

 <p>In order to create a successful Network Attached Storage server
 product with Microsoft clients, many more protocols than Microsoft
 documents or will discuss publicly are needed to create a competitive
 offering. The only way to get this needed information is to license
 it from Microsoft (Network Appliance <a
 href="http://www.netapp.com">http://www.netapp.com</a> has taken this
 route), ship only Microsoft software on your hardware, the decision
 taken by Compaq and other vendors who ship Microsoft's &quot;Server
 Appliance Kit&quot; (<a
 href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/powered/nas/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/powered/nas/default.asp</a>)
 or to attempt to determine the protocols needed yourself (the route
 the Samba Team have taken). The vendors that ship Samba depend on us
 discovering these protocols and shipping timely implementations of
 Microsoft technology within Samba.</p>

 <p>It remains to be seen if Microsoft's entry into this space with
 their server appliance kit will give them the same dominance they
 have achieved in the desktop and groupware server (Microsoft
 Exchange) space. If they are allowed to continue to tie client and
 server products together with proprietary undocumented protocols
 then customers requiring the advertised functionality from
 Microsoft clients will be forced to purchase Microsoft server
 products, and monopoly will have been successfully extended into
 another product space.</p>

 <h3>C.2 Open Letter to Bill Gates</h3>

 <p>By Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton, Samba-TNG development team, 20 October 2001.</p>

 <p>This letter - also available online at <a
 href="http://advogato.org/article/354.html">http://advogato.org/article/354.html</a>
 - was written, in combination with other requests at other times, to
 cover the &quot;all means available&quot; clause of EC directive
 250/90. The author received no reply.</p>

 <pre>
  we're looking at your technology in Windows NT and, as you probably
  know, i am so impressed by it that i would like to interoperate with
  it.  i was wondering, therefore, if you could send me all IDL
  files and other technical information sufficient to implement
  programs such as exchange server and the MAPI API, SQL, NT domains
  version 4 and 5, Active Directory.

  everything, really.

  i have asked this question before, and i did get a response back
  of &quot;no&quot;.  however, that _was_ over a year ago, and i was wondering
  if you'd changed your mind at all.

  also, i do have to apologise in advance because, i have to make
  this message publicly.  the reason for that is that if you still
  say no, then under European Law, Council Directive 91/250/EEC,
  i would be allowed to do a considerable amount of work - far
  more than is sensible - to perform &quot;interoperability&quot; analysis.

  what would _you_ get out of this?  well, ask the team at
  secure&#64;microsoft.com.  whilst i was working on samba, from
  1996 to 1999, you received numerous really rather important
  and obscure security reports.  one of these resulted in the
  deployment of the Netlogon &quot;Schannel&quot; (don't know its real name)
  in NT Service Pack 4.  this was a critical first step to ensuring
  that the entire SAM database would not be decoded by a hostile
  party who had access to BDC - PDC SAM Sync, for example!

  so you would get a full, comprehensive analysis and independent
  testing of all your core-level products.  and that's utterly
  priceless.  and price-tag-free, too.

  now, _why_ should you give us access to technical specifications?
  well, reasons i can think of off the top of my head are:

  - it would generate an incredibly large amount of good-will

  - some of this technology is old enough (DCE/RPC) such that
  it's been in use in Microsoft for so long that the people
  who implemented it originally are retiring, and the &quot;new crowd&quot;
  don't understand it, don't get it, and are implementing &quot;.net&quot;
  instead.

  therefore, it really shouldn't matter: it's nearing the
  end of its life-cycle.  SOAP is All The Rage.  dot net is
  All The Rage.  passport dot com is All The Rage.

  - you've _had_ ten years head-start on this, surely that's
  more than enough to ensure market leadership, can we join in,
  now?  pleeease?

  - releasing some of this info may help reduce market share to
  below a level where the U.S. Dept of Justice will not bother you
  again.

  anyway, i hope to hear from you soon, but if i don't,
  that's okay too.

  many thanks,

  luke

 <h2><a name="SambaInterview">C.3 An Interview with the Developers of Samba and Samba-TNG</a></h2>

 <p>By Dr. Peter Gerwinski, FSF Europe.</p>

 <p>In January 2002, I asked the developers of Samba and Samba-TNG
 about their co-operation with Microsoft concerning inter-operability
 of their respective products. This article is a summary of their
 answers.</p>

 <p><b>Dr. Andrew Tridgell</b> and <b>Andrew Bartlett</b> have been
 working in the Samba development team on adding Active Directory
 support to Samba 3.0.</p>

 <ul>

  <li>Interoperability between Samba and Windows is currently far from
   being seamless.</li>

  <li>Microsoft has published some information on how a Unix-like
   system can add itself to an Active Directory domain.</li>

  <li>The small amount of documentation from Microsoft on the CIFS/SMB
   protocol is completely inadequate for an inter-operable
   implementation. Without this documentation other vendors,
   including the Samba Team, are forced to spend an enormous amount
   of time on network reverse-engineering of basic elements of the
   protocol.</li>

  <li>Microsoft provides some online documentation for its Kerberos
   PAC extensions, but in order to get access to it, one must
   accept a license whose restrictions render the documentation
   useless for most software projects, including Samba.</li>

  <li>There is no protocol-level documentation for NT4 domains.
   Microsoft sometimes claims that NT4 domains are documented, but
   what they are referring to is the API documentation, which is
   almost completely useless for non-Windows implementations.</li>

  <li>Most of the information needed to achieve inter-operability was
   obtained by network reverse-engineering.</li>

  <li>In many cases, Microsoft creates complex protocols that make
   network reverse-engineering difficult. It considers the
   protocols its own private property and refuses to co-operate with
   other vendors on standardisation, especially when non-Windows
   platforms are involved.</li>

 </ul>

 <p><b>Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton</b> was the person in the Samba
 team who has been responsible for the NamedPipes, DCE/RPC support,
 DCE/RPC services, NTLMSSP etc. that are essential to providing
 Windows NT 4.0 Domains and furthermore are still essential as
 support to Windows 2000 Domains. He is the author of the book
 &quot;DCE/RPC over SMB: Samba and Windows NT Domain
 Internals&quot;, ISBN 1578701503 by MTP (New Riders Group) which
 documents about 6-7 years of his work on Samba. Today he works on a
 new project, &quot;Samba-TNG&quot;, which aims to be a successor of
 Samba.</p>

 <ul>
  <li>In July 1997, Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton followed the
   guidelines as outlined in 90/EC/250 &quot;to obtain information by
   means other than reverse-engineering&quot;. He has been asking
   Microsoft for the necessary information to obtain
   inter-operability for two months. He got no reply. </li>

  <li>In early 2000 he asked Microsoft for the information necessary
   to obtain inter-operability with Windows 2000 Domains. The reply
   was that this information will definitely not be made available.</li>

  <li>Consequently, most of the information published in the book was
   obtained by network reverse-engineering.</li>

  <li>This network reverse-engineering brought some security holes in
   Windows NT to light which were reported to Microsoft. As a
   result of the security fixes, the information obtained by
   network reverse-engineering was no longer true. In order to find
   out the new specifications needed to gain back inter-operability,
   Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton had <em>again</em> to follow the
   90/EC/250 guidelines, and finally had <em>again</em> to obtain
   the information by network reverse-engineering.</li>

  <li>In one exceptional case, Microsoft itself was in need of an
   upgrade to Samba and gave the developers some information which
   saved them about two months of time.</li>

  <li>The protocols designed by Microsoft are highly dependent on each
   other. They form five levels of - all undocumented - protocols
   which are <em>all</em> needed to get seamless inter-operation. In
   other words: Microsoft's protocols are designed to make
   inter-operation difficult.</li>

 </ul>

 <h2><a name="Death">D The Death of TCP/IP<br /> 
Why the Age of Internet Innocence is Over</a></h2>

 <p>By Robert X. Cringely.</p>

 <p>2 August 2001,
 <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010802.html">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010802.html</a></p>

 <p>As events of the last several weeks have shown, Microsoft Windows,
 e-mail and the Internet create the perfect breeding ground for virus
 attacks. They don't even have to exploit Windows flaws to be
 effective. Any Visual BASIC programmer with a good understanding of
 how Windows works can write a virus. All that is needed is a cleverly
 titled file attachment payload, and almost anyone can be induced to
 open it, spreading the contagion. It is too darned easy to create
 these programs that can do billions in damage. The only sure way to
 fix the problem is to re-stripe the playing field, to change the game
 to one with all new rules. Some might argue that such a rule change
 calls for the elimination of Microsoft software, but that simply
 isn't likely to happen. It's true that [GNU/]Linux and Apache are
 generally safer than Windows 2000 and IIS, but Microsoft products
 aren't going to go away. I promised you an answer to how to secure
 the Internet, and I mean to come through.  First, we'll start with
 the way I would do it, then follow with a rumor I have heard about
 one way Microsoft might want to do it.</p>

 <p>The wonder of all these Internet security problems is that they
 are continually labeled as &quot;e-mail viruses&quot; or
 &quot;Internet worms,&quot; rather than the more correct designation
 of &quot;Windows viruses&quot; or &quot;Microsoft Outlook
 viruses.&quot; It is to the credit of the Microsoft public relations
 team that Redmond has somehow escaped blame, because nearly all the
 data security problems of recent years have been Windows-specific,
 taking advantage of the glaring security loopholes that exist in
 these Microsoft products. If it were not for Microsoft's carefully
 worded user license agreement, which holds the company blameless for
 absolutely anything, they would probably have been awash in class
 action lawsuits by now.</p>

 <p>Of course, it is not as though Microsoft intended things to be
 this way. No company deliberately designs bad products. But you must
 understand that Microsoft limits its investments to things that will
 enhance a product's market share. Every feature in Windows had to
 pass the litmus test, &quot;Does it increase market share?&quot;
 Putting security safeguards in their products evidently failed the
 litmus test, and therefore weren't added.  While it is true that
 virus authors will target platforms that give them the most bang for
 their programming buck, the Windows platform has virtually no
 security to even slow them down. I believe the lack of security in
 Microsoft software was a deliberate business decision.</p>

 <p>Alas, things are only likely to get worse in the near term. So
 far, we've been lucky in that most virus authors have been impatient
 and want to see the immediate effects of their work. It is far more
 effective to be patient and let the virus spread quietly for
 months. If the virus does nothing, the defense against it will be
 slow and/or too late. If the virus does very little on one's PC (for
 awhile), it won't be discovered easily. It is also possible to make a
 stealth virus. I won't go into specifics for obvious reasons, but if
 you think about how virus detection software works, it isn't hard to
 trip it up.</p>

 <p>Even if 98 percent of the world's computers had current anti-virus
 software (which they don't), the remaining two percent would still be
 millions of devices capable of bringing down the entire Internet if
 infected.</p>

 <p>And now, we have the impending release of Windows XP, and its
 problem of raw TCP/IP socket exposure. As I detailed two weeks ago,
 XP is the first home version of Windows to allow complete access to
 TCP/IP sockets, which can be exploited by viruses to do all sorts of
 damage. Windows XP uses essentially the same TCP/IP software as
 Windows 2000, except that XP lacks 2000's higher-level security
 features. In order to be backward compatible with applications
 written for Windows 95, 98, and ME, Windows XP allows any application
 full access to raw sockets.</p>

 <p>This is dangerous.</p>

 <p>Not only is it dangerous, it is unnecessary. What is wrong with
 telling application developers, &quot;Your application can't have
 access to raw sockets,&quot; or, &quot;When XP ships you need to have
 a non-raw socket version ready for your customers,&quot; or, &quot;If
 your application needs to access raw sockets, these are the security
 rules and interfaces you will have to use&quot;? The bottom line is
 that Microsoft's choice to provide access to raw sockets was based on
 the market share litmus test, period.</p>

 <p>Unless this feature is changed before XP is released, it will mean
 that millions of new computers will be manufactured as perfect little
 virus machines. Virus authors who are anticipating these new PCs will
 be able to pre-position their digital vermin to take advantage of the
 socket flaw as the new machines appear. The result is that, in all
 likelihood, there will be massive data security problems, as well as
 massive damage to files and property, all as a result of Windows
 XP. But as consumers, guess what - we won't even get a
 choice. Microsoft will require the PC makers to install XP in the
 factory. It will come on your PC, and you won't have the choice or
 option to pick something different. When Microsoft issues a new OS,
 it is forced into the market.</p>

 <p>Here is my preferred solution for Internet security. We could
 implement a secure user identity system precisely like telephone
 Caller ID. It would be essentially an Internet ID. All Internet
 transactions could be based on it. Anyone who sends me e-mail can be
 identified. Anything I send can be traced to me. People wouldn't be
 forced to participate, but if they remain anonymous, I might choose
 to block them. I certainly wouldn't accept file attachments from
 them. I know you hate this idea, but I think the Internet needs a
 fingerprint. It does not have to have personal information, but if
 you break the law it can be traced to you. You can choose not to have
 a fingerprint, but then your ability to communicate with others may
 be limited - a price many people may choose to pay.</p>

 <p>I am not opposed to people being anonymous - just to anonymous
 people receiving public assistance. Send all the anonymous love or
 hate mail you like, but don't expect to attach a file.</p>

 <p>And what's with those file attachments, anyway? Replace mail
 clients and APIs with secure models. The new model will not run
 attachments as they do today. E-mail attachments should not have
 access to the e-mail client, APIs, etc. Attachments should not have
 access to the operating system by default. The user should approve
 the use of some APIs, like having to give permission before device
 drivers are updated.</p>

 <p>Any application that wants to send bits onto the Internet must
 first be permitted to do so. Applications would be registered to send
 outgoing traffic. The applications would be limited by function and
 port. You would register your e-mail program as the only application
 that could talk SMTP, POP3, etc. If Microsoft Word wanted to send an
 e-mail, your e-mail program would pop up, ask you to authenticate
 yourself and explicitly send the message. At that point, you would be
 in complete control of what was happening on your PC. For
 mail-enabled applications, there would be an application user account
 registered on the post office. The account would be unique, and
 registered to a unique application.</p>

 <p>If kids want to install an Internet game, the game's IP port would
 be registered and permitted to operate, hopefully by the parent. If
 kids wanted to install an Internet chat program, too bad - it
 wouldn't work if Dad didn't want it to work.</p>

 <p>By default, under this scenario, your PC becomes a TCP/IP
 read-only device. By running applications like Gibson's Zone Alarm
 you can - right now - severely limit the use of TCP/IP by
 applications on your PC. And what happens when you do so?  Everything
 works just fine. So rather than ripping the protocol stack wide open,
 let's do the exact opposite. Restrict access to it.</p>

 <p>The only e-mail activity on my PC should be initiated by me,
 personally. Nothing else should access my address book or send out
 messages without my express permission. Microsoft will of course
 reject the idea, mostly because it will fail the &quot;increase
 market share litmus test.&quot; My answer is, &quot;Microsoft, if you
 do not take responsibility for locking down your APIs, it will become
 obvious to the public and become a detriment to your market
 share.&quot;</p>

 <p>Now to the other approach, the one some people attribute to
 Microsoft. I am not making this up. The story came to me from people
 I have come to trust, and I have looked into it closely enough to
 think it might have some validity. But for the sake of keeping
 lawyers off my back, let's just call it a rumor, and only use it as a
 basis for discussion. To be perfectly clear, I am not claiming that
 the following is true - just that I have heard it from more than one
 source, and think it accurately characterises some past behaviors of
 Microsoft. Perhaps by bringing it into the light, we can ensure that
 Redmond takes a more thoughtful course. I certainly hope it is
 wrong.</p>

 <p>Programmers who ought to be familiar with Microsoft's plans have
 suggested that the real motive for raw socket support is for
 Microsoft to use Windows XP to exploit a bad situation, to
 deliberately make things worse.</p>

 <p>According to these programmers, Microsoft wants to replace TCP/IP
 with a proprietary protocol - a protocol owned by Microsoft - that it
 will tout as being more secure. Actually, the new protocol would
 likely be TCP/IP with some of the reserved fields used as pointers to
 proprietary extensions, quite similar to Vines IP, if you remember
 that product from Banyan Systems. I'll call it TCP/MS.</p>

 <p>How do you push for the acceptance of a new protocol? First, make
 the old one unworkable by placing millions of exploitable TCP/IP
 stacks out on the Net, ready-to-use by any teenage sociopath. When
 the Net slows or crashes, the blame would not be assigned to
 Microsoft. Then ship the new protocol with every new copy of Windows,
 and install it with every Windows Update over the Internet. Zero to
 100 million copies could happen in less than a year, and that year
 could be prior to the new protocol even being announced. It could be
 shipping right now.</p>

 <p>Suppose you are a typical firm that also has some non-Microsoft
 servers. You will want to use this new protocol between your
 Microsoft and non-Microsoft servers. Microsoft could charge Sun
 millions to put TCP/MS on their systems. Microsoft can promise open
 support, but make it financially impractical. Then use it in a
 marketing attack against competitors. Zero-Footprint network drivers,
 ODBC, and MAPI are examples of Microsoft &quot;open&quot; standards
 that took years for non-Microsoft firms to use. Almost anyone who
 would have wanted to use these open standards has been driven out of
 business.  Second part of the push for the new protocol will be from
 AOL/Time-Warner, normally Microsoft's top competitor - but not on
 this issue. AOL isn't really part of the grand vision of the new
 protocol. It's just that if they get more of what they want (paid
 accounts, music and video royalties), they won't object to Microsoft
 pushing for secure authenticated connections.</p>

 <p>Third and most powerful part of the push for Microsoft's new
 protocol will be action by Congress. They'll cite concerns of
 business, and hold up the standard scare tactics of terrorists and
 child pornographers. They want all connections, all packets to be
 traceable.  Say goodbye to TCP/IP and to anonymous connections of any
 kind. Hello to Hailstorm, tracking everything down to the last mile,
 and a more business-friendly Internet with prioritised
 packet-handling.  If this seems like too much infrastructure to
 change, it isn't. Not if the old protocol has been rendered useless
 and the new one can be implemented by an upgrade to your router.
 Vines IP - in many ways the basis for TCP/MS - was sufficiently close
 to regular TCP/IP that most routers only had to have a flash upgrade
 (to IOS, in the case of Cisco) in order to route Vines IP.  This will
 be an inconvenience, sure, but marketing types will see it more like
 another Y2K bug - an opportunity to sell, sell, sell.</p>

 <p>But won't the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) stop it from
 happening? No. The entire basis for setting standards on the Internet
 is to first put the new code in service, and then seek
 standardisation. There are no IETF rules that say 100 million plus
 computers can't run TCP/MS, and there is no deadline for
 standardisation. Once the right 100 million plus computers are
 running the new protocol, Microsoft won't have any reason to seek
 standardisation. Why not? It is Possible, for awhile, to run more
 than one protocol at a time. Take as examples of the coexistence of
 IPX and IP in Netware systems, or AppleTalk and IP in MacOS systems.
 Business will push for the new protocol, and the result will be that
 TCP/MS will become a de facto standard, and Microsoft will own the
 Net.</p>

 <p>And all you have to do to kick it off is implement raw socket
 support in the next shipping version of Windows, with the possible
 bonus of blaming any problems on UNIX code later.</p>

 <p>If business feels a need for the ability to have prioritised
 packet Delivery, and government (plus the Recording Industry
 Association of America) is uncomfortable with the notion of
 untraceable packets and connections, of course Microsoft is going to
 try to fill that niche.  Haven't you noticed how their ads have been
 trying to convince people that Microsoft software is amazingly stable
 and secure, and doesn't need minding? That's the image they're trying
 to build - solid as a bank.</p>

 <p>MS/TCP will ostensibly be a solution to the problems businesses
 are having with the Internet. It will assign priorities to packets.
 It will insure that all connections and packets can be traced,
 authenticated, and monitored. And since all these connections to the
 Internet have to be authenticated to someone, it will likely be
 hooked into a credit card or some sort of account, from which
 Microsoft can extract its price as the gatekeeper for the
 authentication via Hailstorm, Passport and .NET.</p>

 <p>But how will this stop the &quot;I just e-mailed you a virus&quot;
 problem? How does this stop my personal information being sucked out
 of my PC via cookies? It won't. Solving those particular problems is
 not the protocol's real purpose, which is to increase Microsoft's
 market share. It is a marketing concept that will be sold as the
 solution to a problem. It won't really work.</p>

 <h2><a name="Settlement">Statement by the FSF about the Settlement in the USA</a></h2>

 <p>The Microsoft Proposed Judgment has been designed by Microsoft to
 make its provisions useless or worse for free software. The following
 are the specific provisions of the Judgment to which the Foundation
 will be formally objecting in its filing under the Tunney Act, which
 will be made on or before January 28, 2002, and will be available at
 <a href="http://www.fsf.org">http://www.fsf.org</a> and <a
 href="http://moglen.law.columbia.edu">http://moglen.law.columbia.edu</a>.</p>

 <p>Section III(D) of the Judgment provides that:</p>

 <blockquote>
  Starting at the earlier of the release of Service Pack 1 for Windows
  XP or 12 months after the submission of this Final Judgment to the
  Court, Microsoft shall disclose to ISVs, IHVs, IAPs, ICPs, and OEMs,
  for the sole purpose of inter-operating with a Windows Operating
  System Product, via the Microsoft Developer Network
  (&quot;MSDN&quot;) or similar mechanisms, the APIs and related
  Documentation that are used by Microsoft Middleware to inter-operate
  with a Windows Operating System Product.  
 </blockquote>

 <p>The &quot;sole purpose&quot; requirement means that Microsoft does
 not have to make any such API information available to developers of
 software like WINE whose purpose it is to make a non-Microsoft OS
 inter-operable with applications written for Windows. This therefore
 excludes all measures to assist GNU/Linux to inter-operate with
 applications written for Windows, which would provide maximum
 competition in the OS market, which should be the objective of a
 competition-law remedy.</p>

 <p>Section III(E) of the Judgment provides that:</p>

 <blockquote>
  Starting nine months after the submission of this proposed Final
  Judgment to the Court, Microsoft shall make available for use by
  third parties, for the sole purpose of inter-operating with a Windows
  Operating System Product, on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms
  (consistent with Section III.I), any Communications Protocol that
  is, on or after the date this Final Judgment is submitted to the
  Court, (i) implemented in a Windows Operating System Product
  installed on a client computer, and (ii) used to inter-operate
  natively (i.e., without the addition of software code to the client
  or server operating system products) with Windows 2000 Server or
  products marketed as its successors installed on a server computer.
 </blockquote>

 <p>This provision too means that GNU/Linux software developers are
 not going to have access to information about protocols implemented
 in Windows.</p>

 <p>Under III(I), the Judgment requires that</p>

 <blockquote>
  Microsoft shall offer to license to ISVs, IHVs, IAPs, ICPs, and
  OEMs any intellectual property rights owned or licensable by
  Microsoft that are required to exercise any of the options or
  alternatives expressly provided to them under this Final
  Judgment
 </blockquote>

 <p>GNU/Linux developers have no rights under III(D) or (E) and thus
 are not entitled to license any rights from Microsoft.  Even if
 they were, however, III(I) only gives those rights provided that:</p>

 <blockquote>
  <p>1. all terms, including royalties or other payment of monetary
   consideration, are reasonable and non-discriminatory;</p>
  <p>
   2. the scope of any such license (and the intellectual property
   rights licensed thereunder) need be no broader than is necessary to
   ensure that an ISV, IHV, IAP, ICP or OEM is able to exercise the
   options or alternatives expressly provided under this Final
   Judgment (e.g., an ISV's, IHV's, IAP's, ICP's and OEM's option to
   promote Non-Microsoft Middleware Products shall not confer any
   rights to any Microsoft intellectual property rights infringed by
   that Non-Microsoft Middleware Product);</p>
  <p>
   3. an ISV's, IHV's, IAP's, ICP's, or OEM's rights may be
   conditioned on its not assigning, transferring or sub-licensing its
   rights under any license granted under this provision;</p>
  <p>
   4. the terms of any license granted under this section are in all
   respects consistent with the express terms of this Final Judgment;
   and</p>
  <p>
   5. an ISV, IHV, IAP, ICP, or OEM may be required to grant to
   Microsoft on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms a license to
   any intellectual property rights it may have relating to the
   exercise of their options or alternatives provided by this Final
   Judgment; the scope of such license shall be no broader than is
   necessary to insure that Microsoft can provide such options or
   alternatives.</p>
  <p>
   Beyond the express terms of any license granted by Microsoft
   pursuant to this section, this Final Judgment does not, directly
   or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, confer any rights,
   licenses, covenants or immunities with regard to any Microsoft
   intellectual property to anyone.</p>
 </blockquote>

 <p>Here subsection (1), which establishes so-called
 &quot;reasonable and nondiscriminatory&quot; licensing, means only
 certain wealthy developers would be entitled to Microsoft API
 information.  Sub (2) repeats that no license will be given to any
 information for purposes except inter-operability with Microsoft
 OSs.  Sub (3) means that Microsoft can use licenses which prohibit
 implementing any of their APIs in GPL'd software, because they can
 refuse to permit any relicensing to downstream users, which GPL
 requires.  The final paragraph is intended to prevent us from ever
 arguing in future that the &quot;nondiscriminatory&quot; clause or
 any other part of this Judgment establishes an equitable right in
 free software developers to have access to Microsoft API
 information.</p>

 <p>Section III(J) of the Judgment says:</p>

 <blockquote>
  <p>J. No provision of this Final Judgment shall:</p>
  <p>
   1. Require Microsoft to document, disclose or license to third
   parties: (a) portions of APIs or Documentation or portions or
   layers of Communications Protocols the disclosure of which would
   compromise the security of anti-piracy, anti-virus, software
   licensing, digital rights management, encryption or authentication
   systems, including without limitation, keys, authorisation tokens
   or enforcement criteria; or (b) any API, interface or other
   information related to any Microsoft product if lawfully directed
   not to do so by a governmental agency of competent
   jurisdiction.</p>
  <p>
   2. Prevent Microsoft from conditioning any license of any API,
   Documentation or Communications Protocol related to anti-piracy
   systems, anti-virus technologies, license enforcement mechanisms,
   authentication/authorisation security, or third party intellectual
   property protection mechanisms of any Microsoft product to any
   person or entity on the requirement that the licensee: (a) has no
   history of software counterfeiting or piracy or willful violation
   of intellectual property rights, (b) has a reasonable business need
   for the API, Documentation or Communications Protocol for a planned
   or shipping product, (c) meets reasonable, objective standards
   established by Microsoft for certifying the authenticity and
   viability of its business, (d) agrees to submit, at its own
   expense, any computer program using such APIs, Documentation or
   Communication Protocols to third-party verification, approved by
   Microsoft, to test for and ensure verification and compliance with
   Microsoft specifications for use of the API or interface, which
   specifications shall be related to proper operation and integrity
   of the systems and mechanisms identified in this paragraph.</p>
 </blockquote>

 <p>Because the phrase &quot;authentication/authorisation
 security&quot; is so broad, Microsoft can refuse to give any
 developer of &quot;Middleware&quot; meant to secure inter-operation
 of free software with .NET any information whatever, or condition
 the grant on its own decision about the &quot;commercial
 viability&quot; of the firm. The GNOME Foundation, FSF, dotGNU,
 and all other non-profits would of course be entirely excluded.
 And Microsoft can claim a government-blessed monopoly over all DRM
 technology it dreams up with the content oligarchs, thus excluding
 all free software OSs from the world of multimedia altogether,
 which would make both Microsoft and Hollywood very happy.</p>

 <p>In short, the Proposed Judgment is a strategic attack on all the
 most crucial points, a critical part of Microsoft's campaign
 against free software. It doesn't just fail the Government's own
 objective of increasing competition in the line of commerce where
 the Government proved Microsoft was an illegal monopoly, it
 increases the monopolist's hold by giving blessing to all of
 Microsoft's measures to eliminate its one remaining, unique
 competitor.</p>
