<h1>FSFE signs Dutch manifesto calling for education improvements</h1>

<p>
Students should not have to use proprietary software to participate in the
educational process. The FSFE joins the Dutch coalition ‘Fair Digital
Education’ supporting privacy-respecting solutions involving Free Software in
schools.

<p> 
The Dutch education system increasingly relies on digital systems for teaching.
Currently most of these tools are proprietary software. As a result, students,
parents, and teachers have lost control over their sovereignty and privacy. The
strongly integrated solutions for online collaboration, school
management, computer hardware, and educational content is a stranglehold that is
nearly impossible to escape. It has become a precondition for education to get
a user account at a big-tech company where you are being tracked and having to
use proprietary software. 
</p>

<p>
Concerned parents, teachers, computer engineers, and defenders of digital rights
joined forces to improve the situation. In a Manifesto 
<a href="https://handboek.petities.nl/dl/manifest/manifest.pdf">Bevrijd kinderen uit de digitale wurggreep</a> (NL) the "Coalition Fair Digital Education" describes the situation and calls for
changes on multiple fronts. Privacy of students should be guaranteed,
sovereignty of schools should be restored, students should be thaught skills
instead of products, and systems should be privacy-by-design and Free Software.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Education is an area of concern for the Free Software Foundation
Europe; the situation in the Netherlands is not unique. The FSFE supports
‘<a href="/freesoftware/education/index.html">Free Software in Education</a>’
and the FSFE local group Zurich runs an awareness campaign,
‘<a href="https://lernenwiedieprofis.ch/">Learning like the pros</a>’ that
tackled similar problems in the Swiss educational system.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The FSFE is one of the initial signees of the manifesto. The manifesto is the
starting point of this coalition. Through contacts with teachers, schools,
policymakers and IT vendors, the group aims to enact practical improvements
within the Dutch educational system. The FSFE will continue supporting this new
Dutch effort to lead a change that will benefit future generations. You, too, can

give your support by signing the manifesto</a>.
