    <title>Your data is yours. Selfhosting made easy in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland</title>

    <body>
      <p>The topic of self-hosting is becoming increasingly important due to policies such as EU Article 13 / CH-current ancillary copyright, privacy etc. It is therefore all the more important to make others aware of the problem. Therefore, we offer a workshop on self-hosting. If you want to participate, please register in advance.</p>
