<h1>AI Act and Interoperability +++ Router Freedom Survey +++ Podcasts, YH4F &amp; Ada</h1>

<p> The June issue brings updates on the Interoperable Europe Act and 
the AI Regulation, and the publication of the conclusions of our 
European Router Freedom survey. We were invited to two podcast episodes 
and were the focus of Edri's 'Member in the spotlight'. Check out a 
study on net neutrality regulation and read a lovely story about Ada 
arriving in rural India.</p>

<h3 id="EU-Policy-Interoperable-Europe-Act">EU Policy: 
InteroperableEurope Act </h3>

<p>In May, the Committee of the Regions 
failed to recognise the importance that Free Software has for 
interoperability and thus for digitalisation and innovation while the 
European Parliament's responsible committees voted by a large majority 
to protect Free Software in the AI regulation. The Committee of the 
Regions adopted its opinion on interoperability through the 
Interoperable Europe Act, failing to substantially improve the original 
text and bring up more solid and necessary measures on the role of Free 
Software, forgetting a â€™Free Software firstâ€™ approach.</p>

<h3 id="EU-Parliament-wants-to-protect-Free-Software-in-AI-regulation"> 
EU Parliament wants to protect Free Software in AI regulation </h3>
 
<p>
The European Parliament's lead committees on AI legislation, the 
Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) and the 
Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), voted by 
a large majority in favour of protecting Free Software in the AI 
Regulation. Non-profit organisations and small Free Software projects 
up to the size of micro-enterprises will be largely exempted from this 
regulation.

<h3 id="Survey-European-citizens-demand-Router-Freedom">Survey: 
European citizens demand Router Freedom </h3> 

<p> 
In the <a href="/news/2023/news-20230515-02.html">most comprehensive survey to 
date</a>, end-users from all over Europe shared their experience about 
ISPsâ€™ commercial practices regarding terminal equipment and how Router 
Freedom is affected. The responses have highlighted several obstacles 
to Router Freedom, such as lack of freedom of choice, provider lock-in 
and promotion of equipment running exclusively proprietary software.

<h3 id="Router-Freedom-as-priority-for-the-future-of-Net-Neutrality-regulation">Router 
Freedom as priority for the future of Net Neutrality regulation </h3> 

<p>The EU Commission has published a <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/e1f1154f-ee2f-11ed-a05c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-285823692">study 
on the future of Net Neutrality regulation</a>, confirming Router 
Freedom as a priority for the future implementation of Open Internet in 
Europe. (Recommendation 2, p. 91). The study referred to work done by 
the FSFE (p.11), supporting the conclusions we at the FSFE have been 
advocating in recent years. In particular, national regulators should 
prioritize end-usersâ€™ rights and safeguard freedom of terminal 
equipment for all network types, including fiber (FTTH).

<p>As part of the book <a href="https://publication2023.bits-und-baeume.org/">â€˜Shaping Digital Transformation for a sustainable 
societyâ€™</a>, that puts together 28 contributions from the second Bits &amp; 
BÃ¤ume conference on digitization and sustainability, Lucas Lasota and 
Erik Albers explain how Free Software is key for a more sustainable 
telecom sector by empowering end-users to have more control over 
devices, especially regarding software and hardware artificial 
obsolescence.</p>

<p> We want to reach to our whole society and get our messages and 
demands heard by those who are not part of the Free Software Community. 
That is why you can find us both in federated and decentralized social 
networks but also in proprietary ones. You can find us in <a href="https://mastodon.social/@fsfe">Mastodon</a> and 
<a href="https://twitter.com/fsfe">Twitter</a>, in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/fsfe/">LinkedIn</a> and in <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/">PeerTube</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FreeSoftwareFoundationEurope">Youtube</a>. In this last one we 
have reached 1000 followers, hopefully <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/p/9gYSyoEYggsqBExLWjRejL">helping people to learn more about software freedom</a> who have not heard about it before.
