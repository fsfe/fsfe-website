      <h2>Educational Task Force</h2> 


      <p>
	To speed up and increase communication in the educational
       field, the Free Software Foundation Europe have created an
       educational task force, currently consisting of Hilaire
       Fernandes, Mario Fux, Georg Greve, Aigars Mahinovs, Alessandro
       Rubini, Chritian Selig, Richard Smedley. Our goals are:

      </p>

      <ul>

	<li>
	  networking Free Software in Education efforts and energies
	to connect people, thus avoiding duplication of efforts (i.e.,
	there are three databases with free edu software);
	</li>
	<li>
	  spreading information about Free Software in Education;
	</li>
	<li>
	  spreading information about the importance of software
	freedoms;
	  </li>
	<li>
	  communicating through the <a
	  href="mailto:edu-team@fsfeurope.org">edu-team@fsfeurope.org</a>
	  mailing list.
	</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
	If you want to be part of this effort (which means that you
	are devoted to it, not just observing), we have some
	requirements:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>
	  experience with GNU/Linux, Free Software and education;
	</li>
	<li>
	  a clear "No" to non-free software;
	</li>
	<li>
	  advantageous: previous work in that field;
	</li>
	<li>
	  you should live in Europe (i.e. NA, India and China have
	  their own FSF educational efforts, so please join them if
	  you live there).
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	The task force can be reached via
	edu-team@fsfeurope.org. Currently, we have contacts in France,
	Germany, Italy, Latvia, Switzerland and the UK. I hope that
	we can find ways to receive EU funding and get in touch with
	politicians.
      </p>
