		  <p>You found your way here, because - like us - you care about Free Software and digital civil rights. We need your help to spread the word about the advantages of Free Software, and to explain others why they should care about Freedom, too. Advocating for Free Software is fun and arguably one of the best ways to help the Free Software movement! On this page you find graphics to use and leaflets to be printed by yourself to support and help you in spreading the word. We have a separate page if you search for <a href="spreadtheword.html">professionally printed promotion material by the FSFE</a>, available for no cost.</p>

Feel free to copy, spread and use them as long as you avoid the appearance that - whatever you use it for - is an official product or the official opinion of the FSFE. Thank you very much for promoting Freedom!</p>

			<p class="right grid-70">This is the logo that represents the <a href="/fellowship/">Fellowship of the FSFE</a>. Its name is 'Plussy' and the symbol illustrates a human who stands strong for his freedom. At the same time, the human figure opens his arms to include everyone who shares common goals. Finally, the symbol draws a 'plus', because our movement gets stronger with every single identity. In other words, every one who is joining the Fellowship is a plus in the fight for freedom. That is why it is called 'Plussy'.</p>

		     <p style="font-size:0.8em; margin-left:2em;"><strong>License</strong>: The Fellowship logo (and variations of it) can be used to advertise the Fellowship of the FSFE and in association with any Free Software related activity performed by FSFE Fellows. It can also be incorporated into logos of local Fellowship groups if so desired. However, if you do not have a mandate by FSFE, we ask you not to create the impression that you speak officially for FSFE, or that FSFE has certified or endorsed you to do so in any way.</p>
