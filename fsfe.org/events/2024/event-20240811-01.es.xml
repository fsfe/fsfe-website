      <p>Companies that produce and sell Free Software face a problem: some competitors use unethical and destructive means to compete, making their products cheaper and winning bids. Destructive practices include marketing proprietary software under the guise of being Free Software, whether by using free/open wording, by introducing new licenses that falsely appear to be free, or by imposing additional barriers that make it more difficult to use the freedoms offered by Free Software. For some players, there seems to be no limit to their creativity when it comes to undercutting competitors and winning bids.<br />
The Free Software Foundation Europe has been analyzing these and other problematic market practices over the last few years. In this talk Johannes Näder will take a closer look at them and show why they harm Free Software manufacturers and the Free Software ecosystem. We will then discuss ways to limit the success of such practices.</p>
