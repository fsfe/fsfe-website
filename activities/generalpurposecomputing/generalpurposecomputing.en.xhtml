        <p>For maintaining sustained growth in the development and use of
        software, the broad availability of general purpose computers is
        crucial.  FSFE's goal is to ensure that the owners of IT devices are
        always in full and sole control of them.</p>
      </div>

    <p>Evolving the computer as a general purpose machine over the past
    decades, our society has created a powerful tool to perform all kinds of
    tasks with a single machine. Now IT manufacturers have discovered that they
    may have an economic interest to arbitrarily limit what these machines can
    achieve.</p>

    <p>The entity who eventually controls which software can be executed on a
    device and thus determines the specific functions the device performs,
    ultimately can control any data processed and stored by the device. In
    result, the owner of an IT device may not be in sole control of their own
    data any more.</p>

        With a function called "Secure Boot", which will be deployed in computers starting 2012, manufacturers of IT hardware and software components are striving to get into a position where they permanently control the IT devices they produce.
