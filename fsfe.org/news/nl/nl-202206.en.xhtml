<h1>Municipalities using Free Software +++ PMPC tour in Italy</h1>

  <p>
    In this issue, read about nine administrations innovating and 
    saving money with Free Software, a Dutch coalition calling for fair 
    digital education, and how a sustainable telecom sector is 
    attainable with Free Software. Volunteers organise ‘Public Money?

    In 2020, the city of Bühl in Germany launched <a href="https://konferenz.buehl.digital/">&quot;Palim! 
    Palim!&quot;</a>, a video conferencing platform based on the Free 
    Software &quot;Jitsi Meet&quot;. The city offered the platform to 
    citizens who needed it, and the initiative was well received. Two 
    years later clubs, citizens, and the city itself use &quot;Palim! Palim!&quot; 
    daily.

  <p>
    Other municipalities have also shown interest in the solution. An 
    association of nine administrations that use &#39;Palim! 
    Palim!&#39; have jointly modernised the administration, based on 
    Free Software. Re@di – regional.digital is an inter-communal 
    cooperation of nine southern German cities. Their common needs are 
    met through synergy effects in collaborative development. In an <a 
    href="/news/2022/news-20220602-01.html">interview</a>, Alexander Gabriel and Eduard Itrich 
    shared that the administrations could use their resources 
    cost-efficiently thanks to cooperation and sharing Free Software.

<h2 id="dutch-coalition-calls-for-fair-digital-education">Dutch 
coalition calls for fair digital education</h2>

  <p>
    Students should not have to use proprietary software to participate 
    in the educational process. The FSFE <a href="/news/2022/news-20220520-01.html">joins the Dutch coalition 
    ‘Fair Digital Education’</a> supporting privacy-respecting 
    solutions involving Free Software in schools. The coalition signed 
    a <a href="https://eerlijkdigitaalonderwijs.petities.nl/?locale=en">manifesto</a> 
    calling for more control and fairness in the digital solutions used 
    for education. Students should be taught skills instead of 
    products. Free Software <a href="/freesoftware/education/argumentation.html">increases code 
    literacy and shows the value of cooperation</a>.
  </p>

<h2 id="how-to-attain-a-sustainable-telecom-sector">How to attain a 
sustainable telecom sector</h2>

  <p>
    The right to install any software on any device, Free Software 
    licensing, and Device neutrality serve digital sustainability as 
    well as consumer protection measures. When users can install 
    any software on any device this can make the difference in order to 
    repair the device or reuse it and this way prevent it from becoming 
    e-waste. Users’ right to install any software they want, 
    manufacturers’ obligation to publish the full source code, and 
    Device Neutrality are all necessary to reclaim devices. These 
    principles should guide future policies on product design in the 
    EU. The FSFE made this point <a href="/news/2022/news-20220510-01.html">answering a public 
    consultation</a> about the impact of the telecommunications sector 
    on the environment.
