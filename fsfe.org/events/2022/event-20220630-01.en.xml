      <p>On Thursday 30th of June, Lina Ceballos, FSFE Project Manager will participate in OpenExpoEurope2022 which will take place in person in Madrid, Spain. Lina will talk about REUSE which makes adding and reading licensing and copyright information easy for both humans and machines with three simple steps. REUSE does not "reinvent the wheel". On the contrary, it integrates seamlessly into development processes and other best practices when indicating Free Software licences.</p>
