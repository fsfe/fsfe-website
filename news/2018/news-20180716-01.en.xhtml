    FSFE is hiring: project manager
  </h1>

  <p>We are looking for a project manager to support
  our work to empower people to control technology. The person will work
  35 hours per week with our team in the FSFE's Berlin office supporting
  FSFE projects and managing larger FSFE events. There will be
  coordination with remote staff and volunteers, as well as travels
  to other countries.</p>
  
  <h2 id="aboutthefsfe">About the FSFE</h2>

  <p>Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to
  control technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our
  lives; and it is important that this technology empowers rather than
  restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use,
  understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other
  fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.</p>

  <p>The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free
  Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination.
  It enhances users' rights by abolishing barriers to Free Software
  adoption, encourages people to use and develop Free Software, and
  provides resources to enable everyone to further promote Free Software
  in Europe.</p>

  <p>We are involved in legal, economic, political, and technical
  projects around Free Software (see <a
  href="/activities/activities.html">our work areas</a> and <a
  href="/activities/activities.html">our
  campaigns</a>).</p>

  <p>In the <a href="/activities/ln/ln.html">Legal
  network</a> we facilitate the discussion between legal and technical
  experts around Free Software legal and licensing questions. For this
  audience the FSFE also organises a yearly workshop for ~120 experts in
  this field.</p>

  <p>In our work we build upon our volunteers in cooperation with other
  organisations, companies, and public administrations.</p>

  identify as part of a traditionally marginalised demographic in
  technology for applications of equal strength.</p>
