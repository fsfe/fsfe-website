    <title>ACTA stakeholder consultation meeting, Brussels, BE</title>
    <body>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement">ACTA</a> is an international agreement on copyright and patents
      which several developed countries are currently negotiating
      in secret. While no official texts have been published,
      numerous leaked documents indicate that the treaty would
      further restrict our freedom to share and re-use knowledge.
      The European Commission's DG TRADE is holding a
      stakeholders' consultation meeting to inform Europeans about
      the state of play of the negotiations. FSFE's President
      Karsten Gerloff will attend the meeting and represent the
      interests of Free Software. 
      
      The event is open to the public, but registration is
      required. The European Commission promises
      to make a web stream of the event available.
