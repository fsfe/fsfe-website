<h3>Abstract</h3>
	  
	<p><em> As lawmakers are grappling with the multitude of changes brought about by technology and the Internet, they often face pressure to restrict the potential of the Internet in the name of security. Digital activists are attacking censorship, building distributed networks, and writing software that enables them to be in full control of their own computers.</em></p>
	<p><em>How can we use Free Software to build strong democratic institutions <br /> How can we get better at sharing knowledge for progress? <br /> Are citizens naked and alone in the age of "cloud computing"?<br /> What rules do we need to secure freedom in the digital society?</em></p>
