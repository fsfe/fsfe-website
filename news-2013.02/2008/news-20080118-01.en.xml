		<title>NLnet continues to support FSFE's Freedom Task Force</title>
    <body>
FSFE's Freedom Task Force was launched in November 2006 to help support
individuals, projects and businesses with Free Software licensing. The
initial phase of the FTF was possible thanks to support by the
Netherlands based philantropic organisation NLnet foundation. NLnet's
support allowed the FTF to provide training, consultancy and to work in
partnership with gpl-violations.org to resolve licence issues in the
European area.  The FTF also formed networks of technical and legal
experts to foster cooperation between lawyers, projects and businesses
with licensing concerns.  Now, after just over twelve months of
continual growth, NLnet is providing a second round of financial support
to this innovative legal project.
