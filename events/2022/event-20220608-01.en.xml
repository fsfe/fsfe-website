        <title>'Artificiall Intelligence and Free Software in the European Union' talk (online)</title>

    <body>
      
      <p>The EU is on its way to adopting legislation on artificial intelligence. Transparency plays a major role in this. But how exactly should this transparency be designed and what role does Free Software play? Alexander Sander will give an insight into the current state of the debate and what chances there are that provisions for Free Software will be included in the legislation. The talk takes place at 11:55 and it is part of the OW2 2022 conference. It is in English, there is no need to register, and it is free of charge.<br />
