Re 7. Reports of Extended Executive Committee
---------------------------------------------

The vice-president, Jonas Öberg, felt no need to add anything to the
information given by the Executive Committee.

The Head of Office refers to his talk on the current financial
situation and estimations on the future, given earlier the day and
also attended by all members.  Due to increased donations, which are partly
due to compensation payments caused by GPL violations, and the launch
of the fellowship the financial situation is solid.  The Hub and the
Chapter Germany gain a plus of 1000 Euro/month. He proposes to use
this money and the additional - not yet determined - revenues to be
gained by the Chapter Italy to further the operation of the office.  In
particular, he suggests to to rent an office close to the living place
of him (Düsseldorf) and to engage a part time person to run the
office.

The plans are discussed. It was requested to setup a policy to employ
