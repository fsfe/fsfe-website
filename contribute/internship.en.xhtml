<p>
  Before starting with the details, a few words from former FSFE interns:
</p>

<blockquote>
  FSFE is involved in the most important processes on how Information Society
  is being shaped, be it on a national, European, or on a global level. It's
  exciting to be part of these activities.  (Alexander Finkenberger)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  If you've followed my <a
  href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/gerloff/">blog</a>, you will have an
  idea of what I did with my time. The FSFE is a great place to work, and I've
  enjoyed almost every single day. In few other companies or organisations
  would I have had the chance to do useful work and learn in an international
  context like I did here. Take this chance, if you can.  (Karsten
  Gerloff)
