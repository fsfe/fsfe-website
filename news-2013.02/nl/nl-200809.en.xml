      This was an important month for Free Software.  Not only was Software Freedom
      Day held (as always) on the 20th, but this years marks the 25th anniversary of
      the GNU Project.  Celebrations took place across Europe and our Fellows
      continued to support Free Software in local areas with enthusiasm and passion.
