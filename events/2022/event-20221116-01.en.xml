        <title>FSFE the Netherlands get-together (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>The FSFE Netherlands country team meets every month and discusses the latest news related to Free Software. Current hot topics are the Router Freedom in Belgium and an initiative to promote Free Software in Education.</p>
      <p>The meeting will be from 20:00 until 22:00 CET on the conference server. It is usually quite 'gezellig' and so most stay until 23:00, but you can leave whenever you see fit. The meeting is open for everybody, and we'll switch to English if not everybody understands Dutch. More information can be found on the wiki. At the meetings we abide by the FSFE Code of Conduct. To join the meeting please send an email to country coordinator Nico Rikken (nico[dot]rikken[at]fsfe[dot]org), he will send you the meeting link and access code.</p>
