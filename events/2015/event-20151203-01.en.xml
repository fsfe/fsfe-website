      <p>
     Jonas Ã–berg, FSFE's executive director, will give the keynote at
     FOSSCon Korea, talking about how massive collaboration between
     individuals and business have shaped the free software
     environment in recent years, and how this explosion of activity,
     properly nurished and given the right scaffolding, is an
     opportunity to shape the standards for free software in the future.
     FOSSCon Korea is organised by the Korean National IT Industry
     Promotion Agency.
