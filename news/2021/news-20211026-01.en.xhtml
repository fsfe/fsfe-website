<h1 id="software-freedom-in-europe-2021">Software Freedom in Europe 2021</h1>

  <p>
	  &quot;Software Freedom in Europe&quot; is the yearly report of 
	  the Free Software Foundation Europe e.V. (FSFE). This report 
	  corresponds to our work during November 2020 - October 2021.
  </p>
      
  <p>
	Cancelling of large events, limitations in meetings, and travel 
	restrictions: <strong>none of this stopped the FSFE from advancing Software 
	Freedom</strong> in 2021. From giving online 'Public Money? Public Code!' 
	workshops to volunteers, to organising an online Legal and 
	Licensing Workshop for legal experts, we kept empowering the Free 
	Software community. The FSFE assisted software projects to become REUSE 
	compliant with our new initiative, REUSE Booster.
  </p>

  <p>
	We created an interactive map to demonstrate the developments of 
	Router Freedom rights in Europe. The FSFE presented suggestions 
	and demands to support sustainable software. Meanwhile, a two-year 
	court case initiated by FSFE supporter Luca Bonissi successfully 
	came to an end, unequivocally recognising the right to a Windows 
	licence refund. Overall, significant accomplishments for Software 
	Freedom marked 2021, the year <strong>FSFE is celebrating its 20th 
	anniversary</strong>.

  <p>
	While the yearly report corresponds to our work during November 
	2020 - October 2021, many of our activities last for many years. We 
	are celebrating our 20-years milestone because ultimately 
	<strong>it is our long term presense that allows us to advance 
	Software Freedom</strong>. Initiatives become more robust every 
	year, as we have seen with the growing adoption of Public Money 
	Public Code and REUSE.
  </p>
  <p>
	Likewise, informing the public about the benefits of Free Software 
	is a core activity that builds up over time. We inform people in 
	information booths, we run workshops and give talks, we send out a 
	montly Newsletter and publish a podcast episode every two months to 
	help the Free Software community grow and stay connected. Still, 
	sometimes our endeavors succeed after an entire journey which 
	brings us in parliaments or to courts, like the <a 
	href="/activities/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.html">Microsoft vs EU case</a> 
	did. This is why <strong> continuous engagement for Software 
	Freedom matters </strong>.

 <h3 id="20-years-fsfe">Celebrating 20 Years FSFE</h3>

  <p>
	   Long before the first smartphone was introduced, it was evident 
	   to the FSFE's founders that it is the people who should be in 
	   control of technology. In 2001, Free Software 
	   experts around Europe therefore created the Free Software 
	   Foundation Europe e.V. In 2021, the <strong> <a href="/about/">Free Software Foundation Europe</a>  
	   turns 20</strong>. This means two decades of empowering users to control 
	   technology. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt, and share software, This way, Free Software contributes to freedom, 
       transparency, and self-determination.

  <p>
	  The FSFE was founded in <a 
	  href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2001q2/000003.html">April 
	  2001</a>, so in April 2021 we started having a look <a 
	  href="/activities/20years/20years.html">at our community and 
	  previous work</a>. We contacted people who paved the way of the 
	  FSFE since its beginning, such as long term volunteers and past 
	  staffers. We have interviewed <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210204-01.html">Georg Greve</a>, <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210625-01.html">Torsten Grote</a>, <a

	  href="/news/2021/news-20210420-01.html">and Fernanda Weiden</a>, 
	  and we received a video message from Cory <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210529-01.html">Doctorow</a>. We shared 
	  the FSFE <a 
	  href="/activities/20years/20years.html#Highlights-from-the-last-20-years">highlights 
	  from the last 20 years</a>, and Matthias Kirschner, President of 
	  the FSFE since 2015, <a 
	  href="https://peertube.social/videos/watch/1fd019fd-2fcf-4777-8b3a-59ac647ab542">presented</a> 
	  the work of the organisation since its founding. To mark this 
	  important milestone, we <a href="/order/">produced</a> a bag and 
	  a sticker.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	Although technology is ever-changing, our values have been 
	consistent throughout the last twenty years. The core of our work 
	is, in a nutshell: educating people on the nature of Free Software, 
	highlighting its sociopolitical implications, and simplifying its legal 
	preconditions. Therefore, we divide our work into three areas: Policy 
	Advocacy, Legal Support, and Public Awareness. Matthias Kirschner 
	explains this in his own words in 
	a short video:

<h2 id="policy">Policy advocacy</h2>

  <h3 id="pmpc">1. Raising 'Public Money? Public Code!' demand</h3>
  
  <p>
	Why is software created using taxpayers’ money not released as Free 
	Software? The 'Public Money? Public Code' initiative was launched 
	in 2018. Its popularity demonstrates that our continuous effort 
	through the years can make a difference. 207 organisations and 
	administrations support our call for action by signing our <a 
	href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">open letter</a>. Good news 
	of certain municipalities embracing Free Software keep coming in. 
	In 2021, PMPC progressed in a variety of sectors, ranging from EU 
	policy to public health related apps.
  </p>
   
  <h3 id="eu-open-source-strategy">Examining the EU Open Source Strategy</h3>

  <p>
	The FSFE <a href="/news/2020/news-20201023-01.html">examined</a> 
	the new Open Source Strategy of the EU for the period 2020-2023 and 
	raised its concerns. The benefits of Free Software are fully 
	emphasised and the Commission is on paper ambitious in its future 
	use of Free Software. However, concrete goals are rare and a clear 
	commitment to the use of Free Software is lacking. The strategy 
	mainly repeats previous commitments and activities; sustainable and 
	verifiable approaches are sought in vain.
  </p>

  <p>
	  In February 2021, we <a 
	  href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/ecoss/">interviewed</a> 
	  Evangelos Tsavalopoulos, Head of sector of the European Commission Open Source Software Unit, and addressed the most important 
	  questions about this strategy.
  </p>
  
<h3 id="pmpc-workshops">Offering PMPC Workshops</h3>

  <p>
	  In the framework of its campaign &quot;Public Money? Public 
	  Code!&quot;, the FSFE has launched a workshop series, <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/ContactingAdministrationsForPMPC">Contact 
	  your administrations</a>. Its target audience is volunteers and 
	  supporters from all over Europe who want to become active in 
	  reaching out to their local representatives. This workshop aims 
	  to share best practices when addressing public administrations to 
	  discuss Free Software in the public sector, while empowering 
	  volunteers to become more active within their own communities. 
	  During 2021, Lina Ceballos, an FSFE Project Manager, and 
	  Alexander Sander, Policy Consultant of the FSFE, held online 
	  sessions of this workshop for our Italian and Spanish 
	  communities. Bonnie Mehring held the online session for this 
	  workshop in German.
  </p>
    
  
<h3 id="code-repository-public-sector">Conceptualising a code repository for the public sector</h3>

  <p>
	  Together with our associated organisation the 'Open Source 
	  Business Alliance', the federal working group of municipal IT 
	  service providers and other experts, FSFE has developed a first 
	  concept for a code repository for the public sector. In the proposal, we 
	  clarified the potential of Free Software (<a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20200910-01.html">EN</a>, <a 
	  href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/papers/20200910-Ein-Ort-fuer-oeffentlichen-Code.v1.pdf">DE, .pdf</a>) 
	  for use in public institutions and how such a repository can 
	  contribute to the further development of the digitalisation of 
	  administrations. This concept is already being tested with a 
	  pilot project in the German states of <a 
	  href="/news/nl/nl-202103.html#what-have-we-done-inside-and-outside-the-fsfe">North Rhine-Westphalia and 
	  Baden-Württemberg in cooperation with the Ministry of Interior</a>.

	<figcaption>The FSFE conceptualised a code repository for the public sector. It is being tested in a pilot project.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
<h3 id="public-health-apps">Demanding Free Software in Public Health related apps</h3>

  <p>
	  Amid the difficulties of the pandemic, the FSFE identifies a 
	  crucial aspect: that apps related to public health should be Free 
	  Software. This way they will be transparent, trustworthy, and 
	  available to people who consciously avoid proprietary software. 
	  Throughout this challenge <a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20200402-02.html">our demands focus on user 
	  rights</a>, and this is reflected in our work. In December of 
	  2020, the FSFE stood in favour of coronavirus tracing apps to be 
	  Free Software and thanked the volunteers who <a 
	  href="https://codeberg.org/corona-contact-tracing-germany/cwa-android">liberated</a> 
	  the German Corona Warn app (CWA). The FSFE <a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20201208-01.html">appealed</a> to 
	  governments and administrations to publish developed software as 
	  Free Software, to break dependencies on proprietary app stores 
	  and instead make their apps installable from independent sources 
	  like F-Droid, and to renounce proprietary dependencies. This also 
	  helps to protect fundamental rights such as the right to privacy.
	</p>

	<figcaption>Example of Corona Tracing app</figcaption>
  </figure>
	 
	<p>
	  In August 2021, we witnessed the same 
	  problematic pattern in Germany: volunteers once more had to step 
	  in to take over the government&#39;s task in order to make the 
	  CovPass app available to everyone. The FSFE <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210830-01.html">urges</a> 
	  the government to quickly adapt its practices and make sure 
	  everyone can use such apps without any restrictions from the 
	  start. Furthermore, if it is ensured that solutions are published as 
	  Free Software, they can be adjusted and reused by other 
	  institutions around the world.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="participation-apps">Demanding accessibility to political participation apps</h3> 

  <p>
	In the Netherlands, the official application for parliamentary debates is not 
	available under a Free Software license.  
	 In 2018, FSFE supporter Jos van den Oever noticed that the 'Debat Direct' app 
	could not be downloaded to his Firefox OS phone. Jos' request to get the 
	app's source code was denied, and he brought the case to court. The 
	Council of State ruled on 31 March 2021 that the Parliament does 
	not have to publish the source code. The FSFE therefore <a href="/news/2021/news-20210611-01.html">calls 
	upon the Dutch Parliament</a> to impose rules on itself, to act 
	transparently, and to publish the source code of such applications 
	under a Free Software licence in the future.
  </p>

    <figcaption>The FSFE calls upon the Dutch Parliament to publish the source code of political participation apps.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  	
  <p>	
	 Moreover, the FSFE calls on the Dutch government to <a 
	 href="/news/2021/news-20210521-01.html">stand firm and get a grip 
	 on their digital security and autonomy by adhering to Open 
	 Standards and Free Software</a>, in line with their earlier 
	 commitment to use Free Software by default. The Netherlands is 
	 becoming dependent on a digital infrastructure that is dominated 
	 by a small number of monopolistic companies. Although the Dutch 
	 Cyber Security Council recognises the consequent risk, their 
	 report neglects focusing on Open Standards and Free Software, the 
	 proven best practices to face this problem. 
  </p>
  
<h3 id="spreading-the-word">Spreading the word</h3>

  <p>
	  In 2021 we translated our &#39;Public Money? Public Code!&#39; 
	  video into <a href="https://publiccode.eu/sv/#about">Swedish</a> and
	  <a href="https://publiccode.eu/nl/#about">Dutch</a>.
	  Apart from those translations, the PMPC video is available in 
	  English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and 
	  Slovenian. We also translated the PMPC brochure in Spanish.
  </p>
  
<h3 id="local-governments">Bringing Free Software to local governments</h3>

  <p>
	On May 2021, we contributed to a report on the use of Free Software 
	in <a 
	href="https://www.kgst.de/documents/20181/34177/KGSt-Bericht-5-2021_Open-Source.pdf/994d10d0-ec25-f8ed-91af-1a12518c27d3">local

    <figcaption>Dortmund embraces Free Software</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p>	
	With an overwhelming 
	cross-faction majority, <a href="/news/2021/news-20210331-01.html">Dortmund</a> committed itself to the use of 
	Free Software in a groundbreaking <a 
	href="/news/2021/news-20210331-01.html">resolution</a> 
	(DE) in February 2021. The case of Dortmund, where the motion 
	passed unanimously, proves that all sides can appreciate the 
	practical benefits of Free Software. The result was made possible 
	by the consistent efforts of the DO-FOSS initiative, which also 
	supported the &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; campaign of the 
	FSFE. The Council&#39;s decision means that there is now 
	political backing to gradually break down dependencies on 
	proprietary vendors. The FSFE will follow the implementation and 
	at the same time call on other administrations in Germany and 
	Europe to follow Dortmund&#39;s example.
  </p>	
  
  <p>	
	The Swiss cantons of <a 
	href="/news/2021/news-20210318-01.html">Bern and Uri</a> 
	embraced Free Software and the FSFE met online with the people 
	behind this process. Bern followed the steps of another Swiss 
	canton, Uri, trailbrazer for the use of Free Software in 
	administration. For years, the Free Software app &#39;Caluma&#39; has 
	been successful in Switzerland. The example of the cantons of Uri 
	and Bern shows that the principle of &quot;Public Money? Public 
	Code!&quot; benefits everyone: citizens, the administration, and 
	also the economy.
   </p>
   
   <h3 id="sustainability">2. Discovering the sustainability of Free Software</h3>

  <p>
	 We recently published a study <a 
	 href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">&#39;On the 
	 Sustainability of Free Software&#39;</a> that includes five core demands about <a 
	 href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html#what-can-politics-and-society-do-for-a-more-sustainable-digitization">What 
	 can politics and society do for a more sustainable

  <ul>
    <li>
		When the software of a device is not supported any more, the 
		manufacturers should publish the source code of the software 
		under a Free Software license.
    </li>
    <li>
		Users must be given the right to install the operating system

<h3 id="router-freedom">3. Supporting Router Freedom in the EU</h3>

  <p>
	  Since 2013 the FSFE has been a leading voice in promoting 
	  end-users&#39; right to use their own personal modems and 
	  routers. Router Freedom is not a one-time achievement. As the 
	  regulations change, our work is continuous to defend this digital 
	  right. Our long-term engagement for Software Freedom is needed, 
	  and it makes a difference.
  </p>
  <p>	  
	  2021 represented a milestone for the implementation of Router 
	  Freedom in Europe. We exerted great efforts to protect Router

	  This year demonstrated that although the regulatory framework 
	  remains fragmented in the EU, Router Freedom is emerging as a 
	  prospective reality. We empowered people to defend their right to 
	  use their own internet equipment all over Europe.

<h3 id="rf-informing">Informing and empowering the public</h3>

  <p>
	  In response to the EU reform of telecommunications law (EECC), we 
	  explained that <a href="/news/2020/news-20200601-01.html">Router 
	  Freedom is fundamental for security and privacy</a> and 
	  summarized the current status in an <a 
	  href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-router-freedom-activity-summary.pdf">Activity 
	  Summary</a>. Router Freedom is essential for fair competition in 
	  markets and sustainability by promoting compatibility among 
	  devices and the right to repair.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	  In March 2021, when EU countries started to implement the telecom 
	  reform, we launched an <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210330-01.html">Engagement Package</a> so 
	  that anyone can organize supporting activities for Router 
	  Freedom. The included <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters/">wiki 
	  page</a> helps the volunteers of the initiative identify 
	  interested people, collect information, and set up courses of 
	  action. To involve the maximum number of people, we promoted 
	  Router Freedom in several events, gave talks, and organised expert 
	  meetings with stakeholders all over Europe. Our demands have been 
	  shared by several groups in public consultations and official 
	  hearings.

    <figcaption>Router Freedom is emerging as a reality in the EU.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p>
	  We followed closely the positive developments in the <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210805-01.html">Netherlands</a>, 
	  which confirmed our demands for consumer rights. In June 2021, we 
	  talked with a representative of the <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210629-01.html">Finnish 
	  regulator</a>, who explained why Router Freedom is essential for 
	  net neutrality. Our coordinated activities in <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210505-01.html">Greece</a> 
	  in May 2021 supported that regulator&#39;s preliminary decision to 
	  secure Router freedom. We worked closely with consumer 
	  organisations, digital groups, and business representatives to promote and leverage the 
	  agenda, demanding clear rules for consumers, as in the beginning 
	  of the legislative process in <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210506-01.html">Austria</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
	On another hand, we have monitored issues with implementations 
	which could harm Router Freedom. We raised our concerns when <a 
	href="/news/2021/news-20210505-01.html">Germany</a> 
	decided to step back from the positive experience the country has 
	built since 2016 by allowing the national regulator to determine a 
	regulatory framework against consumers. <a href="/news/2021/news-20211027-01.html">Latvia</a> opened an extremely dangerous precedent by 
	allowing ISPs to determine by themselves technological issues to 
	prohibit the use of personal routers.
  </p>
  
<h3 id="collecting-data">Collecting Data</h3>
  
  <p>
	  Router Freedom is undergoing a rapid development in Europe, so we 
	  created a <a 
	  href="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/router-freedom-tracker_581123#4/53.12/18.37">monitoring

	To understand better the issues end-users are facing with ISPs&#39;

<h3 id="international-development-cooperation">4. Promoting Free Software in international development cooperation</h3>

  <p>
	  In December 2020, the FSFE published an <a 
	  href="/freesoftware/developmentcooperation/index.html">analysis</a> 
	  of the benefits of using Free Software in international 
	  development cooperation. In this increasingly digitised sector, 
	  Free Software is becoming an indispensable fundamental technology 
	  that guarantees legally compliant international cooperation and 
	  reuse. With Free Software, global scaling is possible, as well as 
	  local adaptability. New monopolies and dependencies are avoided, 
	  which is a major UN sustainability goal.

<h3 id="radio-lockdown">5. Preventing a Radio Lockdown</h3>
  
  <p>
	  Since 2015, we have been monitoring the possible unpleasant 
	  effects of the European Radio Equipment Directive, for which we coined the term 
	  <a href="/activities/radiodirective/">Radio Lockdown</a>. 
	  Although the FSFE has warned the European Commission multiple 
	  times of the disastrous consequences Article 3(3)(i) can have for 
	  users, organisations, and the whole communication equipment 
	  market, the regulators did not give in. However, in the past 12 
	  months the Commission did not propose any concrete draft 
	  regulations, so we are in limbo. The FSFE will continue to 
	  monitor the situation closely.
  </p>
  
<h3 id="german-warning-system">6. Suggesting improvements to the German warning system</h3>

  <p>
    Already in November 2020, the FSFE flagged that <a 
	href="/news/2020/news-20201112-01.html">Germany's warning system is 
	unstable and ineffective</a> and pointed out pragmatic improvements 
	that can guarantee that a warning message can reach every person 
	needed while respecting software freedom and privacy. 
	Unfortunately, our suggestions were not implemented in time: 
	the German warning system once again failed in July 2021 during a 
	number of heavy regional floodings, after which the FSFE <a 
	href="https://www.thelocal.de/20210730/germany-knew-its-disaster-warning-system-wasnt-good-enough-why-wasnt-it-improved-2/">repeated</a> 
	that the more effective alternatives must be adopted as soon as 
	possible to prepare for the next serious events. The commentary 
	received several republications. 
	Since this wake-up call, it seems the responsible administrations 
	have been giving this crucial change the necessary attention and 
	traction.

<h3 id="reuse-booster">1. Launching REUSE Booster</h3>

  <p>
	 REUSE has facilitated the licensing of Free Software projects. 
	 Developers are given standardised ways to mark all files in a 
	 project with their chosen license and copyright notice. A 
	 tutorial, a set of FAQs, a helper tool, and an API have been made 
	 available to lower the threshold and save time.
  </p>

  </figure>
  
  <p>
	With <a href="https://reuse.software/booster/">REUSE Booster</a>, 
	the FSFE takes this initiative one step further. This progress was 
	possible thanks to the support the FSFE has received, which enables 
	the implementation of long-term activities. In 2021, the FSFE 
	launched REUSE Booster so that Free Software projects can seek 
	tailored support by legal experts. As the name suggests, this will 
	boost the process of adopting the best practices as well as general 
	understanding of licensing and copyright. Each project is evaluated 
	individually and the recommendations apply to its particular 
	situation.
  </p>

  <p>
	  Max Mehl joined a <a 
	  href="/news/podcast/episode-11.html">podcast</a> episode to 
	  present REUSE Booster and talk about the recent developments of 
	  the whole initiative. For example, REUSE was adopted by the KDE 
	  community as the standard best practice to communicate all 
	  projects' licensing and copyright situation. To learn how a large 
	  community like KDE managed this step, we interviewed <a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20201215-01.html">Andreas 
	  Cord-Landwehr</a>, long-term developer at KDE, to discuss this 
	  implementation.

<h3 id="llw">3. Organising the Legal and Licensing Workshop 2021</h3>

  <p>
	  In 2021, we organised and supported the very first online edition of the

	  Licensing Workshop</a>. The FSFE&#39;s Free Software Legal 
	  and Licensing Workshop (LLW) has been held annually for the <a 
	  href="/activities/ln/llw.html">FSFE&#39;s Legal Network</a> 
	  since 2008, and serves as a conference for <a 
	  href="/activities/ln/ln.html">legal experts</a> in the field 
	  of Free Software to debate over issues and share best practices 
	  surrounding Free Software licenses. Instead of a physical one-time 
	  conference, this year, from March to July, LLW offered online 
	  presentations, discussion panels, and workshops continuously.

	   in the US Supreme Court to legal considerations of Open 
	   Hardware. The LLW provided workshops on improving the quality of 
	   Free Software licensing information, including those specific to 
	   copyleft licenses. As with all online discussions of the Legal 
	   Network and its associated events, the <a 
	   href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule">Chatham 
	   House Rule</a> applied to this year&#39;s edition of the LLW.

    <h3 id="assistance-ngi0">Supporting Free Software Developers Through NGI0</h3>

  <p>
	  The FSFE  provided guidance on how to communicate the components, 
	  licences, and copyrights associated with software packages. We 
	  assisted software projects with their legal and licensing needs, 
	  and convinced them to adopt our REUSE standards as best practices 
	  for displaying licensing and copyright information.
  </p>

  <p>
	 We have guided over 100 NGI0 software projects to implement the 
	 REUSE standards on their workflow. This has included working 
	 directly with their repositories to better improve how the 
	 licensing and copyright information contained in their 
	 repositories is displayed, so that any adopters of their work in 
	 the future can more easily comply with these licence and 
	 copyright obligations.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
	<p>
	  "Regarding REUSE, we have learnt a lot. We realise that the 
	  idea behind REUSE is simple, clear, and powerful. Nowadays, 
	  Free Software projects become more and more complicated, and 
	  many components/files of a single project have different 
	  license/copyright information. REUSE helps a lot on tracking 
	  the status of this information in our project.”

<h3 id="zurich-award">Educational activity by Local Group Zurich receives award</h3>

  <p>
	  On December 2020, our Local Group Zurich members <a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20201211-01.html">received 
	  a DINAcon award</a> and we interviewed them. The local FSFE group 
	  in Zurich created a website called &quot;<a 
	  href="https://lernenwiedieprofis.ch">Learning like a 
	  pro</a>&quot; (original German: &quot;Lernen wie die 
	  Profis&quot;) which they use to explain why Free Software matters 
	  in education. It proceeds describing individual Free Software 
	  solutions and how these solutions in particular can be used to 
	  make school learning efficient and easy.

<h3 id="fsfe-women">FSFE Women group formed in 2021</h3>

  <p>
	  In 2021, the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Women">FSFE 
	  Women</a> group was created to help women and everyone who 
	  identifies as female build connections with each other while 
	  discussing technological issues. Starting out as a  
          German-speaking group, the FSFE Women turned to English in 
	  May to welcome new members from around Europe. FSFE Women meets 
	  every month online and covers aspects related to Free Software. In 
	  June 2021, Irmhild Rogalla gave a talk about the accessibility of 
	  video conferencing tools, supporting a conferencing platform for 
	  all. In July 2021, Bonnie Mehring presented PMPC in relation to 
	  the German elections. In August 2021, Loria presented how maps 
	  are created in a 2D workadventu.re world. The <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Women">FSFE Women</a> is open 
	  to everyone who identifies as female; it gladly welcomes new 
	  members.

<h3 id="syshackers">There is nothing that System Hackers cannot fix</h3>

  <p>
	The fact that you can read this report is also thanks to a few 
	volunteers we call the System Hackers. <a 
	href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/System-Hackers">This group</a> is 
	responsible for the development and maintenance of the FSFE's 
	technical infrastructure: servers, connectivity, virtual machines, 
	DNS, services, backups; a hundred of things can break in between, 
	but they keep it running. In 2021, there have too many exciting 
	changes to list them here, which is why we will write a piece about 
	their activities within the next weeks.
  </p>

<h3 id="translators">Translators remove language barriers</h3>

  <p>
	  The FSFE Translators team <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20211011-01.html">removes language 
	  barriers</a> for Software Freedom. During the past year the team 
	  has worked tirelessly on creating new translations and improving 
	  old ones. Since November 2020, the translators team has created 
	  376 new translations. Most of them are in Italian (189), followed 
	  by Dutch with 79 new translations. The translators team has also 
	  worked on improving the translation processes. 
  </p>

<h3 id="staffers">Staffers run day-to-day activities of the FSFE</h3>

  <p> 
	  Besides its dedicated volunteers, the FSFE also relies on its 
	  employees for its daily operations. At the FSFE we currently 
	  employ 7 full-time staffers, 5 part-time employees, and 1 intern. 
  </p>

  <p>
	In 2021 we welcomed <strong>6 new members to our 
	workforce</strong>. Since November 2020, Linda Wagener completes 
	bookkeeping and accounting tasks, offering a helping hand when 
	needed. Lina Ceballos successfully completed her internship in the FSFE last year, 
	and she has now joined our permanent 
	team. Lina is a Project Manager focusing on PMPC, REUSE, and Router 
	Freedom. Also, she helps the FSFE to reach our Spanish-language audience.
  </p>
  <p>	
	Linus Sehn is our new System Administrator; he makes sure our 
	systems run smoothly and solves any problems that come up. Since 
	May 2021, Fani Partsafyllidou has been our new Project Manager and 
	Newsletter Editor, supporting the implementation of Youth Hacking 4 
	Freedom, 20 Years FSFE, and Upcycling Android. Fani makes sure that 
	the work of the FSFE is accurately communicated to our community. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In September 2021, Marlene Kietreiber joined our team and brings 
	the magic of graphic design to the FSFE. At the same time, 
	Niharika Singhal joined our Legal team as an intern. Would you like to join our team? We are always interested in <a 
	href="/about/jobs/internship.html">internship applications</a>.
  </p>

<h3 id="ga">The General Assembly guides the progress of the FSFE</h3>

  <p>
	<strong>The FSFE is governed by its formal members</strong>, the <a 
	href="/about/team.html#general-assembly">&quot;General 
	Assembly&quot;</a>, who are responsible for planning, budgeting, 
	and setting the agenda, as well as electing the Executive Council 
	which currently consists of the FSFE&#39;s President Matthias 
	Kirschner, Vice-President Heiki Löhmus, and Financial Officer 
	Patrick Ohnewein.
  </p>

  <p>
	The FSFE complies with the guidelines set out in <a 
	href="https://www.transparency.de/Initiative-Transparente-Zivilg.1612.0.html">“transparent 
	civil society” by Transparency International Germany</a> with <a 
	href="/about/transparency-commitment.html">our transparency 
	commitment</a>. Besides our constitution and minutes from our 
	general assemblies, you will find information in our general 
	reports, name and functions of decision makers and staff, our 
	connections with other organisations, <a 
	href="/about/funds/funds.html">how we use our money</a>, and <a 
	href="/donate/thankgnus.html">who our donors are</a>.
  </p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward to 2022</h2>

  <p>
	In 2022, the FSFE will continue its activities while undertaking 
	new ones. The following paragraphs are not an exhaustive account of 
	our future activities, but a glimpse of what is coming up.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	In 2022 we are going to monitor the implementation of our PMPC 
	demands, protect Router Freedom in countries where the respective 
	legislation is coming up, and advocate to prevent a Radio Lockdown. 
	We plan to have a physical Legal and Licensing Workshop 2022 in 
	Gothenburg, Sweden, and will continuously evaluate the current 
	conditions there to ensure the safety of all participants. We are 
	currently preparing the implementation of two exciting projects for 
	the next year, Youth Hacking 4 Freedom and Upcycling Android.
  </p>
    
  <p>
	 Youth Hacking 4 Freedom is a coding competition to inspire young 
	 people to Software Freedom. It is open to teenagers 14-18 
	 from around Europe. Participants will compete in Youth Hacking for 
	 Freedom by creating programs of their choice licensed as Free 
	 Software. This hacking competition is a great opportunity for 
	 young people to receive inspiration and to network with important 
	 people of the field. For the winners, the cash prize might turn 
	 into an investment for their own project. 
  </p>

  <p>	
	Upcycling Android will be a campaign with a web presence and 
	practical workshops to overcome software obsolescence on Android by 
	installing Free Software. It will aim to achieve users' freedom and 
	care for the environment at the same time. 
  </p>
     
  <p>
     Overall, the next year 
	of the FSFE is exciting and promising as we plan to reach out to a 
	younger audience and to highlight the importance of software 
	sustainability. If you are interested in following our future projects 
	make sure you <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/newsletter-en">subscribe</a> to our Newsletter.
  </p>
  
<h2 id="join">Join our movement</h2>

  <p>
	  In the last few years, we exceeded ten thousand people from 
	  Europe and beyond who are supporting our cause by <a 
	  href="/contribute/spreadtheword">spreading our word</a>, signing 
	  our open letters, subscribing to our <a 
	  href="/contact/email-updates.html">community mails</a> and <a 
	  href="/news/newsletter.html">newsletter</a>, or joining our <a 
	  href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/discussion">public 
	  discussions</a>. If you ever wondered who all these people are 
	  and what a FSFE supporter looks like, we have created a dedicated 
	  <a href="/about/people/testimonials">testimonials page</a> for 
	  you, where many of our supporters have left a quote, an 
	  interview, or a video.
  </p>

  <p>
	  <strong>The FSFE would be nothing without our contributors. And 
	  it would be so much more with you!</strong> If you feel inspired 
	  after reading our report, there are many ways to engage in our 
	  movement. We have a dedicated <a href="/contribute">contribution 
	  page</a> to help you find a way that best fits your interests and 
	  skills.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	One of the easiest entrance levels is to spread the word about Free 
	Software in public or among your friends with our <a 
	href="/contribute/spreadtheword">promotion material</a> or directly 
	show your love for Free Software by wearing <a 
	href="/order/index.html">some of our inspiring merchandise 
	items</a>. Follow and share our <a href="/events/events.html">event 
	announcements</a>, find an event that fits your interests, and then 
	go there to meet like-minded people. Don&#39;t be shy; most of us 
	have been in your position once.
  </p>

  <p>
	  If you find no event near you, you can also join us online. If 
	  you want to contribute with your <a 
	  href="/contribute/web/web.html">IT skills</a> or your <a 
	  href="/contribute/translators/translators.html">language 
	  skills</a>, you are more than welcome to join our respective 
	  online teams. Not yet sure where to start? Then look into <a 
	  href="https://community.fsfe.org/">our discourse-instance</a> and 
	  start to get to know our community and get inspired about what 
	  you can do.
  </p>

  <p>
	Finally, advocating for freedom also costs money and we depend on 
	people like you to <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/support">support us 
	financially</a>. All support is used to improve European software 
	freedom a little more each day, step by step, bit by bit.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="spreading-the-word">Spreading the word</h3>

  <p>
	  We offer gratis information packages, so that people can raise 
	  awareness about software freedom in their communities. From 1 
	  November 2020 until now we have sent 263 information packages. 
	  Thank you to all of you who spread the news and help us to reach 
	  more people about Free Software. The FSFE T-shirt collection is 
	  beloved; we have sold 700 T-shirts since 1 November 2020. Also, 
	  we introduced two new products to celebrate 20 Years of the FSFE: 
	  a bag, which you can see below, and a sticker.
