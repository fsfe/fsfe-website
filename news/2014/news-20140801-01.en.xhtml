        <h1>Your input needed for the FSFE's strategy
process</h1>
            <p newsteaser="yes"><br>Your ongoing support of our mission makes you an important part of
FSFE. As we are currently running a strategy process inside the FSFE
we would love to have your feedback about our work, about what you
like and maybe not like, and where we might improve.</br></p>

   			<p><br>For this, we have compiled a survey with open questions about our
work, and a brief part about your background. The background is being
asked, to have better picture about who you are and---since you are
FSFE---who FSFE is.</br></p>

				<p><br>All of the questions are voluntary and will only be used internally
for the purpose of our evaluation. You can fill out one, two or all of
them.  You can answer anonymously, but we encourage you to leave us a
email-address, so we can contact you if we have further questions
about your answers.</br></p>

<p><br>The survey is available <a href="https://vote.fsfe.org/index.php?sid=64934&amp;lang=en">here</a>.</br></p>
