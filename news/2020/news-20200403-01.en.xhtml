<h1>FSFE Supporters write about Free Software for remote working</h1>

<p>Due to the ongoing Covid-19 virus outbreak many employees - voluntarily or mandatory - are working remotely now. Many organisations who have not been used to remote working so far now face a number of difficulties adapting to the situation. To avoid potential lock-ins, some FSFE supporters collectively wrote about the good reasons to use Free Software for remote working and collected a detailed list of practical solutions <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/FreeSoftware4RemoteWorking">in our wiki</a>.</p> 

<p>Because of the ongoing Covid-19 virus outbreak many organisations who never previously directed any strategic thought towards the available solutions for remote working in their business now opt for a quick solution and choose to follow the - in the beginning often free of charge - offerings from big tech companies and their proprietary solutions. However, <a href="/news/2020/news-20200330-01.html">such proprietary solutions lock-in these organisations in the future</a>.</p> 

<p>Choosing a Free Software solution instead means to opt for a solution that has a future, where your organization no longer depends on a particular vendor or file format or whichever other means those vendors choose to lock you in. Free Software puts you in control. </p>

<p>To help you getting started or digging deeper into using Free Software for collaboratively and remote working some FSFE supporters worked on a detailed list of Free Software solutions for different purposes and <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/FreeSoftware4RemoteWorking">published the outcome in our wiki</a>. Find inspiration for your work environment or add your own solution.</p>
