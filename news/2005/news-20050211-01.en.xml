    <title>UN WGIG: Commented Papers Available</title>
    <body>
        On 1st February 2005, the United Nations Working Group on
        Internet Governance (WGIG) published a set of 20 issue papers
        concerning "Internet Governance." Together with its associate
        organisation La Fundación Vía Libre, the Free Software
        Foundation Europe managed to comment on the paper on "Cyber
        security, cybercrime", which, among other things, asked to
        outlaw the art of finding elegant solutions to non-obvious
        problems ("hacking") and the paper on "Intellectual Property
        Rights", which for instance asked to "balance human rights
        with the interests of rights-holders."
