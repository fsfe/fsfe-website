		<h2 id="fellowship">The Fellowship</h2>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>What is the Fellowship?</dt>
			<dd>The Fellowship is the primary way people can identify with and support the Free Software Foundation Europe. Fellows are FSFE's sustaining members that enable our financial autonomy and empower our work. Every Fellow is important to us, motivates us, supports us and gives us valuable feedback for our work. Although this is not a must, many Fellows decide to become part of our community, chat with other Fellows, blog about Free Software or even meet in local groups. Read more on the <a href="/fellowship/about/fellowship.html">about FSFE's Fellowship</a> page</dd>
			
			<dt>I am already a supporter - shall I become a Fellow?</dt>
			<dd>Decide on your own. Becoming or being a supporter of FSFE is a first step that we highly appreciate. By being a supporter of FSFE, you show that you care about users and software freedom and are interested in and appreciate the work of FSFE. It is also the first step into FSFE's community and a way to keep you up to date about our activities. However, in the long run, FSFE needs financial support to hire staff so we can realize more projects that we have in mind and have even more influence on politics. We are a non-profit organisation and you can be sure, that every Euro you spend to FSFE will be used responsibly.</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="donate"></a>I just would like to donate money to FSFE - how do I do that best?</dt>
			<dd>If you would like to spend money to the FSFE but you do not have interest in community activities, still the most efficient and best way is to join the Fellowship. This is because you keep our administrative overhead as low as possible if you donate by joining the Fellowship. During the registration process, you will be asked if you are looking for contact to local Fellowship groups. Just leave this box unchecked and we will not bother you with any community news. In Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, your Fellowship donation will be tax decuctible just as any usual donation or a single donation to us.</dd>
			
			<dt>How do I become a Fellow?</dt>
			<dd>to become a Fellow you have to join FSFE's Fellowship. To join the Fellowship you can easily <a href="/fellowship/ams/join.php?ams=join">fill out our online form</a>. You will then receive a mail with further instructions about payment methods and your registration process. Payment can be done monthly or yearly. As a last step, you pay whatever you have stated to contribute as your donation. That's it - welcome to the Fellowship!</dd>
			
			<dt>Besides being part of FSFE's community - do I get something?</dt>
			<dd>Yes. You get access to our system and can use our infrastructure. See inside the <a href="/fellowship/about/fellowship.en.html#youget">about page for an overview</a>. </dd>
			
			<dt>What if I can't afford the minimum Fellowship donation?</dt>
			<dd>If you fell not able to pay the Fellowship fee, you can apply for the Fellowhip grant. See our <a href="grant.html">Fellowship grant</a> page for more infomation.</dd>

		<h2 id="local-groups">Local Fellowship groups</h2>
		
		<dl>
			
			<dt>What is a Fellowship group?</dt>
			<dd>Fellowship groups are people that meet in real life in a certain area. These local meetings often consist of Fellows as well as non-Fellows. Fellowship groups undertake activities ranging from a comfortable beer to running a public awareness event, take part in a campaign or give and hear a talk during their meetings. One big point about these meetings is to get to know the people in your area that feel strong about software freedom and to interconnect each other. When you sign up for the Fellowship, you will be asked if you like to get in contact with a local group. If you do so, our Fellowship staff will get in contact with you and connect you with your local group - if there is one.</dd>
			
			<dt>Is a Fellowship meeting only for Fellows?</dt>
			<dd>Of course not. Fellowship meetings are public meetings and open for everyone interested in Free Software and the work of FSFE. In fact, it can be really interesting to gather people from different groups and to profit from synergy-effects.</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="isthereagroup"></a>Is there already a Fellowship Group in my area?</dt>
			<dd>A list of existing groups can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/CategoryFellowshipGroup">Fellowship Wiki</a>. If there is no existing group in your area, maybe you would like to start one?</dd>
			
			<dt>Can I start a new Fellowship group?</dt>
			<dd>Absolutely! See "<a href="new-group.en.xhtml">Starting a Fellowship Group</a>" for help and information about best practice of how to start a Fellowship group.</dd>
			
			
			<dt>How to name a local Fellowship group</dt>
			<dd>There is not one name for all Fellowship groups, rather Fellowship groups can decide about their name on their own. Most groups call themself "Fellowship group $Cityname", "FSFE Fellowship group $Cityname" or "FSFE local group $Cityname". Please do not name yourself "FSFE $Cityname" as there might be confusion between the legal association of FSFE and your local group of supporters.</dd>
