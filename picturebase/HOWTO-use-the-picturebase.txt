Welcome to the FSFE's picturebase

Please put all pictures in here using the following scheme:


# Quality
Pictures should be uploaded in the best quality and dimensions available. It is easy to downscale any picture but impossible to upscale dimensions. Consider to GIMP your pictures befor uploading to improve their visual appearance.


# 800-pixel-web-Version
Any picture you like to use embedded in fsfe.org should be downscaled to a width of 800 pixels with the same name as your picture but added a "-800px" in the end of the file name. This allows us to embedding this downscaled picture for faster page-loads of fsfe.org and in the same time immediately access the original picture if wanted. 
Example:
* /booths/201807-booth-at-rmll.jpg
* /booths/201807-booth-at-rmll-800px.jpg


# Filenames
Filename are a big help to get an info about a picture without the need to open it. All files should start with the year and most probably also with the month when the picture was taken. 
Example: 
* /events/201905-webathon-group-picture.jpg

In case of a graphic it should include the year the grapic was taken
Example:
* /activities/ilovefs/2019-ilovefs-artwork-Elektrollart.jpeg

depending on the folder the picture is archived in, the filenames also follow a certain scheme that is explained in the next section where the content of these folders is explained as well. 


# Topical Folders

we have topical folders inside the picturebase to help find pictures when in need. Please read through the following information to understand where to put your picture.

Sometimes pictures can be in two folder, for example a group-picture shot during a FSFE event qualifies for the /events/ folder as well as the /people/ folder. You have to chose one of the folders then, please do not put them in both!

As a general help to decide where to put them you should follow the approach to go from the most concrete topical folder to the broader one. More concrete are
- booths (booths only)
- campaigns (specific campaigns inside)
- events (only fsfe-events)
- fundraising (only fundraising relevant pictures here)
- onstage (only pictures of fsfe people giving talks, workshops etc)

More broader folders are:
- graphics
- miscellaneous 
- people (but only fsfe-people!)
all of which collect pictures that do not fit in the other categories.


## booths
