			The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) commemorates the
			anniversary of the software patents decision by the
			European Parliament on 24th September.  "The parliament
			voted for a restrictive way to grant software patents in
			Europe. That decision was wise as it accounted for the
			numerous recommendations of scientists throughout the
			world. For this reason, we would like to encourage the
			parliament to maintain an attitude to this matter that is
			consistent with its previous decision - to withstand the
			pressure by certain lobbying parties." the President of
			FSFE Georg Greve emphasises.
