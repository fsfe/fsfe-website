	<h2>The different ways to get involved and help FSFE:</h2>

	<dt>Join the Fellowship!</dt><dd>The Fellowship of FSFE is the primary way people can identify
	with and support our organisation. Fellows add visible support and contribution to all activities
	of the FSFE, they get in touch with other like-minded people, and become active both in local and
	in international events. Are you interested? <a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org/">Join the Fellowship today</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Discuss about Free Software</dt><dd> FSFE has Europe-wide, country-specific and
	activity-focused <a href="/contact/community.html">mailing lists</a>.

	experiences and opinions!

	</dd>

	<dt>Tranlsate our content into your own language</dt><dd> We try to distribute our documents,
	press releases, leaflets and web pages in as many languages as possible. In order to do so, we managed to built
	an excellent team of translators, where volunteers cooperate to translate and proofread this content into their
	own language. <a href="/contribute/translators/translators.html">Here</a> you find all the information you
	need to join the team and get started with some translations!
	</dd>

	<dt>Join our tradeshow booths!</dt><dd> FSFE participates in many European Free Software events
	during the whole year, and at these events we always try to have a booth where we talk about Free Software,
	our organisation and sell our merchandise. If you like participating at fairs, talking to people and
	explaining the philosophy of Free Software, then <a href="/contribute/booth/booth.html">read here</a>
	about booth activities and get in contact with the other volunteers.
