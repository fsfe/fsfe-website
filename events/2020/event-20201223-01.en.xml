        <title>FSFE Netherlands online get-together (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>On the 23th of December, at 20:00 (CET) o'clock, the FSFE Netherlands will have their localgroup meeting. Like last time it will be online, so that despite missing our regular physical meeting we keep in touch. The meeting starts at 20:00 until 21:00 (CET) o'clock on the conference server. It is usually quite 'gezellig' and so most of us stay until 22:30, but you can leave whenever you see fit. The meeting is open for everybody, and we'll switch to English if not everybody understands Dutch. To join the meeting please send an email to country coordinator Nico Rikken (nico[dot]rikken[at]fsfe[dot]org) and he will send you the meeting link and access code.</p>
