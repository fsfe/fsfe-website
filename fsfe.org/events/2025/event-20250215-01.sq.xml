      <p>Beyond celebrating I Love Free Software Day, we will also use this event as an opportunity to present our ongoing work for the Public Money, Public Code campaign. Our efforts are aimed at ensuring that publicly funded software is released as free software, benefiting citizens, businesses, and public administrations alike.<br />
With Albaniaâ€™s 2025 general elections approaching, LibreLabs is actively working to make digital sovereignty and transparency a key issue in the public discourse. Our campaign, detailed in our recent blog post, highlights why government-funded software should serve the public good, rather than being locked away under proprietary licenses.</p>
