    <body>
	Simon Josefsson is a Fellow and GNU hacker with a special interest in security. His contributions to the Free Software world include such ubiquitous projects as GnuTLS and Libssh2, and he was recently presented with the Nordic Free Software Award. I sat down for a jabber session with Simon, asking him about his projects and other security matters.
