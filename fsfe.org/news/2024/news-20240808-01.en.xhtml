<h1>European Commission needs to come up with dedicated budget for Free Software solutions</h1>

<p>After the recent news that funding for the Next Generation Internet 
initiative would be cut for the next phase of Horizon Europe, the 
European Commission has expressed vague support for Free Software. 
Unfortunately it is failing to provide concrete 
examples on how to do so. This has highlighted the fragility 
of funding for Software Freedom and the need for change in the 
long-term.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago,  <a href="/news/2024/news-20240719-01.html">we shared the news</a> that the European 
Commission has made the decision to stop funding the <a href="https://ngi.eu/">Next Generation 
Internet initiative (NGI)</a> in its then current draft for the Horizon 
Europe 2025 Work Programme. Since 2018, the European Commission has supported the Free 
Software ecosystem s through NGI, that provided funding and technical 
assistance to Free Software projects. The FSFE has always been a part 
of this initiative as a consortium member in the NGI Zero (NGI0) 
sub-group, where we provide legal and licensing support to hundreds of 
Free Software projects funded by the initiative.</p>

<h3>Update from the European Commission:  nice words but not long-term plan</h3> 

<div>
<p>The FSFE community has reached to the EU institutions and the Head 
of Unit of Next Generation Internet (DG CNECT), answered.  In this 
letter,  it is stated that the European Commission intends to support Free Software 
solutions, but it is not clear how and if there will be a budget for 
it:</p>

<blockquote>“The Commission will continue to support Open-Source 
solutions and the community supported in the NGI programme, in various 
initiatives notably to harness its potential to contribute to the 
transition of digital networks to a Connected and collaborative 
computing and the evolution towards Web 4.0. Both topics are present in 
the draft 2025 work programme to be approved by relevant Committee of 
Member States and Associated Countries.”</blockquote>

<p>While this is not a confirmation of renewed funding support for the 
NGI initiative, it does indicate a vague level of intent to continue 
supporting Software Freedom and Free Software development in the EU. 
Nevertheless, without any concrete programmes where this funding can 
go, and how it will be disbursed to grass-roots organizations that 
support Software Freedom, the future of financial support for Free 
Software in the EU remains sadly uncertain.</p>
</div>

<h3>Sustainable funding needed</h3>

<p>This development unfortunately exposes a larger issue: that software 
freedom in the EU needs more secure, long-term financial support. That 
this funding could so easily be left out of the Work Programme 
discussions demonstrates how precarious its position has been all 
along. Software Freedom needs to be consistently 
supported with public funds, and such support should not be easily 
displaced by decision-making that favours popular trends in 
technological development.</p>

<h3>Pressure helps – continue your efforts</h3>

<p>This statement from the European Commission is a sign that our 
persistence as well as from our community and various organizations 
about the lack of proposed funding for NGI’s future has  effect. 
Following the news of the proposed cut in funding last month, there was 
an outcry by us and from other Free Software organizations about <a 
href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/17/foss_funding_vanishes_from_eus/">how 
this would negatively impact Free Software development in the EU</a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, more work is definitely needed to continue to push for 
funding support for NGI and Free Software. This is why the FSFE is 
already in touch with various EU officials and 
decision-makers  to make sure this funding is secured for the future, 
and we call for you to do the same to keep the pressure on the EC high 
on this topic.</p> 

<h3>Reach the European Commission to ask for a sustainable funding</h3> 

<div> 
<p>The reply from the European Commission shows that individual actions are helpful: since our 
<a href="/news/2024/news-20240719-01.html">last news item on this 
subject</a>, as we’ve already seen how contacting 
officials has been helpful to shift opinions. As the allocation 
of funds for Horizon EU 2025 is still going on, there is still a chance 
to get funds available for NGI:</p> 

<ul> 
<li>Continue to <a 
href="https://commissioners.ec.europa.eu/ursula-von-der-leyen_de#paragraph_343">contact 
Ursula von der Leyen (President EU Commission)</a>, and/or <a 
href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/write-us">DG Connect</a>, 
to ask them to make the funds available.</li> 

<li>Help us make member states aware 
of and understand this issue. <a 
href="https://www.ideal-ist.eu/representatives">Contact your National 
Contact Point (NCP)</a> 
and persuade them to also advocate for the NGI funds to be made 
available.</li> 

</ul>
