    <description>
      The June 29th 2007 release of version 3 of the GNU General Public
      License (GPL) marked the end of an eighteen month public
      consultation process. During this time, the FSFE worked to raise
      awareness of the changes proposed for the licence, to help the
      community to participate in the public consultation, and to
      document the ongoing discussion to make this topic as accessible
      as possible.
