  <h1>Call for sessions at the FSFE assembly during 35C3</h1>
  
 	 <p>In the context of the 35th Chaos Communication Congress happening from December 27th to 30th in Leipzig, the FSFE is happy to host an assembly again, acting as an information booth and a meeting point for our friends and all friends of Free Software. As in previous editions, we offer attention and a stage for self-organised sessions by and for our community, and this is our call for participation.</p>

	<p>For our sessions at the FSFE assembly, we are looking for inspiring talks, hands-on workshops, community/developer/strategy meetings or any other public, informative or collaborative activities. Topics can be anything that is about or related to Free Software. We welcome technical sessions but even more we encourage to give non-technical talks that address philosophical, economical or other aspects of/about Free Software, in particular about growing diverse communities. We also enjoy sessions about related subjects that have a clear connection to Free Software, for example privacy, data protection, sustainability and similar topics. Finally, we welcome all backgrounds – from your private project to global community projects.</p>

	<p>Do you have something different in mind?  For our friends, it is also possible to have informal meetings, announcements or other activities at our assembly.  In this case, get in touch and we will see what we can do.</p>
