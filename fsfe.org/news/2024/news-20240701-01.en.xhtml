<h1>Europe needs Free Software to master its digital infrastructure  
</h1>

<p>The FSFE calls upon the European Commission to use Free Software to 
ensure a secure and resilient digital infrastructure. Software freedom 
will also benefit the economy, civil society and 
democracy.</p>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) provided last evening its <a 
href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14168-White-Paper-How-to-master-Europes-digital-infrastructure-needs%3F/F3470875_en">input 
to the European Commission's consultation</a> on the white paper "How to 
master Europe’s digital infrastructure needs?". As an advocate for 
software freedom, the FSFE underscores the crucial role of Free 
Software in building secure and resilient digital infrastructure for 
Europe while strengthening economy, democracy and civil society alike.</p>

<p>Challenges around digital infrastructure occur at global, regional 
and local levels, often revolving around control and access. 
Collaboration and openness are playing just as important role as the 
capability and skills to swiftly and effectively fix issues. 
Challenges addressed by the White paper could be addressed by 
redirecting IT investments in software freedom instead of procuring 
closed source, proprietary software. This approach not only boosts the 
European IT landscape and creates jobs but also saves costs and 
resources in the medium and long term by avoiding the need to 
repeatedly reinvent the the wheel.</p> 

<p>
<blockquote>“The European digital infrastructure, the European tech 
market, the IT skills of Europeans and civil society would greatly 
benefit if investments in software adhered to the principle of “Public 
money? Public Code!” We need software that fosters the sharing of good 
ideas and solutions. Like this we will be able to manage and improve IT 
services and digital infrastructure all over Europe. We need software 
that guarantees freedom of choice, access, and competition. We need 
software that helps public administrations regain full control of their 
critical digital infrastructure, allowing them to become and remain 
independent from a handful of companies. Therefore, laws and programs 
are needed, that publicly financed software developed for public sector 
must be made publicly available under a Free Software licence. 
Investment in the Free Software ecosystem will pay off quickly while 
strengthening Europe infrastructure, economy, democracy and civil 
society alike.” <cite>, demands Alexander Sander, FSFE’s Senior 
Policy Consultant.</cite>

initiative aims to establish Free Software as the standard for publicly 
funded software. The "Public Money? Public Code!" initiative of the 
Free Software Foundation Europe is supported by over 200 organizations 
and administrations.</p>
