<h2>Join the revolution</h2>
<h1>Interships at the Free Software Foundation Europe</h1>
</center>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) operates
in a lively environment of numerous volunteers from many countries and
several full-time employees, among which there is always the
opportunity to intern at the FSFE. The following description of
activities and requirements was written by FSFE's second intern,
Karsten Gerloff -- it will give you an idea of what is expected and
you can expect.</p>

<p>Currently, there are about 1,5 permanent internship positions
available as we prefer internships to have some overlap for peope to
get the chance to transfer responsibilities and hand over experience
in a smooth way. The geographic focus of internships is Hamburg,
Germany and if you are interested in becoming an intern with FSFE,
please contact <a
href="mailto:office@fsfeurope.org"><b>office@fsfeurope.org</b></a> to
hear whether there is availability for your preferred timing.  </p>

<h3>31 May 2005, Karsten Gerloff</h3>

<p>
    Before starting with the details, a few words about my own experience as an FSFE intern:
</p>

<p>
    If you've followed my <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/Members/gerloff/blog">blog</a>, you will have an idea of what I did with my time. The FSFE is a great place to work, and I've enjoyed almost every single day. In few other companies or organisations would I have had the chance to do useful work and learn in an international context like I did here. Take this chance, if you can.
