      <p>Matthias Kirschner, president of the FSFE will talk about how to get children involved in Free Software. The Free Software Foundation Europe’s volunteers and staff have interacted with over 2000 children between 6 to 10 years in the past months. Children, especially girls, afterwards were motivated to start experimenting with hardware and software. In the discussions we saw that they realise how crucial technology will be for them. Furthermore with the FSFE’s coding competition “Youth Hacking 4 Freedom” we gathered experiences working with teenagers who program, tinker, and have fun with software. Learn more about the experiences how the FSFE sparks children’s and teenagers interest to tinker, experiment and program. Furthermore you will see how fulfilling those activities can be for yourself. The lightning talk will take place at Nextcloud Community Conference 2025, bUm, Paul-Lincke-Ufer 21, 10999, Berlin between 12:05 and 12:12. The event is free of charge, but registration is required.</p>
