    <title>[Blog] Report from our German speaking team meeting 2014 </title>
	<body>

    From 13 â€“ 15 June 2014 FSFE had its German speaking team meeting in the
    Linuxhotel in Essen. The participants had some problems to travel there
    because of the chaos resulting from a heavy thunderstorm in the region. A
    lot of train lines where not functional, and the situation on the streets
    was also chaotic. But just because no ICE trains stop in Essen does not
    mean we will not continue our work for Free Software. In the end we were
    able to bring all volunteers to the Linuxhotel to plan further activities
    and discuss current issues.
