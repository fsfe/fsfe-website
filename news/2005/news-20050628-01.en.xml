Members of the European Parliament have been given a copy of the
Karlsruhe Memorandum against Software Patents 2005.  Issued by Free
Software Foundation Europe, this memorandum collected more than 200
signatures at this year's GNU/LinuxTag conference in Karlsruhe. Citing scientific evidence, the text argues that software patents in Europe will hurt jobs and innovation. Among the supporters are Europe's biggest trade union groups.
