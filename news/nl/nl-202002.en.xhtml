	<h1 id="fsfe-newsletter-february-2020">(pre-)FOSDEM +++ ILoveFS +++ Community</h1>

	<p newsteaser="yes">From our own pre-FOSDEM event, to the exciting FOSDEM weekend, to I love Free Software day, February was full of exciting news for the FSFE. We used these occasions to present our work, as well as to offer communities around Europe the opportunity to present their own. Read about our booths and presentations, about love and upcoming events in our February Newsletter.</p>

	<h2 id="fsfe-pre-and-post-fosdem">FSFE pre- and post-FOSDEM</h2>
	
	<p>Every year, at the beginning of February, FOSDEM brings together thousands of Free Software enthusiasts for one weekend in Brussels to discuss current topics and developments in the Free Software world. The FSFE used this occasion to invite key Free Software groups of Europe one day before the FOSDEM festivities to participate in our <a href="https://registration.fsfe.org/Pre-FOSDEM-2020">&quot;pre-FOSDEM meeting&quot;</a>. This was an event for everyone to network and get an overview of the activities of different Free Software groups from all over Europe.</p>
	
	<p>The event was kicked off by a presentation from Marcel Kolaja, Vice President of the European Parliament, which was then followed by insights and presentations from diverse Free Software organisations from all over Europe, from Portugal to Greece. After the presentations, we concluded with a dinner and a social meeting.</p>

	<p>During FOSDEM itself, our infobooth was in great demand and our highly motivated team put smiles on many faces. At the same time, we were present with talks about the latest issues regarding FSFE and software freedom all over the conference. Lucas Lasota presented <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/router_sovereignty/">&quot;Regaining sovereignty over your router - Router freedom&quot;</a>, Max Mehl showed how you can <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/reuse_code_licensing/">&quot;Go REUSE to license your code - Free Software licensing made simple for everyone&quot;</a>, Vincent Lequertier reflected on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/ai_in_peoples_hands/">&quot;Putting Artificial Intelligence back into people&#39;s hands - Toward an accessible, transparent and fair AI&quot;</a> and Matthias Kirschner talked about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/software_freedom/">&quot;The core values of software freedom&quot;</a> as well as his lightning talk about how <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/free_software_hackers_needed/">&quot;Civil society needs Free Software hackers&quot;</a>.</p>
	<p>We completed our presence with social evenings for our community on Saturday and Sunday night. A big thanks to everyone who participated in our events, helped at our booth and passed by for a chat.</p>
	
	

	<h2 id="ilovefs-day">ILoveFS day</h2>

	<p>Love is like Free Software: it multiplies when you share it. So once every year we square it up by celebrating &quot;I love Free Software&quot; Day around the globe on 14 February. A day full of positive, creative and lovely messages for Free Software, individual contributors and communities. </p>

	<p>In 2020 again we have seen massive participation throughout the day in many countries and languages. This year we saw an extraordinary growth in the fediverse where <a href="https://mastodon.social/@JayVii_de/103675049401883155">Jan Weymirsch counted an increase from 194 messages in 2019 to 330 in 2020</a>. This is an outstanding increase of 70%! Stay tuned for the upcoming full report and please accept our special thanks to every one of you who participated in #ILoveFS by sharing or receiving love.</p>

	<h2 id="what-have-we-done-inside-and-outside-the-fsfe">What have we done? Inside and Outside the FSFE</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>In order to defend <a href="/activities/routers/index.html">Router Freedom</a>, on 4 February, <a href="/about/people/lasota/lasota.html">Lucas Lasota</a> took part in the workshop organised by BEREC at the IRG Secretariat in Brussels  about the Guidelines on the identification of the Network Termination Point (NTP). The Guidelines will enter into force in June 2020 and will have a central role in shaping the Router Freedom panorama in Europe. The FSFE <a href="/news/2019/news-20191120-01.html">took part in the public consultation</a> to push forward the main arguments in defense of people&#39;s freedom to choose their own digital equipment.</li>
		<li>Apart from the many presentations at FOSDEM mentioned above, our legal experts Gabriel Ku Wei Bin and Lucas Lasota took part in the Meetup for the <a href="/activities/ftf/ngi0.en.html">Next Generation Internet Initiative</a>, for which the FSFE does consulting regarding Free Software licensing and compliance issues -  as well as the promotion of the <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE initiative</a>. <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/bof_ngi_meetup/">At the meetup</a> there were many opportunities to get one-on-one contact with the various software projects involved and to develop constructive dialogues with other consortium partners. </li>
		<li>The FSFE is hiring: <a href="/news/2020/news-20200129-01.html">We are looking for interns and trainees</a> experienced in legal, policy or technical fields. These persons will work 35 hours per week with our team in the FSFE&#39;s Berlin office. There will be coordination with remote staff and volunteers, and depending on the work area an opportunity to participate in events and meetings throughout Europe. </li>
		<li>At the Chaos Communication Congress 2019, the FSFE was one of the main organisers of the cluster about:freedom, an association of 12 civil society organisations and groups. Together with the other organisations, we focused on digital rights and network policy issues. Read our report <a href="/news/2020/news-20200121-01.html">&quot;about:freedom - about:fsfe&quot;</a></li>
		<li>In 2020&#39;s first episode of our monthly Software Freedom Podcast, <a href="/news/podcast/episode-4.html">we talk with Carmen Bianca Bakker about the REUSE project</a>.

<h2 id="get-active">Get Active</h2>

	<p>Our initiative “Public Money? Public Code!” has the purpose that Software, funded by public money and used in the public administration shall be Free and Open Source Software. We have an open letter, which you can sign as an individual or as a NGO. So far we have over 26.000 people and nearly 200 NGOs supporting our goal. Next to this we have already three administrations who have signed our letter but still we would like to have more administrations supporting our cause. To achieve this we need your help: Contact your local administration and <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/ContactingAdministrationsForPMPC">ask them to support public code</a></p>
