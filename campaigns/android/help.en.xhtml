		  The various Free Software initiatives also need help
		  and we need to ensure that they stay free as in freedom.

	<h2 id="OS">Operating Systems</h2>

	<p>
	The Replicant initiative is in urgent need of help.
	It lists <a href="http://replicant.us/how-to-help/">many ways to help out</a> on its homepage.
	</p>

	<p>
	Even though other versions of Android are all based on Free Software,
	sometimes non-free applications are added to these ROMs.
	If you know about non-free software added to CyanogenMod or other versions of Android,
	please <a href="mailto:android&#64;lists.fsfe.org">let us know</a> about it!
	We collect <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Android#Non-Free_Parts">current information</a> in the wiki.
	</p>

	<h2 id="Apps">Apps and F-Droid</h2>

	<p>
	The F-Droid initiative <a href="http://f-droid.org/contribute/">lists many ways to contribute</a>.
	Have a look!
	Maybe there is something that you can do easily.
	</p>

	<p>
	Other than that, you can help to make F-Droid <a
	href="https://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=3789">preinstalled
	on CyanogenMod</a> so more people can benefit from a free market.
	Other proposals to spread the word about F-Droid can be found in
	<a href="http://f-droid.org/forums/topic/spreading-the-word-about-f-droid/">the F-Droid forum</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Adding Apps Yourself</h3>

	<p>
	You are encouraged to add applications To F-Droid yourself.
	A <a href="http://f-droid.org/manual/">manual is provided</a> to help you.
	There is a long queue
	of <a
	href="http://f-droid.org/forums/forum/submission-queue/">applications
	that wait to be added</a>. Adding them works similar to <a
	href="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html">FreeBSD ports</a> and <a
	href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/handbook/handbook.xml?part=2&amp;chap=1#doc_chap2">gentoo
	ebuilds</a> by filling a simple recipe file which controls how a package
	is build from source. If you like to add apps yourself, you should read
	about <a
	href="http://f-droid.org/forums/topic/adding-apps-with-git/">how F-Droid
	works with git</a> and <a
	href="https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidserver/blobs/master/README">how
	to write these so called metadata files</a>.
	</p>

	  <h3 id="FreeingApps">Freeing Non-Free Apps</h3>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, there are still some applications that do not have a free
        alternative. To use the proprietary app is a bad idea; it takes away
        your freedom. In addition, if you settle into using the non-free
        program, you won't feel the need for it to be free. Even if you don't
        know how to program, you can <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/ConvinceYourFriends">contact</a> the authors
        of crucial apps and <a href="https://fsfe.pad.foebud.org/en-android">ask
        them politely</a> for their reasons for not publishing their app as Free
        Software. Many apps are available without payments, so money is not
        always the dominating reason. Sometimes one email can make a difference
        and there have already been successful attempts: <a
        href="https://market.android.com/details?id=cz.hejl.chesswalk">Chess
        Walk</a> for example is now <a
        href="https://gitorious.org/chesswalk/chesswalk">liberated</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Apps That Still Need To Be Liberated</h4>

      <p>
        We collect apps that have no free counterpart, but are important to have
        on a free system <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Android#Apps_That_Still_Need_To_Be_Liberated">in
        our wiki</a>. Please add other essential apps there. People can <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/ConvinceYourFriends">contact the authors</a>
        of those apps and ask them why they are not Free Software.
      </p>

      <h4>Responses to Objections We've Heard from App Developers</h4>

      <p>
        Only when we understand the motivation of programmers who keep their
        apps proprietary, we know what needs to be changed in order to change
        their minds and to convince them of liberating their own app. Please <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Android#Responses_to_Objections_We.27ve_Heard_from_App_Developers">contribute
        your experiences</a> with developers of non-free apps here and <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Android#Responses_to_Objections_We.27ve_Heard_from_App_Developers">share
        useful responses</a> to their objections.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Objection:</strong> If I publish my app as Free Software, I
          will not be able to make money with it. 
          <ul> 
            <li> You can still offer your app in other markets and ask for money
            there. </li> 
            <li> Offer options for people to donate. Free markets
            like F-Droid can include them and their users like to reward.
            Depending on your case, you might make more money with donations
            than from sales. </li> 
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Objection:</strong> But when my app is Free Software other
          people can distribute it without me getting profit. 
          <ul> 
            <li> That is true, but keep in mind that people who don't want to
            pay you will always find ways to do so. </li> 
            <li> If you ask people
            in a friendly non-obtrusive way and give them good reasons, they
            will give you money. </li>
            <li> If you publish your app under a copyleft license like the
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a>,
            then you are guaranteed that other people cannot distribute it without
            distributing the source code as well. Otherwise it is copyright
            infringement and you can contact the app store operator to take it
            down. </li>
            <li> You could tell people that in order to recognize and support your work,
            they should buy your application and not the other copies
            that might be distributed by other people. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Objection:</strong> I'm embarrassed by my bad code and don't
          want anybody to see it (from <a
          href="http://blog.flattr4android.com/?p=52">Flattr4Android</a>). 
          <ul>
            <li> Your code is very useful to many people and it works. Of course
            good code would be better, but code quality is secondary to freedom.
            </li> 
            <li> Everybody wrote bad code at some point. Sharing it will
            enable others to help you improving it. </li> 
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
