        <title>FSFE Community Meetup in Cologne in Cologne, Deutschland</title>

    <body>
      <p>There will be a public Meetup of the Free Software Foundnation Europe in Köln on 22/09/2023 starting at 19:30. We will meet at the Italian restaurant ECCO (Severins-Viertel, Kartäuserwall 7-11).</p>
      <p>Are you from Cologne and the surrounding area? Are you interested in Free Software and the work of FSFE? Or have you been involved as a volunteer or supporter for a long time and want to talk about FSFE's current initiatives like <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">"Public Money? Public Code!"</a> and Device Neutrality? This evening is a good opportunity to do so in a relaxed atmosphere. If you register under the following link, you will make our planning easier. Participation is free of charge.</p>
