		<div id="introduction">

			<p>Are you organising a Free Software meeting or even a Fellowship
evening? You like to promote Free Software and the FSFE? Then we'll be happy to send you our promotion material, of which you find an overview on this page. You might either order our default promotion package or order individual quantities. Material and shipping is for free, please find all details below.</p>
		
		</div>

		<h2 id="id-why-and-when-to-order">Why and when to order</h2>

		<p>There are various reasons why and when you might like to receive promotion material for Free Software and the FSFE. Maybe you know a location (e.g. a Hackerspace, a youth club, your office...) where you would love to see information about our mission? Or you would like to tell someone (e.g. your friends, your family, your colleagues...) about Free Software, the FSFE and what we are doing? Or you are even planning a public activity (e.g. a booth, a meeting, a conference...) to promote FSFE and its goals? These are just some examples for the various usage of our promotion material. Please, feel free to decide for yourself when, why and for what you would like to use it. </p>

		<h2 id="id-how-and-what-to-order">How and what to order</h2>

		<p>To order promotion material please use the following order form. You might either 
order our default package or tell us explicitly what kind of promotion 
material you need or prefer. For example, if you plan to support a 
special FSFE`s campaign. Please keep in mind, that for postal reasons, 
in general we just send packages up to 1kg. If you need more, please ask.</p>

On the inside of these folders, there is written some core information about FSFE, Free Software and how to contribute. They are available in an English and a German version. These folders are made to handle additional paper with more information inside, they are available in size A4 and in size A5. Inside of the latter, we normally put our <a href="https://fsfe.org/about/printable/">political leaflets</a> and/or our Fellowship leaflets (see next item). The others, the ones in size A4, can be useful in other contexts, for example to spread informations to the attendees of a conference.</p>
