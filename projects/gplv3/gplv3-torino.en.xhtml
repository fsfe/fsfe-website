<h1>The future of Free Software in Turin</h1>

<p>On March 18th, Richard Stallman will talk in Turin (Italy) over the future
  of Free Software, introducing the Italian audience to the updating process of
  the GNU General Public License (GPL), the licence that protects the
  freedom of about 100 million software users in the world, being the most used
  of the Free Software licences.
</p>

<p>The meeting will be hosted by the Politecnico di Torino and will be open to
  developers, technicians, managers of the private and public sector who want to
  have an insight into the new GNU GPL, whether they are currently using Free
  Software, or they are evaluating its adoption.
</p>

<p>The conference will be focused on the goals of the Free Software Foundation
  in the licence updating process, and on the rationale for the most
  controversial issues, such as DRM, the new patent retaliation clauses and the
  new compatibility provisions.
</p>

<p>The conference will be held on March 18th from 9:30 to 13:30 at</p>
