      Microsoft has steadily been soliciting supporters of the European
      Commission antitrust case to withdraw their support for the Commission
      by offering a series of financial settlements. The agreement with Sun
      Microsystems to withdraw has now been joined by financial settlements
      with Novell and the CCIA, in which they also agreed to withdraw from the
      case.
