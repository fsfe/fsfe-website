WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
If we then look at a U.P. level, we have a commissioner for tax opportunities or also make sense

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.000
to have a ministry in Germany that is, so to say, account the part to this.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.840
So I think the time is now to come up with something like this, that's for sure.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.480
But it's absolutely unclear how strong this ministry will be, what's the scope and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.120
accept the person and this also something important, you need somebody who is not only

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:47.560
becoming the needed knowledge, but also with the engagement and power to come up with change.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.720
Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast, this podcast is presented to you by the Free Software

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.720
Foundation Europe.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.480
We are a charity that empowers users to take control of technology.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm Bonnie Mehring, and today I'm here with Alexander Sander.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.880
Alex, who has now been a regular guest on this podcast, is the Senior Policy Consultant

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760
for the FSFE.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.120
And in his work for the FSFE, he monitors the happenings in the European Union and also pushes

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.760
for the recognition of Free Software.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.480
Together, we will cover the latest developments at Germany in regard to the policy and

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.320
the Coalition Treaty in Germany.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.000
This treaty was formed by the Conservative parties, CDU and CSU, and the social democrats

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.320
called SPD in Germany.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.840
Thank you, Alex, for being here.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.200
Thank you so much for making the time and to walking us through the Coalition Treaty and also

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.200
the latest developments.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.200
Thank you very much.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.120
Yeah, thanks for having me.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.920
So Alex, this treaty has now been out for around a week, as far as I remember.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.240
What is your first take on this treaty?

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.440
I guess it might have some spill over effect on the European Union as well.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.640
How do you think that this looks like?

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:15.280
Yeah, so I mean, we studied the treaty and there are definitely some things that most likely

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.440
will also have an impact on the European Union and its Germany as a large member state

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.440
of the European Union.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.440
It's also important to learn what the Germans are about to do in the next four years.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.440
And that's why this Coalition Treaty is not only important for Germany, but also for the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.440
European Union.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.040
In particular, then there are also some references to the European Union, how they want

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.040
to collaborate on the topic of Free Software.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.800
And yeah, for example, coming up with a shared deck and stuff like this.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.680
And yeah, let's dive into this and discuss a bit what we will see in the next four years

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.520
in Germany, but also in the European Union.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:03.400
And yeah, what to expect this will be pretty interesting as the devil is Austin in the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400
detail.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.960
I can imagine, and there are over 140 sides to this whole treaty.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.400
But how many sides are specifically on digital policies and the new digital minister?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.640
Well, I mean, it's for us it's not that important how many sides it's more on what

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.640
they say.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.920
And here there are just a few sentences that shed light on the topic of Free Software.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.160
And there are some also some other topics or words they use that also can contribute

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.160
to this topic.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.720
And this is what we are going to analyze now.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.800
I mean, also you mentioned that there will be a new ministry.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.480
And that also sort of important, but also here, it depends on like what the scope of this

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.280
ministry, how strong will the ministry be, also in the context to other ministries.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:08.040
And then ultimately, who is leading this ministry and how ambitious is this person towards

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.920
the goals that are not only in the treaty, but also in general, the knowledge and ambitions

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.880
of this person that are also something which should be recognized by analyzing and analyzing

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.880
this treaty.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:29.160
That let's start with what's in it on Free Software, in the treaty, they talk about open

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.160
source.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.800
And I mean, it's first of all, what's interesting is that they want to collaborate with

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:43.400
private and public actors in order to promote open source ecosystem, which is quite okay,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.120
I'd say, and it's also a reasonable goal.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.360
I mean, that's something we have seen in the past.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.800
Not only in private actors, we also need public actors, we need public funding, for example,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.520
we need procurement, all of these topics we already discussed in the podcast on funding,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.680
but also on the procurement rules.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.920
We have the campaign public money, public code, which is asking government basically to release

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.720
everything under Free Software Light and as soon as you invest public money in software.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:22.640
So there are already some step forward in the last years that also the German government

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:29.920
understood that Free Software plays an important role to reach digital sovereignty to have

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:38.400
a resilient IT infrastructure to be independent and to come out, for example, out of

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.400
vandalizing.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.320
So that's what also the upcoming government understood that also what is reflected in the

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.480
treaty, in the coalition treaty, however, if we then look at what they want to do

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.680
precisely, then it's getting a bit vague.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:03.280
So for example, they say that they want to define ambitious goals on the topic of open source,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.920
which means that they didn't define it yet.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.520
So the only thing that they agreed on is that they want to be ambitious and that this needs

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.720
to be defined.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.800
So we can already see that they are like upcoming work for us.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.840
I can't imagine.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.840
So this is something that is in the whole treaty, as far as I have here and rat in all of the

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:33.120
upper resources, that this is something which is a lot in this coalition treaty that there

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.720
are not specific goals or specific details, but that's more of a let's talk about this later

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.240
attitude and we will just kind of like do this.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.200
How do you see this in regard to Free Software?

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.600
Do you think that Free Software has a strong stand in the treaty or will be undermined?

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.040
That's actually in regard to open washing as well.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.800
Yeah, I mean, in general, that's why it's such a long treaty, I think.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:07.120
So since they didn't manage it to precisely agree on things, they had to describe things a lot.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.160
So that's why I also think there's upcoming work for us.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.920
I mean, the good thing is that they say they want to be ambitious.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:25.520
So that's something that we can also follow up and where we can or where we need to follow up and see

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.920
what this means in practice.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:35.280
Also, they give already some insights for example that they say they want to work with the sender

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.520
of digital sovereignty, for example, or the surrender agency, they also want to collaborate

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.880
a U.P. and why they also want to come up with a so-called German stack which should be

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.480
somehow collaborate and be embedded in the U-Stack initiative in Europe.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:58.080
So we can also already see that they have important actors on the radar and that they also

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.840
see that they need to collaborate. So that's something which is very, very good and very, very useful

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.440
and also needed. So in this regard, I'd say they found the right spot where they need to work

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:17.520
on what is missing is concrete goals. So for example, we want to see that 20% of the budget

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:25.440
is to be invested in Free Software, for example, or that we want to remove and 30% of our

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.280
window looking for something like this. So this is what's missing. The only reference we have

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.920
is that it needs to be ambitious. So if you look at this word, I think it's fair to say

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:43.920
we should compare it to what we're done in the past. So this means it needs to be better than the

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:50.800
last government. So else it wouldn't be ambitious, right? So it's not about keeping the status quo,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.400
but they say want to be ambitious, it needs to be better than before. So I think that's somehow

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:03.360
the threshold what we are looking for and so this is at least the bare minimum what we can expect

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:10.400
or what we should expect from the next government and this is then also I do believe something for

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:17.520
as soon as we have the new government where we need to follow up is then to make sure that the goals

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:23.360
that are defined are becoming one of the priorities of the next government. So as you also said

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:29.520
if you look at the coalition treaty in general, it's not only in the topic of Free Software

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.680
but in many other topics as well that they are remaining very vague and that they are not very

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.600
clear on their priorities. So it's absolutely unclear if they want to be ambitious in the beginning

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:48.480
of their legislative firm or in the end for example. So and this is on us as the whole Free Software

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:55.440
community to make sure that this topic is becoming a priority and if you look at the other

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.880
member states in the European Union and the European Union itself it also makes sense to bring

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.640
pressure to it since the others are also working on this and it doesn't make sense to be the last one

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.560
in the party but to join the party early and in particular for Germany it makes sense since they

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.160
already came up with solution like open desk and open code with the center of digital sovereignty

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:27.200
in the past to continue this path and to at the needed resources for this to go there and this is

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:34.320
another very important thing it's about budget. So also they talk about budget for these activities

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:40.560
and here they say they want to provide the needed resources but they don't say anything on how much

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:48.240
and when. So and this is also a huge problem also here in general for the whole coalition treaty

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.400
and they didn't talk about money they just say we want to do this we want to do this we want to do this

00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:01.440
if there is the money for this so and this makes it absolutely complicated since it's also not

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.200
clear again where they put their priorities to and also it's not clear where the money should come

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:14.800
for so it could be easy for them to say for like every topic they have in the coalition treaty

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.080
yes always sorry we don't have the money and this is again on other countries they put in this

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.760
very important sentence that I would also like to highlight because this is like this is

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:35.360
saying that will define the whole work of this coalition is to sentence if we have the money for it

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.400
and I find this very fascinating because this puts a lot of power to define an actual ministry

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:47.280
you're not only to the financial ministry but it's pretty clear that there will be huge discussions

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.480
between the ministry itself right so it's not then that the ministry of finance just distributed

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.520
to the money as he likes but there will be also discussions between the ministry the ministry of

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:04.800
economics the fight the ministry of environment for simply for resources and this also means that

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:11.280
there is a completely new ministry as you at in the beginning right this ministry of digital things

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.360
let's say it like this so it's also not I have you don't know the name exactly yeah

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.440
it's a country yeah so let's say the digital ministry so we don't know the name we don't know who is

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.680
going to run it and even worse we don't know the scope of this ministry so and it's also pretty

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:34.880
unclear how much power it will have how important it will be and how strong they can fight or defend

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.720
topics they work on so this is all very unclear at the moment and this is also where we

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:47.920
have huge debate or whether it's the huge debate and I mean you can pretty much compare with the

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:55.680
this German Bundestag so there two terms ago they introduced the committee for digital affairs

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:01.120
so where they want to discuss digital topics in a specific committee but this was not a leading

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.960
committee but just like a consulting committee so it didn't have the needed power to really

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:13.840
have a stance on digital topics so they have been absolute expert in this committee and they

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:19.600
talked about the right things I think however they didn't have the power to make that much change

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:26.400
also there was a missing ministry on the other hand this is now added I think that's a good thing

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:32.240
so that we have basically in the parliament a committee and we are also on the other hand have a

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:38.880
ministry also again if we then look at the U.P. level we have a commissioner for tax opportunities

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:45.360
or also make sense to have a ministry in Germany that is so to say account the part to this so I

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:51.280
think the time is now to come up with something like this that's for sure but it's absolutely unclear

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:57.440
how strong this ministry will be what the scope and accept the person and this also something important

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:04.560
you need somebody who is not only coming with the needed knowledge but also with the engagement

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:12.400
and power to come up with change and so therefore it's difficult to say at the minute where all of

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:18.960
this will end and land at one point and as you said on the other hand we have this issue of

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:26.080
finding things all of this and so it's the worst case is that we end up with these nice words but

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:32.000
then they say we are sorry there is no money but on the other hand I do believe that there's also

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.080
a huge pressure coming from other member states and the U.P. union also like from external partners

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.920
we see how important it is to have independent infrastructure we can rely on and the only

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:50.240
answer to this is setting up such infrastructure which is software and I also do believe that more

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:56.960
and more decision makers understand the need for software and I mean that this is basically the only

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:03.440
solution since they also and this is interesting they talk about open standards for example

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:09.440
and that they want to define them so and also they use words like indoor mobility,

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:16.160
U.P. in collaboration around software also we have some things on education that we talk about

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:24.240
resilience, digital sovereignty and all these words has been also used heavily in debate about

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:32.400
the attacks of our energy about like how we can independent from in particular external partners

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:38.880
that are not coming from the U.P. union and how we can make sure that there is so to say proper

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:45.920
U.P. in IT market so and if you look at all this description they come up so how this market

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:53.600
should look like and and how for example public administrations should use IT then you can only

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:59.600
come up with the is the saying that this is only possible with software or so you can't have an

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:05.920
interoperable U.P. in administrations so to say without Free Software so since you always want

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:13.440
into close standards you run into vendor not in if you don't use Free Software so if you

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:20.480
as you are as we have seen in the past using this proper territory solution so then you are stuck

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:27.520
and you can't collaborate you can't be interoperable and for this so even if they don't

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:33.440
precisely talk about Free Software open source they want to collaborate they want to be

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.800
interoperable and this I say is only possible with Free Software and this is then also something

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:44.800
where we as Free Software community need to step in and make sure that this is reflected once they

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.440
start working on this so they give us also some ideas some things where they want to

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:57.840
for example collaborate on U.P. in level on this on this stack so there are some some ideas

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:05.120
some are called one stack a U.S. stack then we have national stacks so in the coalition treaty

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:11.200
they talk about a German stack but they also recognize that it's absolutely meaningless to do this

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:17.520
in silos but to collaborate on this and this collaboration so to come up with a U.P. in stack

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:25.040
where member states and different actors, private and public actors contribute to such a stack

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:31.760
this could only be done with the software since the four freedoms to use study share and improve

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:38.720
allow this collaboration any other property thing wouldn't allow this wouldn't allow

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.920
interoperability and therefore the path could only be Free Software solution to work with and it's on

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.880
the other hand important for us to to discuss this things we also see other discussions happening

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:57.760
on the U.P. in the moment that are coming with slogans like by European or things like this

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:05.280
which is also a something in particular if you look at the software market or not over there

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:13.120
the Free Software market there is nothing like a national IT right so our IT is global

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:20.240
it was global it will remain global so else we can't run our infrastructure without open standards

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.200
we wouldn't have the internet for example and this is then also true for every other system so we

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:31.120
need to have open standards and for interoperability and collaboration we need a global approach

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:37.760
however if you look at the market you will also see that in in particular if you invest in

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:46.560
Free Software you will often end up with SMEs and if you procure in Europe Free Software you will

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:54.560
also most likely end up with European SMEs so you don't need this slogan by European if you say

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.760
we want to invest in Free Software and that's something where I fear that decision makers

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.480
haven't understood this correctly at the moment but this is then something we need to work on

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:10.960
and the term in the next term in the next four years on the national level but also on a European level

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:17.760
to make clear that if you want to have like a European stack where the European commission

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:23.920
together with the member states collaborate on such a solution that this is only possible with

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:29.840
software and if you do this you will also most likely end up with a lot of European SMEs which

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.800
just then also good for the European market but also we have spill over effect in the topics

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:43.360
the coalition treaty also talks about namely skills resilient consumers since they then will get

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:51.120
also the tools which are developed for public administration and can reuse them for example

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:59.920
in the civil society organizations but also this is what I highlighted in a Bundestag theory in December

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:07.600
think about fire fighters think about hospitals they also need infrastructure and we should also

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:14.480
give them resilient infrastructure and not a proprietary software coming from non-European countries

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:23.440
absolutely absolutely so to put a phrase on this all there are a lot of possibilities basically

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:29.600
for Free Software industry but none of it is yet sure and it's definitely a task for the

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:37.680
digital civil society to take a careful eye on this to watch this and to see what actually

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:43.920
happening and to also push for Free Software. Absolutely we can feed the coalition treaty as a

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:49.920
starting point to fight for goals like public money public code to fight for funding and

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:56.880
publicly discuss in a recent podcast together but also to make sure that educational resources or

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:03.440
that education in general has an eye on Free Software and that all of these words like

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.360
interoperability and so on and so forth are filled with Free Software so these are the tasks so

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:15.280
even if they are just a few mentions of the term open source in the coalition treaty there are

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:21.520
still many other points where if you read it correctly you the answer could only be Free Software

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.080
and this is what we need to make sure that decision makers understand if you want to have

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.440
digital sovereignty you can only do this with Free Software as exchange to the

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:37.680
nature of the free ones and that will be the most challenging task in the next four years and then

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:45.600
I've metly putting money to this. Yes this of course I also have another question now

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:54.080
not I found really interesting the recently had as symposium for public money public code

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.760
and a lot of people were invited to this and a lot of people showed up what is your feeling

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:06.080
currently is the understanding of Free Software and especially to need to invest public money

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:14.000
in public code what's your feeling there how is this moving ahead and how is it going and what

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.760
are the latest happenings here yeah so with this event public money public code in practice we

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:28.080
brought together mainly local administrations regional administrations with players from national

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:37.360
level and civil society to discuss how we can collaborate and how we can learn from collaboration

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:44.320
of others how we can network what is already out there where we can build on and I think this is

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:50.240
all to something which we can reuse for the next four years so as the coalition to it it talks

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:56.080
about public and private collaboration I also do believe that we should have the layer of civil

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:03.440
society to this and research since there is already also a lot of experience on how to collaborate

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:11.280
on and yeah using a strategies and ideas as proof print and this is something we need to make

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:17.200
way more use out of it so the benefit of using Free Software is that we don't have to reinvent the

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:23.680
wheel and this is not only true for the code itself but also for processes and how we get there

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:31.120
so in this is something where we I think waste a lot of resources since public administrations from

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:40.080
time to time try to yeah or are used to work in silos and they have to adapt their workflows,

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:47.520
their style of working towards a way more collaborative attitude and this is something where we

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:53.040
can learn from others so and this is also nice that the coalition treaty talks about this collaboration

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:58.480
so that they want to collaborate with other member states with other public administrations and

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:05.680
here I think this was shown in this symposium that there is already a lot out there which we can

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.640
reuse where we can build on and this is something which we can bring into the debate and show

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:18.320
pace so how well all of this is already established in some areas and for us it's important

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:24.000
that we shed light on these actors that has been always disrespectful and that we learn from them

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:31.360
and I do believe that this symposium brought together these people and shed some light on this

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.960
and this is something what we learned we need more and not only in Germany but also in

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:42.080
other member states and we need to make sure that these people interact and I think that will be

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:50.160
also key for the next five or four years depending on the Europe Germany is to make sure that

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:56.560
the actors that want to get active collaborate talk to each other and learn from each other

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:03.040
and in this regard these events help and this is also something where I do believe that

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:08.400
some money should go so if we talk about resources we do not only talk about technical

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:14.720
solution in the end we should always also look at the community around and this community I

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:22.720
do not necessarily mean the community we talk about but also the community's other talks about so

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:28.960
if you look for example at the center of digital reality their community is mainly companies

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:35.840
why so they need to bring together different companies that had to develop this open desk solution

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:44.160
if you look at Munich for example they collaborate with consul which is a tool which allows

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:51.840
participation for citizens and here they came up with a sponsorship since this is a foundation

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:57.280
and since you can't easily procure from them and this is also something we learn so

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:04.640
other than classical procurement procedures we need also to go other ways to work together with

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:10.320
the different communities and to come up with good solutions and it's not like that we if you

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:16.000
I don't know go on a market for chairs or something like this you just go there by the best chair

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.440
and then pull stop right so and you have right basically one vendor you talk to and then this is good

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.400
but if you talk about Free Software you can't just go to a market and procure something

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.120
sometimes you have to come up with other solutions you have to think about sponsorship you have to

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:38.400
think about giving the nation or just like a small amount of money into communities

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:45.520
to make something happen so and this needs a rethinking and for this rethinking we should learn

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:51.600
from strategies of others who already had good experience with this and where we don't have to

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:58.880
reinvent the wheel so to say not in the IT itself but in how we collaborate with the Free Software

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:04.560
ecosystem and this is something where the symposium shed a lot of light on and where we basically

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.760
where there was also a lot of agreement that you need to go other paths of collaboration

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:16.800
yeah that we know from the past for the fact all right that sounds very interesting and like

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:26.480
something we should have visited yeah so but we try to do more of these kind of events and also

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:34.240
I mean we have around public money public code it's easy to to get around and to like learn what

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:39.600
we are doing in this area and to collaborate with us so yeah join us in these kind of events

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.800
contribute to this and also do believe that this is something more or less everyone can do so

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.840
if you talk about Free Software it's not that much anymore that you need to explain people

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:56.320
the concept of Free Software but whether or not like that there is way more than code and

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.640
I mean we also have seen this with the corona tracing at the very site so

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:06.400
ultimately it was not that much about the code it was about the different communities that came

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:12.480
together to come up with a ultimately technical solution yeah but it was not only technically

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.680
people coming together and this is something what we can learn and more for that one absolutely so

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.080
and this is basically where we are today and what we need to explain so if you talk about

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:27.760
European interoperability we should not talk about technical communities coming together

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:34.960
but communities that are needed to come up with a good solution no in regard to who was there

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:40.160
at this symposium I would love to talk a bit more about Sanders because Sanders is also mentioned

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:47.360
in the coalition treaty and there has been the first personal decision made there can you

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:54.560
shed some light on yeah so this is basically the first very sad story also this is also

00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:00.960
a bit strange so to say so during this event we we had the CEO of the Center of the Children's

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:08.400
Organities of the 10th and 30th of a limited in German and Jutta Horstmann she also gave a very good

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.400
keynote and she also was on the panel with us discussing all of these questions I was just

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:22.880
referring to and now she was removed from this position just the very next day after our symposium

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:27.040
so we do believe that there is no direct connection to what she was saying there

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:35.440
I do have some but I mean in general we yeah just learn about this the very next day after

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:42.240
she was at our event that yeah she was removed from this position or to there is not anyone

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:49.120
new to be assigned to this position and also it was a bit unclear why she was removed so there

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:54.960
has been statements from the Ministry of Interior who basically sent the CEO to this

00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:01.920
Center of the Children's Organities and they were just saying like since we need to re-structure

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:10.000
we need to remove her which as we then go back to the beginning of this podcast doesn't make too

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.600
much sense since he still don't know the scope of everything right so and I doubt that the

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:22.720
Ministry of Interior is the one who comes up with the cabinet and will learn about how all of these

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:28.480
structure will look like so it rather looks like that they yeah use this moment to all by the

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:37.600
remove people that are not fully in line with what they are planning to do and this definitely

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:44.800
fears us so I think Jutta has done a very good job the University of the Children's Organities

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:50.880
she was also in the hearing in the German Bundestag explaining all the challenges that the

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:58.000
Center is facing at the moment however what we learn is that the new to the new formed Ministry

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:06.080
of the Children's whatever and so it's going to the Conservatives so the city will and since Jutta was

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:13.680
also a Queen Party member it might be that it was rather a political decision but what's happening

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:24.960
here then one based on what she has done and what she was planning to do so and in this regard we

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:31.360
definitely fear that Jutta will be replaced by someone who's not that much of an expert so we didn't

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:38.480
learn from from today on who will be the new person or the new CEO for for tennis and this

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:45.520
also looks a bit to me that it was a rather a very quick decision that was taken then a very

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:54.400
reflected decision and in particular as a such an important topic we also need stable decisions

00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:04.800
we need a continuation of things rather than people politics and power politics so and here it will

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:11.600
be definitely interesting to see if this change of the of the CEO position will also then

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:17.600
automatically come with changes in structures so until now we didn't learn anything about it

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.280
and also who's who's the next CEO of tennis and what will be the priorities of this person

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.720
so and for us it's important that we continue the good path that the tennis continues the

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.760
good collaboration they already started this European partner I think that something that they

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:39.920
just recently kicked off so that they are not working in the silo but that they collaborate not only

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:46.320
with in Germany with several public administrations on several levels what they are already

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:51.760
doing but that they also collaborate this European partner I think that's very important

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.560
and here we need to make sure that they don't lose ground and that they don't lose power

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:03.600
that they get the needed resources and also that they still do this good Free Software work

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.720
and that they don't start open motion so because this is also something we fear so if you go

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:14.400
through the coalition treaty and if you see a set is by European initiatives

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:20.480
the auto fear that there will be a lot of open motion around this and this is also why we need to

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:28.240
be still active in our watchdog roads this is a short break for our own cause thank you for

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:34.000
listening to the software feed-in podcast working for software feed-in and producing podcasts

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.960
cost money please consider supporting us with a donation on the fsfe.org/donate

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:48.640
and then the show knows and this is also why we need to be still active in our watchdog roads

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:54.720
we have seen this with data port phoenix back in the days in Germany so the very first attempt to

00:33:54.720 --> 00:34:00.160
come up with a so-called open source solution for public administrations we have eaten

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.240
checked for the licenses and figured out that this is not really open source what they are doing

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:13.760
but rather open motion so we hope we don't have to do this for for other solutions that the

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:19.040
German government so to say is coming up for so but that we make sure that this is really

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:24.000
Free Software what they are coming up with and that they continue the good past they just started

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.400
and that these ambitious goals that it needs to be set up are really ambitious and not watered

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:37.520
down in any way or that they end up with doing power politics and discussing people instead of

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:44.560
topics so this is something we need to make sure in this regard so this very first decision

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:50.080
basically so to remove yourself from this position was what's very strange to say

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:56.240
yeah absolutely I absolutely can understand especially in light that as you already mentioned

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:02.160
we do not really know what will be happening and we will only find us out doing the

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.920
coalition of those three parties and doing the formation of the German government so

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:14.400
it's really curious to see what what are the next steps what is the scope that will be there

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:19.120
for the digital ministry and also how Free Software will stand be as Free Software

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:25.280
foundation Europe and especially you will probably pay a lot of attention there is this correct

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.520
can we say this to our listeners that you will be there and you will watch that

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:38.960
yes absolutely also I will do this together with my colleague Johannes who is also very

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:45.280
actively working in Germany on all of these topics so and we also organized this symposium in

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:50.560
in essence Germany on the public money public code topic again and he also follows a lot

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:56.480
the topic of open washing he also already gave a lot of talks on this so he is also an absolute expert

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:04.560
on this so and in this regard also that this is a continuous call to our community if you see

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.680
these cases of open washing or if you see any cases where you say well this is against the

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:15.120
goals of the software foundation Europe or the Free Software ecosystem let us know right

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:21.280
of the email to contact us if it is or reach out for us directly on social networks or when

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:28.080
we are on conferences so help us to shed light on on these topics so because this also helps us

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:35.840
explaining and the issues to decision makers and making sure that they come up with these ambitious

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:41.680
goals that are really contributing to a Free Software ecosystem and not something which is

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:48.800
like basically open wash Alex thank you so much for your work thank you so much for your time here
