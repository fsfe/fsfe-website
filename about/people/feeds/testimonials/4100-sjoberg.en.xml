      I joined as a Fellow since I wanted to support FSFE's work to promote
      free software. As a person that uses computers quite heavily every day,
      I'm very concerned with the current trend of locking down computing which
      is taking control away from the users. This is increasingly problematic
      since people's lives are more and more dependent on computers for
      personal communications, managing finances, employment, etc. Free
      software is a necessary requirement for retaining control over your
      computing.
