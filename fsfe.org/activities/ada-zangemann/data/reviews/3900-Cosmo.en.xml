      "The story's engaging illustrations and relatable characters make it easy for children to understand the message, while also serving as a parable for adults who may not have had exposure to these concepts. I highly recommend Ada &amp; Zangemann to parents, teachers, and anyone who wants to inspire the next generation of innovators and tinkerers."
