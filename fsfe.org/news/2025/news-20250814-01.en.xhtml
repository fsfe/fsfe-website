	<h1>After 100 days: Germany’s government still lacks a Free Software
push</h1>

<p>On 14 August 2025, Germany’s government marks 100 days in office.
CDU, CSU, and SPD had pledged ambitious Free Software goals. Yet it
remains unclear what these goals actually are, how they will be
achieved, and what role Free Software will play in securing Germany’s
technological sovereignty.</p>

<p>In February, <a href="/news/2025/news-20250206-01.html">the Free 
Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) called on the
incoming government</a> to make the controllability, security, and
sovereignty of public digital infrastructures a top priority, and to
achieve this by consistently using Free Software (also known as Open
Source). Our core demands: <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">“Public Money? Public Code!”</a>, secure
long-term funding for Free Software, capacity building, and statistical
monitoring of progress. We need a genuine political push to <a 
href="/news/2025/news-20250103-01.html">turn the
“Public Money? Public Code!” vision into reality:</a> All public funding for
software must be for Free Software only!</p>

<p>100 days after the government took office, it is time to take
stock.</p>

<h3>Procurement reform: Free Software must be prioritised</h3>

<p>Only days ago, on 6 August 2025, the Federal Cabinet adopted a draft
law to accelerate public procurement procedures, aiming to make them
more efficient, flexible, and digital. While the draft includes the
possibility to consider digital sovereignty in tender criteria, it fails
to seize the opportunity to prioritise and simplify the procurement of
Free Software for public administrations. It is now up to the governing
parliamentary groups in the Bundestag to strengthen the draft.</p>

<p><strong>The FSFE calls</strong> for the “Public Money? Public Code!” principle to be
firmly embedded in public procurement, by giving Free Software clear
priority. This is the only way to end structural dependence on
proprietary software and its vendors, and to achieve true technological
sovereignty. Public administrations should also be obliged to regularly
measure and publish the share of Free Software in all software they
procure, commission, or develop. This would make progress measurable and
help detect undesirable developments.</p>

<h3>“Germany Stack”: National solo effort instead of European
cooperation?</h3>

<p>By 2028, the government aims to present a “Germany Stack” – a unified
IT architecture with base components such as cloud software and clearly
defined interfaces, according to Federal Digital Minister Karsten
Wildberger. But focusing on a purely national IT stack is a dead end.
Instead, European member states should become partners, aiming for joint
procurement and development with a focus on interoperability and sharing
solutions without reinventing the wheel over and over again. Without
coordination and collaboration at EU level, the stack risks
becoming an isolated project.</p>

<p>It is also unclear whether the stack will be developed as Free
Software at all. Transparency is lacking: At a first, non-public interim
presentation in early July, representatives from civil society, Free 
Software projects and their communites were excluded.</p>

<p><strong>The FSFE calls</strong> on the government to think and act at the European
level in developing an IT stack – working with European partners on a
joint stack rather than investing resources into a questionable national
solo effort. In any case, the Federal Ministry for Digitalisation and
State Modernisation (BMDS) must commit to Free Software and to open
standards compatible with Free Software, in order to create a real
alternative to proprietary products. Civil society and the Free Software
business sector must be involved from the outset to make use of existing
expertise, foster acceptance, and drive genuine change towards
technological sovereignty – at federal, state, and municipal levels, and
across Europe.</p>

<h3>Federal budget: No secure, long-term funding for Free Software</h3>

<p>After the presentation of the 2025 federal budget and the Bundestag’s
budget debate, it remains unclear how the government will ensure secure,
long-term funding for Free Software. There is no sign of a strategic
reallocation of the opulent spending on proprietary licences towards
Free Software in line with the “Public Money? Public Code!” principle.
The budgets for federal Free Software initiatives also remain
precarious, with far too little funding foreseen in the Ministry of the
Interior’s budget.</p>

<p><strong>The FSFE demands</strong> that the government provide secure, permanent
funding for Free Software in the public sector. In addition to a
procurement shift, this requires targeted financial support for Free
Software in central digital infrastructures. This must be clearly
reflected in this and all future federal budgets. Furthermore, the
still-to-be-prepared BMDS budget must include reliable funding for the
tasks of the Centre for Digital Sovereignty (ZenDiS), enabling it to
support public administrations on their path to technological
sovereignty through Free Software.</p>

<p>
	</p>
<blockquote>“If the German government is serious about digital sovereignty, it
must commit to Free Software. Only Free Software ensures vendor
independence, interoperability, and the freedom to innovate,” <cite>says
Johannes Näder, Senior Policy Project Manager at the FSFE.</cite> “This
requires secure, long-term funding for Free Software and for the federal
government’s own Free Software initiatives, especially ZenDiS. Free
Software must be given priority in public procurement under the ‘Public
Money? Public Code!’ principle. And any IT stack will only succeed if it
is developed entirely as Free Software – not in a national silo, but in
close cooperation with the EU, other Member States, and the Free
Software ecosystem.”</blockquote><p></p>

<h3>Background: The government’s own commitments</h3>
<p>The newly created Digital Ministry was established to serve as a
driver of digital transformation and a modern, capable administration.
Free Software was meant to play an important role. In their coalition
agreement, CDU, CSU, and SPD pledged:</p>

<p>“We will define open interfaces and open standards across all levels
and strategically promote Open Source with private and public actors in
the European ecosystem. […] To this end, we will strategically align our
IT budget and define ambitious goals for Open Source.”</p>

<p>In May 2025, at the re:publica conference, Minister Wildberger
reaffirmed this goal, saying that Free Software and open standards
should become the “guiding principle of the federal government’s digital
infrastructure.” In this context, the government plans to establish a
new Digital Agency under the BMDS, bringing together ZenDiS and the
DigitalService, and potentially other currently independent bodies.</p>

<p>The minister’s appearance at re:publica to engage with a critical
community was a welcome first step. Now it must be followed by genuine,
institutionalised participation of civil society. This is essential for
a digital transformation of public administration that benefits everyone
and makes Germany and Europe economically strong and fit for the future.
The time to act is now.</p>

<h3>Free Software and "Public Money? Public Code!"</h3>
<p>Free Software gives everyone the right to use, study, share, and
improve applications for any purpose. These four freedoms ensure that
similar applications do not have to be programmed from scratch every
time and, thanks to transparent processes, others do not have to
reinvent the wheel. In large projects, expertise and costs can be shared
and applications are available to all. This promotes innovation and
saves taxpayers money in the future. Dependencies on vendors are
minimised and security issues can be fixed more easily. The Free
Software Foundation Europe, together with over 200 organisations and
administrations, is therefore calling for “Public Money? Public Code!” -
If it is public money, it should be public code as well! More
information on the initiative is available on the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/en">"Public Money? Public
Code!" website</a>.</p>
