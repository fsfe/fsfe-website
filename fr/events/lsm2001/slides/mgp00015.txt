Free Software Foundation Europe

FSF Europe and the world

We are not the only one

Looking for Free Software Movement around the world

China, Japan, India, South Africa, Canada, maybe others ?

Show what we do, find out what they do

Working relations are slowly building

Tell people they can launch a Free Software Movement in their country
