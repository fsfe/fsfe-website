1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Before we start after the podcast, we would like to say thank you to all of you who support the FSF East Work of Money.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Working for software freedom and producing podcasts costs money.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Please consider supporting us with the nation on the FSFE.org slash donate and in the show notes.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Bringing these people together also takes time.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It needs energy, finding, coming, crown.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
See where we can work together.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This needs a lot of time.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Resources and yeah, if you donate to us, you make this work possible.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You make our fights for funding possible.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And then also one day we benefit you.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If you, for example, develop and maybe we get funds for your project in the future.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hello and welcome to the software freedom podcast.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We are a charity that empowered users to take control of technology.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm body married and today I'm here with Alexander Sander.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Alex is the senior policy consultant for the FSFE.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And in his work for the FSFE, he monitors the current happenings in the European Union

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and also pushes for the recognition of the software.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, today in this policy and EU episode, I don't know.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I find this is a tongue breaker, trying to understand.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
They are called tanked.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So you know what I mean?

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Alex and I will talk about our host and experience.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And especially the outcome of the two DevRooms that were on the FSFE.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Alex, thank you so much for making the time.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you so much for being here on our second try for the recording.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, thanks for having me.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay, so how was the two DevRooms?

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I remember they were not only run by the FSFE.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There were others involved as well.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So in the EU and policy DevRooms, who was involved again?

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So we partnering on two DevRooms, the legal and policy DevRooms that we are

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
organizing together with other organizations like the Software Freedom Conservancy,

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Red Hat, Tom Marble, something we started to work on together doing the corona crisis,

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the DevRooms itself is longer than a decade.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And it's very well established, DevRooms where we talk about SNS, legal and policy,

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
related issues.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And this year, we obviously again talked a lot about the cyber resilience act,

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
a topic that keeps the first them or one could say the broader Free Software community,

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
discussing for pretty much two years, I think we started to discuss during the first

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
them, the cyber resilience act.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And since we are now facing the implementation, some very practical questions arise.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Which is important for us in particular for the FSFE.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There is a so-called Stewart role introduced in the cyber resilience act,

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
so there are manufacturers, Stewart and the basically one could say individual developers,

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
these three roles are somehow given.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And there are exemptions in particular for people that don't earn money with free software

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
or smaller projects, projects that are non-profit projects,

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and here we discuss which role they might have in the cyber resilience act

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and what application might arise for them.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And how we can, in particular, support stewards in the relationship as manufacturers,

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
so that in particular, non-profit work is not destroyed by the cyber resilience act,

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
but in more important, maybe even supported.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And that was a huge discussion we had together with Michael from the German BSI,

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
so the Bundesant for Sicherheit in the information station,

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
so basically the IT security agency for Germany,

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
which also most likely be the market surveillance authority.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
For the cyber resilience act was there with me together on a session where we hosted,

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
yeah, basically a Q&amp;A session on this Stewart question,

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and I think that was very useful and intense discussion we had,

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
so we tried to address these issues,

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but also listen to the community what they see, what their fears are,

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and this ultimately will also end in a project that we run together with this German BSI,

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
this IT security agency,

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
where we precisely want to research on this question,

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
how the relationship between stewards and manufacturers will be,

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
so this first session could be also seen as a starting point to this research,

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and I would also like to use this postcard episode to,

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
to kind of as a call, so basically if you are a Stewart,

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
or if you believe you might be a Stewart,

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
a few, three to reach out to me directly or to contact at FFE.org,

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and we are working on a questionary which we want to share with manufacturers,

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
stewards and interested stakeholders,

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and in order to come up with this question there where we want to address those questions,

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
we are looking for input, so if you should have some,

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
it's recommended to you to watch the Q&amp;A session on this year,

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
from the first term,

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and maybe reach out to us if you have some input in this direction for us.

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
How was the Q&amp;A session, like how many people were there,

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and how, what was your feeling from the questions that,

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
where are those, that are those Q&amp;A session?

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Because we are just a cyber-resilience act,

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I believe this is the act that we discussed the most in the previous,

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
in the past year.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, it's definitely a huge discussion on going,

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and that's basically good, but bad at the same time.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's good since a lot of people take care of this very important topic.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The bad part is that there are some rumors and myths around the cyber-resilience act.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
One of our tasks is to explain what's really in, what's not in.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
However, there are still, as I said, many open questions

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
when it comes to implementation,

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
basically the needy-credi of transforming the sentences we have in the law,

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
into something which is working,

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and I think it is important for the community to know

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
that there will be basically, in the end,

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
a market surveillance authority who is doing this,

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and it's a good idea to talk to precisely this body,

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and since they really can't have this rules on how they do it,

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
how they see all of this, how they implemented,

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
so I think it's important to learn that,

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
basically, it's the market surveillance authority who says,

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
this is a steward, and this steward now needs to fulfill these obligations.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So that's why it's a good idea to talk to them,

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to listen what they have in mind,

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and maybe to advocate if it's going in a wrong direction.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So that was basically, I think, a very important point

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
we made during this discussion,

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and which helped the people, however,

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
so when it comes to the room,

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
we had one of these basically bigger lecture rooms.

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's very hard to guess how many people have been there,

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
so the room was pretty full,

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and there was a huge interest in this topic,

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
so I'd say a few hundred, maybe,

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
but don't talk me on that,

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
so I'm pretty poor in counting people.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
However, there was a huge interest,

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and I think, from the questions that came,

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
it's also clear that there is still a lot of uncertainty

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
when it comes to M-I-N-S-Dewart,

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and if I am a steward, what do I have to do?

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And I have to feeling that some people in our community

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
are feeling the rules,

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and that they think that, for example,

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
issue could be that some sort of

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
continuity agencies that don't have too much to do with open source,

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
want to be one of those stewards to earn money worth this,

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and how to prevent this,

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and I think there's also a lot of fear on the obligations

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that stewards might have that there's too much bureaucracy in this,

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and that they simply can't do it.

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And these are precisely the points we also want to

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
bring to the market surveillance authority,

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and for this I think it was also good.

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That they have been there, and that they have seen,

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
like physically seeing how people are worried about this,

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and that there is definitely needed to stay

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and touch with these people to communicate with these people

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
to include them in the debate,

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and to remove a bit of the fog,

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
which might be around this CIA,

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
because ultimately I think it has more chances than downsides,

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
if you play it right during this implementation.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And that's something I have to feeling that people understood,

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
so nothing is lost so far.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's still in the making,

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and we are actively searching for people contributing to this,

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and if our community understood,

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and this is I think what this panel definitely had for,

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
is that there is still room for improvements,

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
then this is something which is,

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
the solar effects, that's what I think.

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So as you said, that the people from their commissioner

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
are who, because there will be

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
some agency that will define this to us,

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
so people from this planned agency,

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
or who was there and saw that some people are very worried about

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
this whole server itself.

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So basically it's the person who is working in the BSI,

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
the sort of department, which might be in charge

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
of the Cyber Resilience Act in the implementation.

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The thing is that the CIA itself,

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
was just really released by the end of last year,

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
so member states are still discussing

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
who ultimately will be market surveillance authority,

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
so it's not set in stone,

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
but it's likely that the BSI will be,

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and ultimately the person who was there,

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and Michael is also the person,

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
this whom I'm running the project together with CBI,

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
in order to figure out how this relationship looked like.

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So basically, one could say the representatives

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
of the department that will be in charge was there,

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and for this, it's a thing,

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
that's also sort of a very strong commitment

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
that market surveillance authorities do not only want

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to work with manufacturers,

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
or that they have only in eye for the industry,

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but they also go actively to our community

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
in order to learn about our demands or fears,

181
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and I think that's something very valuable

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
that Michael showed up and not only listen,

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
but also actively to part in this Q&amp;A session

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and try to address those questions

185
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and trying to take away some of the fears

186
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
that are in the room.

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That I can imagine.

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But so this was a successful era

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and session in the EU and quality of what else happened there.

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I think that it must have been not the only session there,

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
right? There were loads more.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And here do you were hanging around there the whole day?

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, absolutely.

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So it's always a intense experience.

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I mean, we start at 10, 30 and at 7,

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
so that's quite a while.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And also I have to say that many people

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
stayed for the whole day in the room.

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So obviously we had an interesting agenda

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and often we also had to close the doors

201
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
since the room was so packed that we can't let everybody in.

202
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So for all of you that couldn't see the talk,

203
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
they wanted to see there are also recordings

204
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
on the first and back side itself,

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
where you can watch all the talks

206
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and also on FFE.org.

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You find the news item in the blog post

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
where we also report about what happened.

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I want to highlight in this podcast again,

210
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
a very practical talk we had,

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
which is on the mandatory B2B e-in voices

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and which this means for software.

213
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I think that was a very interesting talk

214
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
since it addresses a very practical hands-on question

215
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
that is basically coming to us,

216
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
which in the first place doesn't look like a free software problem,

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
but there are some strings attached to the free software community.

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So that was a pretty hands-on talk,

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think this is also always nice to have.

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Also we discussed in this like hands-on tool related topic,

221
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
a tool from the UBIN data protection board,

222
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
which is basically a compliance tool

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
where you can check how your website is in line with data protection laws

224
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and this is also an open source tool.

225
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So here we can see how UBIN institutions

226
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
also are made use of open source tools

227
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
in order to fulfill the obligations in order to help.

228
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Companies out there are in this case like,

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
yeah, people who run a website.

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Also I mean, which is very important for us,

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
in particular for the FSE is the discussion we have on the DNA

232
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and the Apple litigation case.

233
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So my colleague Lucas is working on basically

234
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
interoperability question when it comes to the App Store on iOS,

235
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
so Apple phones and tablets.

236
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And here we run a legal activity against Apple

237
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and that was in particular interesting

238
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
since there was a fire side chat with somebody

239
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
or with two people from the UBIN commission

240
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
that were giving insights in their daily work,

241
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
how they do this and yeah,

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
what questions arise when we talk about the gatekeeper issue,

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
device neutrality topics and how we legally try to enforce this

244
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
together with the commission to make sure that on the Apple,

245
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
as device is this in the future possible

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
to, for example, also install the F-Troid app store

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
and by that you will be able to also get apps.

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There are not coming from this Apple universe

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
but can be free software from the F-Troid store, for example.

250
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So a very interesting legal case.

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I think it will be somehow also covered in this podcast episode

252
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
since there will be some results one day

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and we hope to be able to safeguard device neutrality business.

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And yeah, that was also in particular,

255
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
since people from the UBIN commission showed up again

256
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I think a sign that's European institutions

257
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
that institutions in general do take care of what we do

258
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
that they follow our arguments even more

259
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and that they also even more up to also join these kind of like community events

260
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
like the first them and explain their work towards this community

261
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and I think that's also a very strong statement

262
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
from the commission to join these fireside chat.

263
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Where you know it's the first them,

264
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
people are very critical to people

265
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and they sometimes ask questions that are not so nice

266
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
for institution people or decision makers,

267
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
but they show up, they took the questions

268
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and that's I think something we should also value

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
that more and more people from the institutions

270
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
are coming on a week and to explain their work

271
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and that's also a good result of our work at check.

272
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah, it makes them more approachable, right?

273
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I just thought that this was like,

274
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
it's actually a chance to engage with policy makers

275
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and to talk about your fears and your thoughts

276
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and bring them to their attention.

277
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Absolutely, and I do believe a dialogue is always better

278
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
to have with the people we want to basically address

279
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
with our demands, so it's better to talk with them

280
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
instead of over them and for this I think it's also underlying

281
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
how important this event is and that they see

282
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
that it is an important event for them

283
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
to go there and to meet these kind of stakeholders

284
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
so that they are not only meeting the industry

285
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
in the hidden hotel during the week,

286
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
but that they also actively go on a Saturday

287
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
to the university to an event

288
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
which is absolutely crazy

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and if you have there for the very first time

290
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
in particular, if you are living in the process but

291
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
it's the complete opposite of what you normally see

292
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
how people advocate for something

293
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and that they do the step that something

294
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
really valued a lot.

295
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Okay, I can't imagine, I think that's a very nice of them

296
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and it shows a lot of commitment to the community.

297
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is a short break for our own cause.

298
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Thank you for listening to this afternoon podcast.

299
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Working for software freedom and producing podcasts,

300
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
cost money.

301
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Please consider supporting us with a donation

302
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
on the ffs.org slash donate at the show notes.

303
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So this was the legal and policy too.

304
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That room.

305
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But I remember we had two.

306
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yes.

307
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
We did have another one.

308
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It was one on Sunday.

309
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah.

310
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It was the post funding.

311
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah, since this other day it's not enough of work.

312
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I also decided to have no with some other organizations

313
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
to come up with a funding there from here.

314
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
For example, we worked with the sovereignty agency from Germany.

315
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
We worked with the Linux foundation, the prototype fund.

316
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So people that are also already active in this sphere of funding.

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We came together, I'd say,

318
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
mid last year and decided on the idea to propose a funding

319
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
that room.

320
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
We precisely discussed basically all questions that arise

321
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
from funding.

322
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So for example, from whom do you want to take funding?

323
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
From whom not?

324
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Is there a way how we can identify, for example,

325
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
very important projects or core infrastructure that we want to support?

326
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
How much money do we want to give them?

327
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Is there some sort of communication or some sort of activity

328
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
to be more successful in fundraising, for example?

329
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So there are many discussions on funds on funding on where

330
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
money should come from, and all of these discussions

331
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
happening here and there, but not like on one place.

332
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And that's why we decided to come up with this dedicated funding

333
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
that room and I think that was also a huge success.

334
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So also this room was pretty packed during the whole day.

335
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And we had many, many submissions also in the first place.

336
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So we had to be very picky on the talks we had.

337
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And ultimately, but I think we came up with a very, very nice agenda

338
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
that addressed most of the topics that somehow arise

339
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
when we talk about funding.

340
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And also the discussions after every talk show that there is really

341
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
in need for this discussion that there is a lot of expertise.

342
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Also, that was very nice to see that many participants who

343
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
maybe had been rejected by their talk due to the nature of this very short date,

344
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
which we had basically just eight hours, where we discussed this topic.

345
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But still in the room and sharing the expertise.

346
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And that was pretty nice to see that it was not just like people talking

347
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and sharing the experience from the stage, but that there was also a lot

348
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
of interaction with the people in the room that also not only ask questions,

349
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
but also added a lot of very useful information.

350
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And for example, sources, so where you can look for money,

351
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
how to do this, they shared the experience.

352
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And I think that was basically what the deaf room should look like, right?

353
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So that there is a discussion ongoing that there is,

354
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
one could say, something starts there.

355
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So I had a feeling that after this deaf room,

356
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
more and more people are now connected and can work together and collaborate on these questions.

357
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So I would be very happy to see this deaf room again next year,

358
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and maybe to see if there was already some sort of progress.

359
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Or if there are some new questions, I mean,

360
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
we both also talked about the funding topic that we discussed.

361
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I think two at this also go, go.

362
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So there are also discussions ongoing, not only in the European Union,

363
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
but also in member states and globally,

364
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
how to invest in core infrastructure,

365
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
how to invest in digital to sovereignty,

366
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
but world plays free software and all of this.

367
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And I think it's a good idea that our community is networking and collaborating on those questions in order to be able to influence these discussions happening on the European level.

368
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Like this input from us,

369
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
because I do believe that our community is basically that one that can help in this debate a lot,

370
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
in order to identify who are the people that need money,

371
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
which are the projects that need support,

372
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and which are the other projects where we could also say,

373
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
this is something that the market should invest,

374
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and not us taxpayers money.

375
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I think there are different sources we need to discuss,

376
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
we are managed to come from and it should always be private and public.

377
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So in this, these are some questions that are not that easy

378
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
to discuss when it comes again to the needy query,

379
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and here I think it's a good idea if we can up this idea as out of our community ourselves,

380
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and point to the right project that needs support,

381
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and discuss this also within our community,

382
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
how we do believe funding for the free software ecosystem should look like,

383
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and what's good for us is community and what not.

384
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And therefore this deaf room was super helpful.

385
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It was also pretty hands on if you are a project and you struggle with finding money.

386
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
There are definitely talks, you should watch again,

387
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
also here these talks are all recorded.

388
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So you can go on the first step side,

389
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
channel to the deaf room, click the talk,

390
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and you will find the recording of the talk.

391
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So you can watch all of this again,

392
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
or I said, saying here we will also have a blog post,

393
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and use the item on fissivee.org.

394
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Where we report about this deaf room,

395
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
and where you can also find recordings and rewatch,

396
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
what's interesting for you.

397
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And I will also link them in the show notes.

398
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes.

399
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Perfect.

400
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Not all of the videos separately,

401
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
but the deaf room that you can go through the talk.

402
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Exactly.

403
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And then what's the recording?

404
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Because otherwise it would be a bit too much.

405
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Maybe I can attach also here,

406
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
a call to our community,

407
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
or to our listeners of this podcast episode.

408
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So if you are working on the topic of funding,

409
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
or if you are interested in the topic of funding,

410
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
if you want to contribute with this debate,

411
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
you're also free to reach out to me directly,

412
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
or to contact at fissivee.org.

413
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So we are still in the very early phase,

414
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'd say, of this debate,

415
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and it will keep us busy,

416
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I do believe for the next term.

417
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So basically for the next five years,

418
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
you should debate,

419
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
we are discussing,

420
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
you will stick a one-stack,

421
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
we are discussing core infrastructure,

422
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
we are discussing innovation in Europe,

423
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
the new digital program will be coming up into years

424
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
where there might be potential sources for funding.

425
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So the discussion is just about to start,

426
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
so if you want to take part in this discussion,

427
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
if you have ideas,

428
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
if you have points,

429
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
or if you also have experience,

430
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
which is a big interest for us,

431
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and if you are free to reach out to us.

432
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That one's a good idea to get all of us,

433
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
if you could together,

434
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and to start with this discussion,

435
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
also outside of Boston.

436
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But what was the best thing that happened in this,

437
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
of course,

438
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
funding,

439
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
deaf room for you,

440
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
like what really stood out for you?

441
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
What was the something I better to ask us to hire to name?

442
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So I don't want to pick a specific talk,

443
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
but what I really liked was,

444
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
what I already said,

445
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
that there was a lot of interaction in the deaf room.

446
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So, and that there was basically participants,

447
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and speakers have been on eye level,

448
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
and it had been a very good exchange.

449
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I do believe that also speakers took some sort of information

450
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
that was new to them away from this deaf room,

451
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and that's something which is really good.

452
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And I do believe also that this deaf room helped a lot,

453
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and in order to bring people together,

454
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
to see who else is working on this topic,

455
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and to be able to network with those people,

456
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and to be able to collaborate in the future,

457
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and that's,

458
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I think,

459
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
the biggest result of this deaf room,

460
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and yeah,

461
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
bringing people together,

462
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and pointing to it,

463
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and giving it the importance with,

464
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
like also a dedicated deaf room,

465
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
showed that there is the need to discuss this,

466
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
that there is a need from the community,

467
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and people are already working on this,

468
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
but that they are not,

469
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
well, network together,

470
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
but this room definitely had to,

471
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
to create this,

472
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
get people closer together,

473
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
absolutely.

474
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And that was,

475
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
that was basically the best outcome for me,

476
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
however,

477
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
as said,

478
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
so there is definitely something,

479
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
which is super interesting,

480
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
so for me,

481
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
in particular,

482
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
the question on combining public and private efforts,

483
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
so how we can bring together the market,

484
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and the taxpayers in order to support,

485
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
free software ecosystem,

486
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
that's one of the most interesting questions for me,

487
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
because I do believe,

488
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
it should not only be taxpayers money,

489
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
but also private money,

490
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and there,

491
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
it's definitely a question,

492
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
how can we push the market,

493
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
how can we,

494
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
in particular, push those who benefit from,

495
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
feel software,

496
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
but don't contribute back,

497
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
how can we push them,

498
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
and the very interesting part here is,

499
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that we can even combine this,

500
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
we can combine this debate,

501
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
with the cyber resilience act,

502
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
as we dare have these roles of the Stuart and manufacturer,

503
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and we want the manufacturer supporting the Stuart,

504
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
so you can see that we,

505
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
with this topic,

506
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
also,

507
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and using other files to create awareness about this topic,

508
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and this topic of funding is discussed in many debates,

509
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
but it's not that there is,

510
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
this one funding debate happening in Europe,

511
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
at the moment,

512
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
at the moment,

513
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
it's still a lot of peace work,

514
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and I do believe that this,

515
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
that we just address these questions,

516
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
we've already helped us to showcase,

517
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
that there's not this one single question in this,

518
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
niche debate,

519
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
but that there's ongoing overall funding debate,

520
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
which is basically asking for public and private money,

521
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
for innovation,

522
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
for core infrastructure,

523
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and for digital digital sovereignty,

524
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and to come up with one answer to this,

525
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
needs collaboration,

526
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
it needs working together,

527
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and understanding in which niche's people are working on this topic,

528
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
in order to have shared approach,

529
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
so to say,

530
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
to the funding question,

531
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and that we can also use the niche debates

532
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
to show that there are other debates

533
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
ongoing in other files as well.

534
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah,

535
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I would like to pick out the word,

536
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
as you mentioned,

537
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
working together, creating that book,

538
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and also highlight the part

539
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
that we at FSAFE took a lot of time

540
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
to go through all of those talks,

541
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
to like,

542
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
put energy in there and to create those rooms

543
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
for the whole community to network into you,

544
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
get together,

545
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
but we also depend on your support.

546
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So please consider supporting us with the nation,

547
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and you can find information on the FSAFE.org slash donate,

548
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
as we can only continue our work for free software here support.

549
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
This is something that I would like to highlight

550
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
during the context of working,

551
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
because I was just thinking,

552
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
during the whole time I thought,

553
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
oh my god,

554
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Alex has spent a lot of time

555
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and effort to create those rooms,

556
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and I think this is something

557
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
that the whole community benefited by, you know?

558
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I hope so, I hope so, and I had a feeling.

559
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah.

560
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And I also have to add,

561
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
as the normally,

562
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
not only the preparation of the FSAFE,

563
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
it's very time consuming,

564
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
but also the days afterwards,

565
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
or even the weeks afterwards.

566
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So since you normally run into so many people during FSAFE,

567
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and you start so many short chats

568
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
where you agree on,

569
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
oh we need to continue this conversation,

570
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
but it's for them,

571
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
you know, I have to run to the next meeting,

572
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
and you collect even addresses,

573
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
and a lot of things,

574
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and several communication networks,

575
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
and I'm still struggling,

576
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
some may it's that I still have to send.

577
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So it's not only what's happening that day,

578
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
it's one part is the preparation,

579
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
the another part is being there for two days,

580
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
more than nine hours in those deaf rooms,

581
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
without any sunlight.

582
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And then the part which comes afterwards,

583
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
and at one day,

584
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
we will start again preparing the next FSAFE,

585
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
so it's basically FSAFE keeps us busy for the whole year,

586
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
one could say,

587
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and that I can do my work,

588
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
in order to realize these kind of deaf rooms,

589
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
but in order to follow up,

590
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
so it's not just like,

591
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
that we do these deaf rooms for fun.

592
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
We also want to have impact business,

593
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and this needs follow up,

594
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
and this needs a lot of time.

595
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And as said,

596
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
for example, with the funding thing,

597
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
we are just starting,

598
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
to be able to do this,

599
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and I say,

600
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
as a whole community,

601
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and bringing these people together,

602
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
also takes time,

603
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
it needs energy,

604
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
finding common ground,

605
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
see where we can work together,

606
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and this needs a lot of time,

607
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
resources,

608
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and if you donate to us,

609
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
you make this work possible,

610
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
you make our sites for funding possible,

611
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
and then also,

612
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
one day we'll benefit you,

613
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
if you,

614
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
for example,

615
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
a developer,

616
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and maybe we'll get funds for your project in the future.

617
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Perfect.

618
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I would like to take this as a closing word,

619
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
because we,

620
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
exceeded a bit of our time,

621
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
11,

622
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
but I had a very fine chat with you.

623
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Thank you so much,

624
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Alex,

625
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
for making this possible.

626
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Thank you so much for your work,

629
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000

630
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and I really appreciate working with you together,

631
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
