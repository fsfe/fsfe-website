	<h1>EU Declaration of Digital Rights &amp; Principles: Free Software should be included </h1>

	 <p> 
	 On 26 January 2022, the European Commission presented its proposal for 
	 the EU Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles which will serve 
	 as a reference point in the future and as a common EU vision of our 
	 digital rights. The declaration is now being discussed in the European 
	 Parliament and Council, and Free Software should become part of it. 
     </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Built on the Berlin and Tallinn declarations, this proposal aims 
	 to lay the groundwork for a consistent framework that will serve 
	 as a guideline and a reference point for the ongoing and future 
	 digital transformation of Europe. These aforementioned 
	 declarations already refer to Free Software ("Open Source" in 
	 their text) when it comes to digital sovereignty and 
	 interoperability, while they also demand more use of "Open Source" 
	 and strengthening the requirement for its use.

	<p> 
	At the moment, the text of the EU Declaration of Digital Rights and 
	Principles is being discussed in the European Parliament and 
	European Council. The FSFE has been following the process and 
	making sure to share its input and demands so that the wording of 
	the final text is in line with previous frameworks with regard to 
	the use and promotion of Free Software.
	</p>

	 <p>
	 Recently, the JURI and LIBE committees have agreed on including 
	 wording that is aligned with our demands in their amendments to 
	 the text. In Chapter II, covering solidarity and inclusion, the 
	 LIBE Committee has included a reference on the support of "Open 
	 source solutions whenever possible". In Chapter III about freedom 
	 of choice and Chapter IV, called Participation in the digital 
	 public space, the JURI Committee has included also the promotion 
	 of "Open source" standards and a reference to the need of 
	 interoperability and transparency of digital technologies via the 
	 promotion of "Open Source".  
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
	From now on, we will make sure these additions to the text will be 
	defined and clarified, and that they find their way into the final 
	position of the European Parliament. It is important that Free 
	Software becomes part of this declaration because it may guide 
	Europe's digital transformation into an empowering, transparent, 
	and open environment.
	</p>
	  
	 <p>
	 For the last five years, the FSFE  has been advocating for 
	 publicly financed software made publicly available under a Free 
	 Software licence. With its <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public 
	 Money? Public Code!</a> initiative, the FSFE has the goal, among 
	 others, to raise awareness of the benefits that Free Software can 
	 offer such as saving long-term costs, boosting the local economy, 
	 transparency, and more. Including Free Software in the EU 
	 Declaration of Digital Rights and Principles would be an important 
	 milestone for software freedom and for Europe's digital 
	 sovereignty.
