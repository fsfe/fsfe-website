            I have been using free software for years, during the last couple month 
            I started "giving" back, by supporting on forums and writing smaller 
            patches. But I felt like free software deserves some money, too. And 
            the Free Software Foundation is simply the best place for the money to 
            go. I also wanted to show my support for Free Software publicly.
