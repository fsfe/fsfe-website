          are celebrated all around the world, therefore the Vienna Fellowship
          is inviting you to a Software Freedom Party. The evening will be
          opened by a talk about legal aspects in Free Software, held by FSFE's
          new legal coordinator Matija Šuklje. Following this opening everybody
          is invited to have a nice evening at the Metalab with us. <a
