    <h1>No Cloud</h1>

    <div id="introduction">
		<p>
			Many people talk about "the cloud" nowadays. They use that word for all kind of different things: computers ressources sharing, easy backup solution, simple way to share data,... Do you know which one is the good definition? We don't. But still, we put everything in "the cloud": music, videos, documents, private emails,... All our data is available from everywhere we want and that is really useful. But, who is really able to say where is this data now? "On the cloud". Yes, but where is this cloud? Where is <strong>your</strong> data? Who owns it now? The goal of FSFE's no cloud campaign is to give people awareness on this problematic. It's been a long time that we are asking people: who controls the technology you use? Now, with "the cloud", we ask: who controls the technology that controls your data? Who controls your data?
