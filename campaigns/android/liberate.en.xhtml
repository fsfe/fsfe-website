      <h2 id="OS">The Operating Systems</h2>
      
      <p> 
        An operating system is a collection of software that enables you to use
        your phone and run other applications on it. Even though Android is <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html">mostly
        free</a>, many phones ship with proprietary components and add-ons. Some
        phones also have a locked <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting#Boot_loader">boot loader</a>
        which prevents you from booting and installing other operating systems.
        If you want to buy an Android phone, make sure that the boot loader can
        be <a
        href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/?search=&quot;unlock+bootloader&quot;">unlocked</a>.
        On some devices it can only be unlocked with clever hacks
        and their manufacturers tend to declare your warranty void when you unlock their device's boot loader.
        But, given European  Directive 1999/44/CE, just the fact that you modified or changed the software of your device,
        is not a sufficient reason to void your statutory warranty.
        <a href="http://piana.eu/root" title="Does rooting your phone invalidate its warranty?">See Carlo Piana's blog</a> for more information.
        There are
        also companies that ship their devices with an unlocked bootloader or
        provide you with the means to unlock it. Besides that, it is a good idea
        to check if there are free versions of Android <a
        href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices">supporting the device</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="Replicant">Replicant OS</h3>
      
  <div class="image right">
        <img alt="Replicant" src="/campaigns/android/replicant.png" />
      </div>

      <p>
        <a href="http://replicant.us/">Replicant</a> is a distribution of
        Android that is 100% Free Software. It runs only on <a
        href="http://replicant.us/supported-phones/">a very limited number of
        devices</a>. If you have one of these devices, then this is your choice.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="CyanogenMod">CyanogenMod</h3>
      
      <div class="image right">
        <img alt="CyanogenMod" src="/campaigns/android/cyanogenmod.png" />
      </div>
      
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">CyanogenMod</a> is the most
        popular aftermarket distribution for Android. It <a
        href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices">runs on many phones</a> and
        offers <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/about/features">features</a>
        not found in the official Android based firmwares of vendors. It also
        ships without Google applications and gives you more freedom over your
        device. CyanogenMod is Free Software developed by an active community.
        In order to run on so many devices, it makes use of
        <a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_semc_iyokan/blob/gingerbread/proprietary-files.txt">non-free
        device drivers and firmware</a> which are 
        <a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_semc_iyokan/blob/gingerbread/extract-files.sh">fetched
        from a device</a> and are included in the ROM.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In order to install CyanogenMod, your device's boot loader needs to be
        unlocked. The <a
        href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Main_Page">Wiki of
        CyanogenMod</a> contains detailed instructions on how to install it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        After the installation, your phone will be freed from all those
        pre-installed proprietary applications and there will be no need to
        connect your phone with a Google account. With the exception of some
        non-free device drivers, your phone should run only Free Software. If
        you know about non-free software applications added to CyanogenMod, please <a
        href="mailto:android&#64;lists.fsfe.org">let us know</a> about it!
     </p>

	  <p>
	  We collected some information about
	  how you can <a href="/campaigns/android/help.html#OS">help to ensure that CyanogenMod stays free</a>
	  and how to identify and remove non-free parts.
	  </p>


      <h2 id="Apps">The Apps</h2>
      
      <p>
        For most people, the <a href="https://market.android.com/">Google
        Play Store</a> (formerly known as the Android market) is the only or the main source for their
        applications. It doesn't even tell you whether an app is Free Software
        or not, let alone its license. Unfortunately, most apps from this or
        other markets are proprietary. Even if you install a Free Software app,
        there is no reason to trust the downloaded binary. Using the Google
        Market also requires a Google account. It is recommended to not use this
        market at all.
      </p>

      <h3 id="F-Droid">F-Droid</h3>

      <div class="image">
        <img alt="F-Droid" src="/campaigns/android/f-droid.png" />
      </div>

      <p>
        The <a href="http://f-droid.org/">F-Droid initiative</a> was started to
        change the sad Free Software app situation in the Android world. It
        builds a repository of easily-installable Free Software for the Android
        platform. There is an Android client application that makes it easy to
        browse Free Software applications, install them onto your device, and
        keep track of updates. When available it includes information about how
        to donate money to the authors of the app.
      </p>

      <p>
        The F-Droid repository contains details of multiple versions of each
        application. You can also easily create and add own repositories. But
        since the initiative is <a
        href="https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidserver">very active</a>,
        developing in a decentralised fashion and open to collaboration,
        creating own repositories is not really necessary. Its goal is to
        include all useful Free Software Android applications and to keep up
        with their updates.

      <h2 id="Sync">Synchronizing Your Data</h2>

      <p>
        When you run only Free Software and when you do not rely on non-free
        network services like the ones Google offers, it might look like you lose the convenience
        of synchronizing your contacts, your calender and other data with your
        other devices. Fortunately, there is plenty of Free Software that does
        this job as well.
      </p>

      <h3 id="sync-pim">Synchronizing Calendar and Contacts</h3>
      <p>
	      There are several Free Software server implementations of
	      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> and
	      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV">CardDAV</a> that you can use, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://owncloud.org">ownCloud</a>
            &#8212; commercial "key in hand" available at <a href="https://owncloud.com/">ownCloud Inc.</a>
            and other hosting options listed in <a href="http://owncloud.org/providers/">ownCloud supported service providers</a>
		</li>
	    <li>
            <a href="http://kolab.org/">Kolab</a>
            &#8212; commercial "key in hand" available at <a href="https://mykolab.com/">MyKolab</a>;
            information on how to configure client applications available on
            <a href="https://mykolab.com/clients">MyKolab Client Configuration</a> page
        </li>
	    <li>
            <a href="http://www.sogo.nu">SoGO</a>
            &#8212; can replace Microsoft Exchange servers;
            commercial support available at <a href="http://www.sogo.nu/english/support/commercial_support.html">SoGO consulting services</a>;
        </li>
	    <li><a href="http://baikal-server.com">baikal</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://davical.org">DAViCal</a></li>
	    <li>
            <a href="http://davmail.sourceforge.net/">davmail</a>
            &#8212; is not actually a contacts and calendar server,
            but a gateway to Microsoft Exchange servers providing CardDAV and CalDAV access access.
            It might be the first step to liberate your PIM data from proprietary solutions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	      Each of the devices where you would like to have access to your contacts and calendar needs a CardDAV and a CalDAV client.
	      For desktop you can use:
      </p>

      <ul>
	      <li>
            <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird">Thunderbird</a>
            with the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/">Lightening</a> calendar extension
          </li>
	      <li><a href="http://kontact.org">KDE Kontact</a></li>
	      <li><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution">Gnome Evolution</a></li>
	      <li>
            <a href="http://lostpackets.de/pycarddav/">pyCardDAV</a>
            to use CardDAV as a address book in <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">mutt</a>
            (and maybe other email clients) or consulting the CardDAV server from command line.
          </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	      In the Android devices you can use:
      </p>

      <ul>
	      <li>
		      <a href="http://acal.me">ACal</a>
		      (<a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.morphoss.acal">at F-Droid</a>) &#8212;
		      although it doesn't update the Android calendar and contact database it still a very competent PIM application;
	      </li>
	      <li>
		      <a href="http://davdroid.bitfire.at">DAVdroid</a>
		      (<a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=at.bitfire.davdroid">at F-Droid</a>);
	      </li>
	      <li>
		      <a href="https://github.com/gggard/AndroidCaldavSyncAdapater">CalDAV Sync Adapter</a>
		      (<a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.gege.caldavsyncadapter">at F-Droid</a>).
	      </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="sync-files">Synchronizing files</h3>
      <p>
	      To keep files synchronized between devices
      </p>
      <ul>
	      <li>
		      <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/android">ownCloud android client</a>
		      (<a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.owncloud.android">at F-Droid</a>) &#8212;
		      file synchronization and has a instant upload for photos and videos taken using the device;
	      </li>
	      <li>
		      <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Doc:_dropbear">SSH Daemon dropbear</a> &#8212;
		      is pre-installed on CyanogenMod and can be used to e.g. run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>.
	      </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 id="sync-rss">Synchronizing feed readers</h3>
      
      <p>
	      If you usually keep track of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss">RSS</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom</a> feeds,
          then it's nice to be able to keep all devices synchronized. Here are some suggestions of possible free solutions you can use:
      </p>
      <ul>
	      <li>
		      <a href="http://apps.owncloud.com/content/show.php/News?content=158434">ownCloud New Reader</a>
		      (<a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=de.luhmer.owncloudnewsreader">at F-Droid</a>)
	      </li>
	      <li>
		      <a href="http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss">Tiny Tiny RSS</a>
		      (<a href="https://github.com/gothfox/Tiny-Tiny-RSS-for-Honeycomb">source of the official Android client</a>,
              <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.ttrssreader">alternative Android client at F-Droid</a>)
	      </li>
	      <li>

		      (<a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.newsblur">at F-Droid</a>)
	      </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="sync-webbrowser">Synchronizing Web Browsers</h3>
      <p>
	      It's possible to host your own Firefox synchronization server
      </p>
      <ul>
	      <li>deploying your own <a href="http://docs.services.mozilla.com/howtos/run-sync.html">Mozilla Sync Server</a></li>
	      <li>using ownCloud <a href="http://apps.owncloud.com/content/show.php/Mozilla+Sync?content=161793">Mozilla Sync application</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	      It's then possible to use Firefox Web Browser advanced setup of the sync configuration to define the new server and credentials to use.
      </p>
      <p>
	      Although there is some documentation on how to host your own Chrome Web Browser synchronization server,
          it is all very "in the air".
          See <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=181429">issue 181429</a> of the chromium development issue tracker.
