    <body>
      <p>On Sunday, February 14, 2021, the annual "I Love Free Software" day (possibly also known as "Ick lieb' dir, Freie Software" day ;-) will take place! This international day is celebrated every year to thank all the hardworking people who sacrifice their time for us so that we can use cool Free Software. This time we would like to give you the opportunity to present a piece of Free Software that you find useful, beautiful, quirky, special or otherwise interesting. You can find all the details on the event page. We will meet <a href="https://conf.fsfe.org/b/egn-g7l-b5s-ywh">online</a>, on Sunday the 14.02.2021 at 15:00.</p>
