           <h3>Historic documents</h3> 
            <p>These documents are of
            largely historic interest as they tend to contain a lot
            of information that is outdated.</p>
           <ul>
            <li>
              <p><a href="doi.html">Declaration of Intent
              - FSF Europe</a></p>

            <ul><p> This was the first public announcement for the
             Free Software Foundation Europe, launched by the original
             initiators. Its goal was to inform the community about
             their intentions and get in touch with people from other
             countries who might be willing to participate.  It drew
             an amazing amount of interest, has been featured on many
             news-sites and the almost empty web-site had about 15.000
             hits in the first week.</p></ul>
