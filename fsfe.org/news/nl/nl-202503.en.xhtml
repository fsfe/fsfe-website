<h1>Legal Corner+++ FOSDEM recap+++ Ada movie in Spanish</h1>

<p>
In the last few weeks we published our first Legal Corner article and 
the recordings of our talks at FOSDEM. We were happy to see pictures 
from the I Love Free Software Day celebrations and can't wait to meet 
you at CLT 2025! We are organising an online Q&amp;A session about the 
DMA and Free Software. The Ada movie is finally available in Spanish!

<h3 id="dma"><span id="anchor-3"/>Digital Markets Act and Free Software: FOSDEM
keynote, Software Freedom podcast and online Q&amp;A session</h3>
<p>On 24 March 2025, the FSFE is organizing the ‘Online Q&amp;A session
– Digital Markets Act and Free Software: everything the Free Software
community needs to know’. There we will present our efforts to ensure
effective enforcement of the Digital Markets Act, with space for
questions from the Free Software community. More info will be published
soon, stay tuned!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you can watch our colleague Lucas Lasota's <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/bMT2LzSv8QkichHM7eAaXx">keynote speech on
this topic</a> at FOSDEM 2025 under the title “How we are defending
Software Freedom against Apple at the EU's highest court”. Apple is
attempting to avoid obligations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), and
in this talk, we explained why this case is pivotal for Free Software in
Europe and why we should all care.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about Free Software and the DMA, we suggest
that you listen to <a href="/news/podcast/episode-30.html">episode 30 of
our Software Freedom Podcast</a>, where Bonnie Mehring talks with Marc
Prud'hommeaux about the App Fair Project: an alternative iOS marketplace
that exclusively distributes Free Software applications. The project's
goal is to promote a more accessible and inclusive Free Software
ecosystem in iOS.</p>

<h3 id="pmpc"><span id="anchor-4"/>Public Money, Public Code! symposium</h3>
<p>On 8 April 2025, the FSFE is hosting a <a href="/events/events.html#event-20250408-01">symposium
on ‘Public Money? Public Code'</a> in the practical work of public
administrations. One focus will be on the use of Free Software in
municipalities: What can best practices look like and where are local
administrations already leading the way? What opportunities for
collaboration are opened up by Free Software? What challenges arise when
awarding contracts? What opportunities does the use of Free Software
bring for public administrations? </p>
<p>The event will take place in Essen.</p>


<h3 id="legal-corner"><span id="anchor-5"/>Legal Corner: MIA or Dead Contributors - Does It
Matter For Your Software Project?</h3>
<p>If your software project has multiple contributions, and a
contributor becomes uncontactable or passes away, this can become an
issue in certain situations. Here we discuss when a missing or
deceased contributor affects your software project, and what options you
have.</p>
<p><a href="news/2025/news-20250217-01.html">Check out our article on this topic!</a></p>
<p>This is the first article in a new series, "Legal Corner".</p>


<h3 id="ada"><span id="anchor-6"/>From Ada’s Workshop: The Latest on Ada
&amp; Zangemann</h3>
<p>The movie <em>Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream</em> is now <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/mPiL4nzoJ21gWiG4JHLATf">available in
Spanish</a>! Thanks to our donors, and especially Volkswagen Spain, you can now organize screenings
of this inspiring animated story in your community also in Spanish. Help 
us to spread the word about the movie so in the future young people have the 
opportunity to tinker, experiment, and code with Free Software as the 
default.</p>
<p>Prefer a reading instead? The Spanish version of the story is also
available in our <a href="https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/ada-zangemann">Git
repository.</a></p>

Software projects!</p>


<h3 id="fosdem"><span id="anchor-8"/>FOSDEM 2025: Check out the videos from our talks
and listen to our new podcast episode</h3>
<p> Some occasions are too special to miss, like <a href="/news/2025/news-20250220-01.html">our February trip to
FOSDEM</a>, where we connected with the Free Software community. Even when
things didn’t go as planned, it was an energizing boost against the
winter blues. Thanks to everyone who joined our DevRooms, attended our
talks including our keynote on the Apple litigation, came to our women
breakfast, and stopped at the booth.</p>
<p>In our 31st episode of the Software Freedom Podcast, Alexander Sander 
and Bonnie Mehring discuss the highlights of the two Devrooms that the
FSFE co-organized during FOSDEM 2025: the 'Legal and Policy Issues
DevRoom' and the 'Funding the FOSS Ecosystem DevRoom'. <a href="/news/podcast/episode-31.html">Find out more
about the topics discussed there</a> and tips about what to re-watch.</p>


<h3 id="CLT"><span id="anchor-9"/>Chemnitzer Linux-Tage 2025: we will be there!</h3>
<p>Once again, we are participating in the Chemnitzer Linux - Tage that
will take place on Saturday 22 and Sunday 23 March. </p>
<p>
On Saturday at 12:00h., the FSFE's Technical Advisor Florian Snow will 
talk about <a href="https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2025/en/programm/beitrag/273">"Open

11:00h., Johannes Näder (FSFE Senior Policy Project Manager) will <a href="https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2025/en/programm/beitrag/173">shed 
a light on openwashing</a>, the practice of misleading consumers and 
public authorities by disguising proprietary software products as Free 
Software (V7).<br/><br/>"Ada &amp; Zangemann", the story about the girl 
Ada who loves to tinker and bravely stands up to the mighty inventor 
Zangemann, will play a prominent role at this year's CLT: The new 
animated film will be shown on Saturday and Sunday at 14:00 (W1), and a

<h3 id="edulife"><span id="anchor-10"/>Edulife partnership: one more year teaching
Italian students about Free Software</h3>
<p>As part of the FSFE partnership with the Edulife Foundation, Italian
students in the ITS Academy LAST project had the opportunity to learn
about Free Software. During January and February the FSFE provided
educational content covering legal aspects, policy, and public
awareness, helping students gain a deeper understanding of Free Software
and its significance.

<figcaption>Known as the “IT Free Software Knowledge Project”, this two-year partnership
 started in November 2023. As part of this academic program, the
 FSFE delivered educational content about Free Software, with a 
 focus on Free Software legal issues, policy aspects and public awareness
 in the form of lectures. Besides, the students attended Free Software 
 conferences, such as the SFSCon.</figcaption>

<h3 id="community"><span id="anchor-11"/>From our
community</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>There is no cloud, just other people's computers</em>. The Dutch
parliament realized this last year and expressed concern over the reliance
on foreign IT services. In a <a href="https://english.rekenkamer.nl/publications/reports/2025/01/15/dutch-central-government-in-the-cloud">recent
report</a> the Court of Audit concluded that the Dutch central
government started using cloud services without thoroughly considering
the implications and risks. The Netherlands local team, who contributed
to the discussion participating in several meetings as a stakeholder, is
closely following this topic</li>
</ul>
