    <title>The FSFE's information stall at Veganmania in Donauinsel in Vienna, Austria</title>

    <body>
      <p>The Veganmania summer street festivals in Austria are well known and thousands of people are visiting them each year. This is the second Veganmania for this year. Its on the Danube island directly at the city center which is a well known and beloved recreation area. In previous years the festival gave us the opportunity to introduce many people to the Free Software and its philosophical background, as well as give practical advices on how to get and use it. These festivals have been proven to give us much more outreach than any of the Linux weeks events that would normally be the environment for such stalls. And of course it is fun to have such a stall in the middle of stands with many delicious treats.</p>
