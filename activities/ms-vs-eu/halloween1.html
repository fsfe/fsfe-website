	<h1>Halloween Document I (Version 1.14)</h1> *note: some links have died, but have been left so for historical reasons.
	
	<h2>Open Source Software:<br>
	A (New?) Development Methodology</h2>
	
	{ The body of the Halloween Document is an internal strategy memorandum
on Microsoft's possible responses to the Linux/Open Source phenomenon.<P>

(This annotated version has been renamed ``Halloween I''; there's a
sequel, ``<a href="halloween2.html">Halloween II</a>'', which marks up
a second memo more specifically addressing Linux.)<P>

Microsoft has publicly acknowledged that this memorandum is authentic,
but dismissed it as a mere engineering study that does not define
Microsoft policy.<P>

However, the list of collaborators mentioned at the end includes some people
who are known to be key players at Microsoft, and the document reads
as though the research effort had the cooperation of top management;
it may even have been commissioned as a policy white paper for Bill
Gates's attention (the author <a href="#comment6">seems to have
expected</a> that Gates would read it).<P>

Either way, it provides us with a very valuable look past Microsoft's
dismissive marketing spin about Open Source at what the company is
actually thinking -- which, as you'll see, is an odd combination of
astuteness and institutional myopia.<P>

Despite some speculation that this was an intentional leak, this
seems quite unlikely.  The document is too damning; portions could be
considered evidence of anti-competitive practices for the DOJ lawsuit.
Also, the author ``refused to confirm or deny'' when initially
contacted, suggesting that Microsoft didn't have its story worked out
in advance.<P>

Since the author quoted my analyses of open-source community dynamics
(<a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar">The
Cathedral and the Bazaar</a> and <a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/homesteading">Homesteading
the Noosphere</a>) extensively, it seems fair that I should 
respond on behalf of the community. :-)<p>

<B>Key Quotes:</B><P>

Here are some notable quotes from the document, with hotlinks to where
they are embedded.  It's helpful to know that ``OSS'' is the author's
abbreviation for ``Open Source Software''.  FUD, a characteristic
Microsoft tactic, is explained <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hills/9267/fuddef.html">
here</a>.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote1">*</a>
OSS poses a direct, short-term revenue and platform threat to
Microsoft, particularly in server space. Additionally, the
intrinsic parallelism and free idea exchange in OSS has benefits that
are not replicable with our current licensing model and therefore
present a long term developer mindshare threat.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote2">*</a>
Recent case studies (the Internet) provide very dramatic evidence
... that commercial quality can be achieved / exceeded by OSS projects.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote3">*</a>
...to understand how to compete against OSS, we must target a process
rather than a company.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote4">*</a>
OSS is long-term credible ... FUD tactics can not be used to combat it.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote5">*</a>
Linux and other OSS advocates are making a progressively more credible
argument that OSS software is at least as robust -- if not more
-- than commercial alternatives. The Internet provides an ideal,
high-visibility showcase for the OSS world.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote6">*</a>
Linux has been deployed in mission critical, commercial
environments with an excellent pool of public testimonials. ...
Linux outperforms many other UNIXes ... Linux is on track to
eventually own the x86 UNIX market ...
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote7">*</a>
Linux can win as long as services / protocols are commodities.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote9">*</a>
OSS projects have been able to gain a foothold in many server
applications because of the wide utility of highly commoditized,
simple protocols. By extending these protocols and developing new
protocols, we can deny OSS projects entry into the market.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="red">
<a href="#quote8">*</a>
The ability of the OSS process to collect and harness the collective
IQ of thousands of individuals across the Internet is simply
amazing. More importantly, OSS evangelization scales with the size of
the Internet much faster than our own evangelization efforts appear to
scale.

<P>

I've embedded a few other comments in green that aren't associated
with key points and aren't indexed.  These additional comments are
only of interest if you're reading the entire document.<P>

I have otherwise left the document completely as-is (not even
correcting typos), so you can read what Bill Gates is reading about
Open Source.  It's a bit long, but persevere.  An accurate fix on the
opposition's thinking is worth some effort -- and there are one or two
really startling insights buried in the corporatespeak.<P>

<B>Threat Assessment:</B><P>

I believe that far and away the the most dangerous tactic advocated
in this memorandum is that embodied in the sinister phrase ``<FONT
COLOR="red">de-commoditize protocols</FONT>''.<P>

If publication of this document does nothing else, I hope it will
alert everyone to the stifling of competition, the erosion of consumer
choice, the higher costs, and the monopoly lock-in that this tactic
implies. <P>

The parallel with Microsoft's attempted hijacking of Java, and its
attempts to spoil the ``write once, run anywhere'' potential of this
technology, should be obvious.<P>

I have included an <a href="#comment25">extended discussion</a> of this
point in my interlinear comments.  To prevent this tactic from
working, I believe open-source advocates must begin emphasizing these 
points:<P>

<OL>
<LI> Buyers like being in a commodity market.  Sellers dislike it.<P>

<LI> Commodity services and protocols are good for customers; they're
   less expensive, they promote competition, they generate good choices.<P>

<LI> "De-commoditizing" protocols means reducing choice, raising prices,
   and suppressing competition.<P>

<LI> Therefore, for Microsoft to win, <strong>the customer must
     lose</strong>.<P>

<LI> Open source pushes -- indeed <em>relies upon</em> -- commodity services
   and protocols.  It is therefore in harmony with consumer interests.<P>
</OL>

<B>History:</B><P>

The first (1.1) annotated version of the VinodV memorandum was
prepared over the weekend of 31 Oct-1 Nov 1998.  It is in recognition
of the date, and my fond hope that publishing it will help realize
Microsoft's worst nightmares, that I named it the ``Halloween
Document"'.<P>

The 1.2 version featured cleanup of non-ASCII characters.<P>

The 1.3 version noted Microsoft's acknowledgement of authenticity.<P>

The 1.4 version added a bit more analysis and the section on 
Threat Assessment.<P>

The 1.5 version added some bits to the preamble.<P>

The 1.6 version added more to <a href="#comment19">one of the
comments</a>.<P>

The 1.7 version added the reference to the Fuzz papers.<P>

The 1.8 version added a link to the <a href="halloween2.html">Halloween II</a>
document.<P>

The 1.9 version adds a <a href="#comment28">note about HTTP-DAV support</a>.<P>

The 1.10 version adds more on the ``who do you sue?'' question.<P>

The 1.11 version adds perceptive comments from the
<a href="http://www.os2hq.com/archives/linmemo1.htm">Learning From Linux</a>,
page by Tom Nadeau an OS/2 advocate.<P>

The 1.12 version adds illuminating comments by a former Microserf who wishes
to remain nameless.<P>

The 1.13 version adds a comment on ``unsexy'' work based on some
thoughts by Tim Kynerd.<P>

The 1.14 version adds a bit of cleanup.<P>

The 1.15 removed font changes that made the HTML hard to read on large screens.

</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Open Source Software (OSS) is a development process which promotes rapid creation and deployment of incremental features and bug fixes in an existing code / knowledge base.   In recent years, corresponding to the growth of Internet, OSS projects have acquired the depth &amp; complexity traditionally associated with commercial projects such as Operating Systems and mission critical servers.</P>

OK, this establishes that Microsoft isn't asleep at the switch.<p>
TN explains the connection to Java as follows:<br>
Okay, what does this basically mean? Microsoft perceives a product to
be a ``threat'' if it presents itself as any of these:<p>

<OL>
<LI>
a revenue alternative -- somebody might spend money on a non-MS -- product
<LI>
a platform alternative -- MS might lose its monopoly position
<LI>
a developer alternative -- people might actually write software for a
non-MS product.

In their minds, any alternative is a threat. Therefore, freedom of
choice is a source of fear and loathing to MS. The idea that there may
be zero (or negative!) costs with leaving MS and migrating to another
platform scares the daylights out of MS.
}</FONT>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, other OSS process weaknesses provide an
avenue for Microsoft to garner advantage in key feature areas such as
architectural improvements (e.g. storage+), integration
(e.g. schemas), ease-of-use, and organizational support.</P>
<FONT COLOR="green">{
This summary recommendation is mainly interesting for how it fails to
cover the specific suggestions later on in the document about
<A HREF="#decommoditize">de-commoditizing protocols</a> etc.

I'm told by a former Microserf that the references to "Storage+" here
and in the executive summary are much more significant than they
seem. MS's plan for the next few years is to move to an integrated
file/data/storage system based upon Exchange, completely replacing the
current FAT and NTFS file systems. They are absolutely planning on one
monolithic structure, called "megaserver", as their next strategic
infrastructure.  The lock-in effect of this would be immense if they
succeed.

It's interesting to note how differently these last three distinctions
are framed from the way the open-source community generally views
them.<P>

To us, open-source licensing and the rights it grants to users and
third parties are primary, and specific development practice varies
ad-hoc in a way not especially coupled to our license variations.  In
this Microsoft taxonomy, on the other hand, the central distinction is who
has write access to a privileged central code base.<P>

This reflects a much more centralized view of reality, and reflects a
failure of imagination or understanding on the memo-authors's part.
He doesn't grok our distributed-development tradition fully.
This is hardly surprising...

<FONT COLOR="green">{
These sentences, taken together, are rather contradictory unless the
``recent case studies'' are all ``anecdotal''.  But if so, why call them
``very dramatic evidence''?<P>

It appears there's a bit of self-protective backing and filling going
on in the second sentence.  Nevertheless, the first sentence is a huge
concession for Microsoft to make (even internally).<P>

In any case, the `anecdotal' claim is false.  See

Fuzz Revisited: A Re-examination of the Reliability of UNIX
Utilities and Services </a>.<P>

Here are three pertinent lines from this paper:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The failure rate of utilities on the commercial versions of UNIX that
we tested . . .  ranged from 15-43%."  "The failure rate of the
utilities on the freely-distributed Linux version of UNIX was
second-lowest, at 9%."  "The failure rate of the public GNU utilities
was the lowest in our study, at only 7%.<p>

TN remarks:<BR>
Note the clever distinction here (which Eric missed in his
analysis). <FONT COLOR="red>``Commercial quality code''</FONT>
apparently involves <FONT COLOR="red>``customer's eyes''</FONT> (in
Microsoft's own words) rather than any <em>real</em> code quality. In
other words, to Microsoft and the software market in general, a
software product has "commercial quality" if it has the ``look and
feel'' of commercial software products.  A product has commercial
quality code if and only if there is a <em>public perception</em> that
it is made with commercial quality code. This means that MS will take
seriously any product that has an appealing, commercial-looking
appearance because MS assumes -- rightly so -- that this is what the
typical, uninformed consumer uses as the judgment benchmark for what
is ``good code''.<p>

TN is probably right.  This didn't occur to me because, like most
open-source programmers, I consider programs that crash and screw up a
lot to be junk no matter how pretty their interfaces are....<p>

<P>Common Direction</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the communications medium, another set of factors implicitly coordinate the direction of the team. </P>
<P>Common Goals</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Common goals are the equivalent of vision statements which permeate the distributed decision making for the entire development team.

<P>Common Precedents</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Precedence is potentially <U>the most important factor</U> in explaining the rapid and cohesive growth of massive OSS projects such as the Linux Operating System.

At first glance, this just reads like a
brown-nose-Bill comment by someone expecting that Gates will read

More generally, it suggests a serious and potentially exploitable
underestimation of the open-source community's ability to enable its
own visionary leaders.  We didn't get Emacs or Perl or the World Wide
Web from ``20:20 hindsight'' -- nor is it correct to view even
the relatively conservative Linux kernel design as a backward-looking
recreation of past models.<P>
Accordingly, it suggests that Microsoft's response to open source can
be wrong-footed by emphasizing innovation in both our actions and the
way we represent what we're doing to the rest of the world.

Raymond's paper was expressly cited by (then) Netscape CTO Eric Hahn as a motivation for their decision to release browser source code. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Raymond dissected his OSS project in order to derive rules-of-thumb which could be exploited by other OSS projects in the future.  Some of Raymond's rules include:</P>
<P>Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This summarizes one of the core motivations of developers in the OSS process -- solving an immediate problem at hand faced by an individual developer -- this has allowed OSS to evolve complex projects without constant feedback from a marketing / support organization. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT
COLOR="red">This is a classic play out of the Microsoft
handbook.</FONT>   OSS advocates will note, however, that their
release-feedback cycle is potentially an order of magnitude faster
than commercial software's.</P>
<FONT COLOR="green">{
This is an interestingly arrogant
statement, as if they think I was somehow inspired by the Microsoft
way of binary-only releases.<P>

But it suggests something else -- that even though the author
intellectually grasps the importance of source code
releases, he doesn't truly grok how powerful a lever the early
release specifically of <em>source code</em> truly is.
Perhaps living within Microsoft's assumptions makes that impossible.<p>

TN comments:<p>

The difference here is, in every release cycle Microsoft always
listens to its <em>most ignorant customers</em>.  This is the key to
dumbing down each release cycle of software for further assaulting the
non-PC population.  Linux and OS/2 developers, OTOH, tend to listen to
their <em>smartest</em> customers. This necessarily limits the initial appeal
of the operating system, while enhancing its long-term
benefits. Perhaps only a monopolist like Microsoft could get away with
selling worse products each generation -- products focused so narrowly
on the least-technical member of the consumer base that they
necessarily sacrifice technical excellence. Linux and OS/2 tend to
appeal to the customer who knows greatness when he or she sees it.The
good that Microsoft does in bringing computers to the non-users is
outdone by the curse they bring upon the experienced users, because
their monopoly position tends to force everyone toward the
lowest-common-denominator, not just the new users.<p>

<em>Note:</em> This means that Microsoft does the ``heavy lifting'' of
expanding the overall PC marketplace. The great fear at Microsoft is
that somebody will come behind them and make products that not only
are more reliable, faster, and more secure, but are also easy to use,
fun, and make people more productive. That would mean that Microsoft
had merely served as a pioneer and taken all the arrows in the back,
while we who have better products become a second wave to homestead on
Microsoft's tamed territory. Well, sounds like a good idea to me.<p>

So, we ought to take a page from Microsoft's book and listen to the
newbies once in a while. But not so often that we lose our
technological superiority over Microsoft.<p>

ESR again.  I don't agree with TN's apparent assumption that ease-of-use and
technical superiority are <em>necessarily</em> mutually exclusive;
with good design it's possible to do both.  But given limited
resources and poor-to-mediocre design skills, they do tend to get set
in opposition with each other.  Thus there's enough point to TN's
analysis to make it worth reproducing here.

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once a component framework has been established (e.g. key API's &amp; structures defined), OSS projects such as Linux utilize multiple small teams of individuals independently solving particular problems.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because the developers are typically hobbyists, the ability to `fund' multiple, competing efforts is not an issue and the OSS process benefits from the ability to pick the best potential implementation out of the many produced.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note, that this is very dependent on:</P></DIR>

<P><A NAME="_Toc427495725">Parallel Debugging</A></P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The core argument advanced by Eric Raymond is that unlike other aspects of software development, code debugging is an activity whose efficiency improves nearly linearly with the number of individuals tasked with the project.  There are little/no management or coordination costs associated with debugging a piece of open source code -- this is the key `break' in Brooks' laws for OSS.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Raymond includes Linus Torvald's description of the Linux debugging process:</P><DIR>

<P>My original formulation was that every problem ``will be transparent to somebody''. Linus demurred that the person who understands and fixes the problem is not necessarily or even usually the person who first characterizes it. ``Somebody finds the problem,'' he says, ``and somebody else understands it. And I'll go on record as saying that finding it is the bigger challenge.'' But the point is that both things tend to happen quickly</P>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Put alternately:</P><DIR>

<P>``Debugging is parallelizable''. Jeff [Dutky &lt;dutky@wam.umd.edu&gt;] observes that although debugging requires debuggers to communicate with some coordinating developer, it doesn't require significant coordination between debuggers. Thus it doesn't fall prey to the same quadratic complexity and management costs that make adding developers problematic.</P>
</DIR>

<P>One advantage of parallel debugging is that bugs and their fixes are found / propagated much faster than in traditional processes.   For example, when the TearDrop IP attack was first posted to the web, less than 24 hours passed before the Linux community had a working fix available for download.</P>

<P>"Impulse Debugging"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An extension to parallel debugging that I'll add to Raymond's hypothesis is "impulsive debugging".  In the case of the Linux OS, implicit to the act of installing the OS is the act of installing <I>the debugging/development environment.</I>  Consequently, it's highly likely that if a particular user/developer comes across a bug in another individual's component -- and especially if that bug is "shallow" -- that user can very quickly patch the code and, via internet collaboration technologies, propagate that patch very quickly back to the code maintainer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Put another way, OSS processes have a very low entry barrier to the debugging process due to the common development/debugging methodology derived from the GNU tools.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any large scale development process will encounter conflicts which must be resolved.   Often resolution is an arbitrary decision in order to further progress the project.  In commercial teams, the corporate hierarchy + performance review structure solves this problem -- How do OSS teams resolve them?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of Linux, Linus Torvalds is the undisputed `leader' of the project.   He's delegated large components (e.g. networking, device drivers, etc.) to several of his trusted "lieutenants" who further de-facto delegate to a handful of "area" owners (e.g. LAN drivers).</P>

<P>Some very large projects discard the `benevolent dictator' model entirely. One way to do this is turn the co-developers into a voting committee (as with Apache).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is basically a rephrasing of Raymond's first rule of thumb -- "Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many OSS projects -- such as Apache -- started as a small team of developers setting out to solve an immediate problem at hand.

<P>Education</P>

"Homesteading on the Noosphere" (<a

acquiring property by being the first to `discover' it or by being the

Note the terminology used here ``driven out of business''. MS believes
that putting other companies out of business is not merely ``collateral
damage'' -- a byproduct of selling better stuff -- but rather, a direct
business goal. To put this in perspective, economic theory and the
typical honest, customer-oriented businessperson will think of
business as a stock-car race -- the fastest car with the most skillful
driver wins. Microsoft views business as a demolition derby -- you
knock out as many competitors as possible, and try to maneuver things
so that your competitors wipe each other out and thereby eliminate
themselves. In a stock car race there are many finishers and thus many
drivers get a paycheck. In a demolition derby there is just one
survivor. Can you see why ``Microsoft'' and ``freedom of choice'' are

Whether it's really true that most developers prefer the `trust' model
or not is an extremely interesting question.<P>

Twenty years of experience in the field tells me not; that, in

obviously, wants to believe that its `organizational credibility'
counts -- I detect some wishful thinking here.<P>

On the other hand, they may be right.  We in the open-source community
can't afford to dismiss that possibility.  I think we can meet it by
developing high-quality documentation.  In this way, `trust' in name
authors (or in publishers of good repute such as O'Reilly or
Addison-Wesley) can substitute for `trust' in an API-defining

Nonsense.  In the open-source world, all it takes is one person with a

Part of the point of open source is to lower the energy barriers that

In the open-source world, innovators get to try anything, and the only
test is whether users will volunteer to experiment with the innovation

Characterizing this kind of work as ``unsexy'' reveals an interesting
blind spot.  It has been my experience that for almost any kind of work,
there will be somebody, somewhere, who thinks it's interesting or
fulfilling enough to undertake it.<p>
  
Take the example of Unicode support above.  Who's likely to do the best,

three people?<p>

It's likely to be either Ana or Jeff (all else, including skill sets,

A former Microserf tells me that `throw one away' is actually pretty
close to a defined Microsoft policy, but one designed to leverage
marketing rather than fix problems. The project he was involved with
involved a web-based front-end to Exchange. The resulting first draft
(after 14 months of effort) was completely inferior to already
existing free-web-email (Yahoo, Hotmail, etc). The official response
to that was ``<Shrug> That's ok. We'll get the market share and fix
the technical problems over the next 3-4 years''.<P>

He adds: Internet Explorer 5, just before one of its beta releases had
about 300K (yes, 300K) outstanding bugs targeted to be fixed before
the beta release. Much of this was accomplished by simply removing
large chunks of planned (new) functionality and pushing them to a
later (+1-2 years later) release.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key thread here is that because OSS doesn't have an explicit marketing / customer feedback component, wishlists -- and consequently feature development -- are dominated by the most technically savvy users.</P>
<A NAME="comment16">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR="red">One thing that development groups at MSFT
have learned time and time again is that ease of use, UI
intuitiveness, etc. must be built from the ground up into a product
and can not be pasted on at a later time.</FONT></P>
<FONT COLOR="green">{
This demands comment -- because it's so right in theory, but so hideously
wrong in Microsoft practice.  The wrongness implies an exploitable
weakness in the implied strategy (for Microsoft) of emphasizing UI.<P>

There are two ways to build in ease of use "from the ground up".  One
(the Microsoft way) is to design monolithic applications that are
defined and dominated by their UIs.  This tends to produce
``Windowsitis'' -- rigid, clunky, bug-prone monstrosities that are all
glossy surface with a hollow interior. <P>

Programs built this way <em>look</em> user-friendly at first sight,
but turn out to be huge time and energy sinks in the longer term.
They can only be sustained by carpet-bomb marketing, the main purpose
of which is to delude users into believing that (a) bugs are features,
or that (b) all bugs are really the stupid user's fault, or that (c)
all bugs will be abolished if the user bends over for the next
upgrade. This approach is fundamentally broken.<P>

The other way is the Unix/Internet/Web way, which is to separate the
engine (which does the work) from the UI (which does the viewing and
control).  This approach requires that the engine and UI communicate
using a well-defined protocol.  It's exemplified by browser/server
pairs -- the engine specializes in being an engine, and the UI
specializes in being a UI.<P>

With this second approach, overall complexity goes down and
reliability goes up.  Further, the interface is easier to
evolve/improve/customize, precisely because it's not tightly
coupled to the engine.  It's even possible to have multiple 
interfaces tuned to different audiences.<P>

Finally, this architecture leads naturally to applications that are
enterprise-ready -- that can be used or administered remotely from the
server.  This approach works -- and it's the open-source community's
natural way to counter Microsoft.<P>

The key point is here is that if Microsoft wants to fight the
open-source community on UI, let them -- because we can win that
battle, too, fighting it our way.  They can write ever-more-elaborate
Windows monoliths that spot-weld you to your application-server
console.  We'll win if we write clean distributed applications that
leverage the Internet and the Web and make the UI a
pluggable/unpluggable user choice that can evolve.<P>

Note, however, that our win depends on the existence of well-defined
protocols (such as HTTP) to communicate between UIs and engines.
That's why the stuff later in this memo about ``de-commoditizing
protocols'' is so sinister.  We need to guard against that.

The vagueness of this last sentence is telling.  Had the author
continued, he would have had to acknowledge that Apache is clobbering
the crap out of IIS in the marketplace (Apache's share 54% and
climbing; IIS's somewhere around 14% and dropping).<P>

This would have led to a choice of unpalatable (for Microsoft)
alternatives.  It may be that Apache's informal user-support channels and
`organizational credibility' actually produce better results than
Microsoft's IIS organization can offer.  If that's true, then it's hard to
see in principle why the same shouldn't be true of other open-source
projects.<P>

The alternative -- that Apache is so good that it doesn't <em>need</em>
much support or `organizational credibility' -- is even worse.  That
would mean that all of Microsoft's heavy-duty support and marketing
battalions were just a huge malinvestment, like crumbling Stalinist
apartment blocks forty years later.<P>

These two possible explanations imply distinct but parallel strategies
for open-source advocates.  One is to build software that's so good it
just doesn't need much support (but we'd do this anyway, and generally
have).  The other is to do more intensely what we're already doing
along the lines of support mailing lists, newsgroups, FAQs, and other
informal but extremely effective channels.

A former Microserf adds: As of NT5 (sorry, Win2K :-) MS is going to
claim a huge increase in IIS market share. This is because IIS5 is
built directly linked with the NT kernel and handles all external TCP
traffic (mail, http, etc). MSOffice is also going to communicate
through IIS when talking with NT or Exchange, thus allowing them to
add all internal LAN traffic to their usage reports. Let's see if we
can pop their balloon before they raise it.

No.  In the open-source community, new features are driven by the

<FONT COLOR="green">{
The easy and obvious counter to this is to observe that
Microsoft is pretty bad at `end-to-end ease of use' itself; what
it's good at is creating systems that <em>look at first sight</em>
as though they have that quality, but don't actually deliver on it
(and, over time, have a far higher total cost in productivity lost
to bugs and missing features than does Linux).<P>

Though this is true, it evades an important issue -- which is
that Microsoft's own meretriciousness on this score doesn't make its
criticism any less valid.  Open-source development really is
poor at addressing this class of issues, because it doesn't involve
systematic ease-of-use-testing with non-hackers.<P>

This genuinely will slow down Linux's advance on the desktop.  It is
not likely to stall it forever, however -- not if efforts like <a

There's a hidden presumption here that innovation and ``first mover advantage''
are the only ways to defray the perceived cost of switching.  This is
a dangerous assumption for Microsoft; it may be that the superior
reliability and stability of Linux is sufficient.<P>

Even granting the author's presumption, the possibility that Linux can
grab a sufficient `first-mover' advantage is not safely foreclosed
unless the open-source mode really is incapable of generating 
innovation -- and we already know that's not true.

<FONT COLOR="green">{
Here, as in the earlier comment on <a href="#comment21">how Linux
can win</a>, we start to see the actual outlines of a Microsoft
strategy emerge from the fog of corporatese.  And it ain't pretty; in
fact, it's ugly enough to make it appropriate that it's pushing
midnight on Halloween as I write.<P>

What the author is driving at is nothing less than trying to subvert
the entire "<FONT COLOR="red">commodity network and server</FONT>"
infrastructure (featuring TCP/IP, SMTP, HTTP, POP3, IMAP, NFS, and
other open standards) into using protocols which, though they might
have the same names, have actually been subverted into customer- and
market-control devices for Microsoft (this is what the author really
means when he exhorts Microserfs to ``<FONT COLOR="red">raise the bar
&amp; change the rules of the game</FONT>'').<P>

The `<FONT COLOR="red">folding extended functionality</FONT>' here is
a euphemism for introducing nonstandard extensions (or entire
alternative protocols) which are then saturation-marketed as
standards, even though they're closed, undocumented or just specified
enough to create an illusion of openness.  The objective is to make
the new protocols a checklist item for gullible corporate buyers,
while simultaneously making the writing of third-party symbiotes for
Microsoft programs next to impossible.  (And anyone who succeeds gets
bought out.)<P>

This game is called ``embrace and extend''.  We've seen Microsoft play
this game before, and they're very good at it.  When it works,
Microsoft wins a monopoly lock.  Customers lose.<P>

(This standards-pollution strategy is perfectly in line with 
Microsoft's efforts to corrupt Java and break the Java brand.)<P>

Open-source advocates can counter by pointing out exactly how and 
why customers lose (reduced competition, higher costs, lower
reliability, lost opportunities).  Open-source advocates can also make
this case by showing the contrapositive -- that is, how open source and
open standards increase vendor competition, decrease costs, improve
reliability, and create opportunities.<P>

Once again, as Microsoft conceded <a href="#comment3">earlier in the
memo</a>, the Internet is our poster child.  Our best stop-thrust
against embrace-and-extend is to point out that Microsoft is trying
to close up the Internet.

However, development of that httpd had stalled after mid-1994, and many webmasters had developed their own extensions and bug fixes that were in need of a common distribution. A small group of these webmasters, contacted via private e-mail, gathered together for the purpose of coordinating their changes (in the form of "patches"). By the end of February `95, eight core contributors formed the foundation of the original Apache Group.   In April 1995, Apache 0.6.2 was released.</P>

<P>During May-June 1995, a new server architecture (code-named Shambhala) was developed which included a modular structure and API for better extensibility, pool-based memory allocation, and an adaptive pre-forking process model.

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Provide more extensibility </B>-- The Linux "enthusiast developer" loves writing to  / understanding undocumented API's and internals.

<FONT COLOR="green">{
How curious.  This paragraph only makes sense if Microsoft has
"undocumented internal APIs" to document.  Didn't Microsoft executives
testifying in a federal restraint-of-trade lawsuit deny this under
oath in 1995?  I wonder if perjury charges might be in order...

A former Microserf tells me that Microsoft departments see themselves
almost as separate organizations. Parallel (and competitive) software
development spurs both groups onward. The 'surviving' product is then
what MS releases.  This internal adversarial approach is taken so far
that many crucial components do not have documented APIs -- primarily
to ensure that the Dev team is not broken up and moved to other
projects.  MS is protected against perjury charges by the simple fact
that their APIs are not even documented for internal MS use, so they
are not holding anything back from competitors.

How can we create social structures that provide network benefits leveraging this huge developer base?

A former Microserf adds: only half of the reason MS sends people to
the W3C working groups relates to a desire to improve RFC
standards. The other half is to give MS a sneak peak at upcoming
standards so they can "extend" them in advance and claim that the
`official' standard is `obsolete' when it emerges around the same time
as their `extension'.<P>

Once again, open-source advocates' best response is to point out to
customers that when things are ``de-commoditized'', vendors gain and
customers lose.
