<h1>The FSFE demands EU Commission sustainable long-term Free Software funding</h1>

<p>In the wake of the recent €27 million cut in  the NGI funding, the 
Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is responding to growing 
concern by participating in a  public consultation of the European 
Commission. The FSFE is stressing the urgent need for sustainable, 
long-term financial support for Free Software to ensure Europe's 
technological independence.</p>

<p>The recent <a href="/news/2024/news-20240719-01.html">cut of €27 million allocated to funding for the Next 
Generation Internet initiative</a> has exposed the 
fragility of financial support for software freedom as a whole, and 
highlighted a critical issue: Europe needs sustainable, secure, and 
dedicated funding to ensure its control over technology through Free 
Software. Much of Europe's digital infrastructure <a 
href="https://www.ngi.eu/news/2024/07/11/ngi-impact-study/">relies on 
these 
projects</a> to ensure independence and resilience. Reducing or cutting 
funding threatens Europe’s technological autonomy.</p>
 
<p>In response to the <a href="/news/2024/news-20240808-01.html">European Commission's unclear stance</a> 
on future funding, the FSFE has participated in the public consultation, pushing to ensure 
that Free Software solutions receive the necessary long-term funding. 
This is the only way to successfully drive the digitalisation of Europe 
forward.</p>

<p> </p>
<blockquote>“The EU’s digital strategy can only reach its full 
potential if it systematically focuses on Free Software,” Alexander 
Sander,  FSFE senior policy consultant, emphasizes. "We demand that 
public funds are allocated efficiently. Software freedom must be 
consistently supported with sustainable, long-term funding.  After all, 
if it’s public money, it should be public code!".</blockquote> <p></p>
