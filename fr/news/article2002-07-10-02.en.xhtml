	<p>
	  Lecture of 10 July 2002 at <a
	  href="http://lsm.abul.org/">LSM</a> by Ismael Olea about the
	  concept of libre publisher: publishing services for libre
	  documentation.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Yesterday I talked about the problems of free
	  documentation. My experience working in LDP allowed
	  me to identify them and try to find solutions.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I learned about editing books in classic ways. It 
	  offers many solutions to our problems. Electronic
	  books are different but the process is exactly the
	  same and we can reuse the methodology and we can
	  improve our librarian work.
	</p>

	<p>
	  We depend on volunteers, this is a difference. But
	  most of the problems we face in electronic edition
	  are the same. 
	</p>

	<p>
	  Necessity to define an editorial plan. I have books
	  here explaining how to do that in the traditional 
	  publishing world. We just have to learn about it,
	  there is no need to re-invent it.
	</p>

	<p>
	  We need linguistic tools. People need to proofread,
	  tools can fix spelling mistakes etc.
	</p>

	<p>
	  We need to learn typography. How to cut paragraphs, 
	  when using quotes or double quotes etc. And there are
	  differences when switching to a foreign langage.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Different documentation projects have more similarities than
	  differences. Therefore we can share most of the resources
	  and they should be merged. There should be a common
	  framework in order to maintain a quality process.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Loïc Dachary: how can you convince projects to merge ?
	</p>

	<p>
	  This is already happening in many documentation projects. 
	</p>

	<p>
	  Back to the main topic. Many volunteers need to learn and we
	  must smooth the learning curve. We should contact linguists
	  in universities in order to complete our tools and help them
	  with our work. Universities and documentation projects
	  synergies must increase.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Now more about the editorial plan. I was very much inspired
	  from a spanish book. There is the Author, the Editor, the
	  Book and the Reader. The Author creates, the Editor
	  reproduces, the Book is published and finally the Reader 
	  consumes it.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The reproduction stage (editing) is not trivial. We have
	  a lot of filters we need to remove the useless formats. We
	  are more interested in HTML, PDF etc. Less interested in 
	  dvi, for instance.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The various roles of people define the configuration of
	  the working groups. When we define the work that is expected
	  for a given role, it makes it a lot easier. 
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Editor</li>
	  <li>Authors</li>
	  <li>Proofreaders</li>
	  <li>Printers</li>
	  <li>Librarians</li>
	  <li>Graphics</li>
	  <li>Web authors</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  The quality process need to define the points that need
	  to be checked to ensure that the produced document is
	  of acceptable quality.
	</p>

	<p>
	  We define conventions to classify documents. For instance
	  reference, guides, howto etc. For each of them we need
	  a specific software configuration. By merging all the 
	  documentations we create an encyclopedia and define what
	  kind of manuals are needed. For instance Apache has a need
	  for a FAQ, a reference and a guide. That's not what happens
	  sometime. We see HOWTO that really are reference manuals.
	</p>

	<p>
	  At the end we want to have a well organized library.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Teaching the volunteers. They are not ready to use
	  all the tools and not ready to learn everything about
	  publishing. We need to explain them how to do things
	  properly in a very short time. This is the goal of the
	  tutorial.
	</p>

	<p>
	  A first and important thing is to establish a "love"
	  relationship with volunteers. They need to feel at home.
	</p>

	<p>
	  For collaborative work we need a SourceForge like
	  platform. For instance for printing services, electronic
	  publication, bug tracking, helping the edition process.
	  We also need dictionnaries, thesaurus, glossaries etc.
	</p>
