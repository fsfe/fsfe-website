        "Spectacular! I liked it a lot, the translation is exquisite, the illustration is unbeatable and the message is clear and beautiful. It expresses very well the fundamental values of Free Software, sharing knowledge and free access to it. Zangemann symbolizes very well the limitations of technology and Ada is 'us', learning and understanding how things go and wanting to help others with what we know. Very inspiring."
