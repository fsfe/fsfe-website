  hardware and software, and in the process realises how crucial it is 
  for her and others to control technology.

 <blockquote>
    
  <p>“Introduces readers young and old to the power and peril of 
  software. Behind it all is a backdrop of ethics of knowledge sharing 
  upon which the arc of human history rides.” - <em>Vint Cerf, Computer 
  Scientist and One of the Inventors of the Internet</em></p>

  <p>“What a fun read! I recognize myself in Ada at many moments.” 
  - <em>Isabela Fernandes, Executive Director, The Tor project</em></p>

  <p>“A rousing tale of self-reliance, community, and standing up to 
  bullies...software freedom is human freedom!” 
  - <em>Cory Doctorow, Sci-Fi Author</em></p>
  
  <p>“Even as a non-child, I was captivated by the story from the first 
  page to the last. Kudos to the author for packaging difficult topics 
  such as monopolies, lobbyism, digital divide, software freedom, 
  digital autonomy, IoT, consumer control, e-waste and much more in a 
  child-friendly form in an easily understandable and exciting 
  storyline” - <em>Jörg Luther, chief editor of the German Linux-Magazin, 
  LinuxUser, Raspberry Pi Geek </em></p>
