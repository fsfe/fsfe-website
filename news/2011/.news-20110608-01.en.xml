  <h1>FSFE celebrates World IPv6 Day</h1>


  <p>On today's World IPv6 Day, FSFE is pleased to announce
        that almost all of its servers are now reachable via IPv6.</p>

  <p>"Enabling IPv6 on our servers was easier than we initially
        imagined," says FSFE system administrator Stefan
        Harmuth. "We hope that IPv6 adoption will be a lot quicker
        once everyone realises how easy it is."</p>

  <p> "Given FSFE's long-term perspective, it's only logical for us
        to lead on IPv6 adoption, doing our bit to make sure that
        there will be enough addresses to go around in days to come", says
        Karsten Gerloff, FSFE's president.</p>

  <p>FSFE started implementing IPv6 on its systems in
        February 2010. We are grateful to our sponsor OpenIT in DÃ¼sseldorf,
        Germany, for their continued support and their great IPv6
        delivery.</p>
