  <h1>Dutch government formation: Open letter on Free Software and Public
Money? Public Code!</h1>

  <p> The Dutch government is about to form itself and setting up goals for
the next term. With an Open Letter FSFE urges the coalition parties to
implement the 'open, unless' policy of 2020 and thus the principle of
Public Money? Public Code!</p> 


<p>
Free Software gives everybody the right to use, study, share and improve
software. This right helps support other fundamental freedoms like
freedom of speech, press and privacy. If the principle of Public Money?
Public Code! is implemented government improves the transparency and
digital sovereignty. Also it will help educational institutions with
digital skills, information literacy and improving the privacy of pupils
and staff. At the same time it will stimulate IT market and thus other
markets like labour market. Due to open code, cooperation with
governments at home and abroad is stimulated.
</p>

<p>First attempts to promote Free Software among public bodies, like the
'open, unless' policy of 2020, need to be followed, implemented and
extended. We urge for legislation requiring that publicly financed
software developed for the public sector be made publicly available
under a Free Software licence licence. Code paid by the people should be
available to the people!</p>
