    <body>
      October marked the beginning of a planning phase in FSFE.  As
      well as planning our campaigns for next year, we've been working
      on some actions for around the upcoming festive season.
      Alongside the internal discussions, we've been asking the
      community for ideas when we go to events or hold Fellowship
      meetings.
