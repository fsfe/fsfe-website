        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement">ACTA</a>
        is an international agreement on copyright and patents which
        several developed countries are currently negotiating in secret.
        While no official texts have been published, numerous leaked
        documents indicate that the treaty would further restrict our
        freedom to share and re-use knowledge.  The European
        Commission's DG TRADE is holding a stakeholders' consultation
        meeting to inform Europeans about the state of play of the
        negotiations.  FSFE's President Karsten Gerloff will attend the
        meeting and represent the interests of Free Software.

        The event is open to the public, but registration is required.
        The European Commission promises to make a web stream of the
        event available.
