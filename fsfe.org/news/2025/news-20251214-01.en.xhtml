	<h1>Wrapping Up the Year With Free Software at the 39C3</h1>

	<p>Once again, the FSFE is heading to the Chaos Communication Congress!
	From 27 until the 30 December, we will be back in Hamburg as part of the
	Bits &amp; Bäume assembly. Over 12.000 people will join us to
	participate in this community event, full of great talks, workshops and
	creatures from all over the world. Swing by, say hi, and warm up with
	some Free Software vibes!</p>

	<p>As the Christmas markets wind down, the Hamburg Congress Center
	begins to transform. People arrive from all directions; spaceships and
	blinking lights appear; hackerspaces from across Europe start setting up
	their assemblies. Civil society groups gather to showcase their work and
	their hopes for the future, while art installations rise piece by piece.
	A low murmur fills the CCH, one that is growing louder and more vibrant
	by the minute: an unmistakable sign that the Chaos Communication
	Congress is coming back to life.</p>

	<p>The 39th edition of this well-known event will once again take over
	Hamburg from December 27 to 30, filling the post-Christmas lull with
	creativity, tech, activism, and a whole lot of interesting people. This
	conference, organised by and for the community, brings together around
	12,000 participants each year, people who do not want to miss the chance
	to be part of this utopic and ever-evolving event full of community,
	curiosity, and digital freedom. For four days, the CCH becomes a
	temporary city: a place where bold ideas are built overnight and where
	the boundaries of technology, art, and society are constantly being
	pushed and reimagined.</p>

	<p>You will find the FSFE crew <a 
	href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/assembly/detail/bitsundbaeume_aboutfreedom">at 
	the Bits &amp; Bäume assembly</a> with a
	booth with stickers and merchandise, as well as a full program
	presenting our 2048 vision: a future in which everyone has the right to
	remove and install any software on any of their devices, all public
	funding for software is dedicated exclusively to Free Software,
	regulatory frameworks actively encourage the use and development of Free
	Software, licensing and legal decisions are grounded in facts rather
	than fear, uncertainty, and doubt, and young people can tinker,
	experiment, and learn to code with Free Software as the default. Come
	by, meet us, and help us turn this vision into reality.</p>
	<p>Of course, we will not be alone: plenty of other Bits &amp; Bäume
	organisations will be right around us, bringing brilliant talks, fun
	workshops, and lively booths. And do not forget the hackerspaces and the
	official program! With so many exciting things happening around the
	clock for four full days, the real challenge will be choosing where to
	go next.</p>

	<p>So, <a href="/events/index.html#event-20251227-01">what to expect 
	from the FSFE at 39C3?</a> We are planning to have a
	dedicated FSFE contributors and volunteers meeting, <a 
	href="http://ada.fsfe.org/">“Ada &amp; Zangemann”</a> reading, hands-on 
	workshops about
	<a href="http://reuse.software">REUSE</a> and about running an 
	organisation with Free Software, a deep dive
	into <a href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index.html">Device 
	Neutrality</a> and the <a 
	href="/activities/apple-litigation/apple-litigation.html">Apple v. EU 
	litigation</a>, and of course we
	will be answering your questions about our Vision 2048 and current
	activities such as <a href="http://yh4f.org/">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</a>, which is open for
	registration and will start directly after the 39C3 is over.</p>

	<p>But, most importantly bring your instruments and yourself to our
	booth for our daily 19:00h Free Software sing-along. So, stop by, warm
	up, say hello, and share some Free Software holiday cheer with us. </p>
	<p>
	We are looking forward to seeing you at <a 
	href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/infos/startpage.html">39C3!</a>
