    <h1>Overview of website features</h1>

    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
        This page shows various features that the fsfe.org website provides for
        editors. It is far from complete and always work in progress, just like
        the website in general. And hey, already this paragraph is a special
        feature, the <code>&lt;div id="introduction"&gt;</code>.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="toc float-right">
      <p>Table of contents</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="#metadata">Meta data</a></li>
        <li><a href="#links">Links</a></li>
        <li><a href="#emails">Emails</a></li>

      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you would like to follow how the features are actually being used, make
      sure to have a look at the source code of this page. You will find a link
      <a href="#page-info">in the footer</a>, as on every page.
    </p>

    <p>
      First of all, when editing or creating websites, please make sure to <a
      href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/TechDocs/Mainpage/Editing#Enabling_Git_hooks">enable
      the Git hooks</a> and follow <a
      href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/TechDocs/Mainpage/Editing/BestPractices">the
      best practices</a>. They will mitigate a lot of common issues and make
      things more pleasant for you and others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Secondly, be aware that not all features work on all pages. News items and
      events have some limitations or extra features. Some things are only
      possible when you have set <code>&lt;body class="article"&gt;</code> (like
      the sidebar), while <code>&lt;body class="overview"&gt;</code> is a
      full-width page with other benefits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thirdly, also be aware of the more technical documentation of the features
      <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/TechDocs/Mainpage/Editing">on the Editing
      wiki page</a>. While the page you are currently looking at is rather meant
      for editors, the wiki page may be more helpful for our tech-savvy web
      developers.
    </p>


    <h2 id="metadata">Meta data</h2>

    <p>
      You can add various meta data and clever tags in your XHTML file. <a
      href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/TechDocs/Mainpage/Editing#Adding_meta_information">This
      wiki page</a> shows all of them. In this article, we set multiple authors
      (see on top) and a description and image that are visible in social media
      and other pages.
    </p>

    <h2 id="links">Links</h2>

    <p>
      Linking to websites using <code>&lt;a href="https://example.com"&gt;click
      me&lt;/a&gt;</code> is the 101 of HTML. However, there are a few neat
      tricks you should know of.
    </p>

    <h3 id="anchor-links">Anchor links</h3>

    <p>
      You can not only link to separate website, but also to parts of your page.
      This can be done with anchor links. To achieve this, you'll first need to
      mark the portion of the website that you would like to link to. In most
      cases, this should be done by marking a headline. A use-case could be a
      table of contents.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example, we gave the headline above this section ("Anchor links")
      an id: <code>&lt;h3 id="anchor-links"&gt;Anchor links&lt;/h3&gt;</code>.
      From now on, we can link to the id "anchor-links".
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to link to a section of the <em>same</em> site, you need to
      prepend the link with a "#". So <a href="#anchor-links">this link</a> is
      just <code>href="#anchor-links"</code>. However, you can also from another
      site link to this specific section. Such a link could look like this:
      <code>&lt;a
      href="https://fsfe.org/contribute/web/features.html#anchor-links"&gt;click
      me&lt;/a&gt;</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>NOTE</strong>: if you do not add an <code>id</code> attribute to
      headlines, our build system will automatically do so, starting with
      <code>id-</code> and then followed with the name of the headline (and some
      modification). However, you are discouraged from using this effectively,
      because this id will not be the same if the article is translated. So if
      you link to a headline having the content "Important Section" via the
      automatically generated anchor link <code>#id-important-section</code>,
      this link will not work in the Italian translation where the automatically
      generated id of the headline will be <code>id-sezione-importante</code> or
      so.
    </p>

    <h3>Donation links</h3>

    <p>
      A special feature of our website is the automatic setting of a donation
      link. Let's say you write a news item and would like to motivate people to
      become supporters or make a one-time donation. You could just directly
      link to the <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">donation page</a>, but
      ideally you want to learn which article motivated people to contribute.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this, you can just use <code>fsfe-cd-donate-link</code>. Instead of
      doing <code>&lt;a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate"&gt;help
      us&lt;/a&gt;</code>, you can do: <code>&lt;fsfe-cd-donate-link&gt;help
      us&lt;/fsfe-cd-donate-link&gt;</code>. This automatically sets a referrer
      to the donation link. The even cooler thing: it also works with buttons or
      anything else that you do with <code>a</code> tags:
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        We center the button by adding the <code>text-center</code> class to the
        surrounding paragraph element. A button in this context is not more than
        a style piece of text.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p class="text-center">
      <fsfe-cd-donate-link class="btn btn-lg btn-primary">
        Donate to the FSFE
      </fsfe-cd-donate-link>
    </p>

    <p>
      To learn more about buttons, click <a href="#buttons">here</a>.
    </p>


    <h2 id="emails">Emails</h2>

    <p>
      It is common to include email addresses in your text, e.g. if your would
      like to get direct feedback on a topic. Unfortunately, this will make the
      posted email address likely to receive a lot of spam because bots are
      crawling all kinds of websites to get email addresses they could spam.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our system supports some basic ways how to prevent that and still be
      accessible to people using a screen reader. To just show an email address
      safely (like <email>donotmailme@fsfe.org</email>), do it like
      <code>&lt;email&gt;donotmailme@fsfe.org&lt;/email&gt;</code>. If you want
      that people can just click on the link to have their email application
      opened with the mail as recipient (like <email
      mailto="yes">donotmailme@fsfe.org</email>), make it <code>&lt;email
      mailto="yes"&gt;donotmailme@fsfe.org&lt;/email&gt;</code>.
    </p>


    <h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>

    <p>
      Including nice graphics is one of the most important steps to make a page
      attractive to readers. Therefore, we support many ways how to embed
      graphics, position them neatly, and fit them to your content. Let's have a
      look at the default way how to include a picture: (almost) full-size,
      shadow around it, and a caption below:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="/graphics/group-blur-800.jpg" alt="A random group picture" />
      <figcaption>
        A picture of a group, somewhen in 2013
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The code for that would be the following (the next examples won't have
      this explicit code display, so have a look at the source code then):
    </p>

    <pre><code>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="/graphics/group-blur-800.jpg" alt="A random group picture" /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A picture of a group, somewhen in 2013
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</code></pre>

    <aside>
      <p>
        Applying multiple classes to one element is no problem. Just separate
        them with a space, e.g. <code>&lt;figure class="float-right
        no-border"&gt;</code>
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      You can equip the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element with many more
      classes to adapt them to your needs. Here are some examples:
    </p>

    <figure class="float-right">
      <a href="#graphics">
        <img src="/graphics/group-blur-800.jpg" alt="A random group picture" />
      </a>
    </figure>

    <p>
      On the right, we have a <code>class="float-right"</code>, and this time
      without a <code>figcaption</code>. On large screens, it will stick to the
      right, on small ones it will become full-width to stay visible for
      visitors. Of course, <code>float-left</code> is also possible. We have
      also wrapped the image in a link (using the <code>a</code> element), so
      people can click on it. Links should be used wisely as they direct your
      readers away from the current page.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also control the width of the image freely. Add the
      <code>max-width-XX</code> class to the figure, where XX equals a number
      between 0 and 100 in steps of 5. In the example below, we set it to 55,
      and apply a few other classes:
    </p>

    <figure class="max-width-55 no-border">
      <img src="/graphics/group-blur-800.jpg" alt="A random group picture" />
      <figcaption class="text-right">
        This description is right-aligned, why ever...
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Did you notice that the shadow around the picture is gone?
      <code>no-border</code> sets that. And for some reason, we defined that the
      text in the figcaption shall be aligned to the right, by applying the
      <code>text-right</code> class.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>BE AWARE</strong>: although we have all these classes, please
      don't overuse them. We strive to keep a more or less uniform style on
      fsfe.org. Therefore, try to be consistent with other, similar pages, and
      don't make your page a playground for wild styling experiments.
    </p>


    <h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>

    <p>
      Videos work similarly to <a href="#graphics">graphics</a>, but are a bit
      more complex. As graphics, they should be wrapped inside a
      <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element and can use the same classes for
      sizing, shadows, or alignment. However, a video has to come in two
      different formats for best software freedom support (Webm) and
      compatibility (MP4), and in different resolutions for bandwidth saving.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our primary video platform is our <a
      href="https://media.fsfe.org">Peertube instance</a>. You should
      upload/import the video there first, or ask the responsible person for
      this. This video is then available via a link, e.g.
      <code>https://media.fsfe.org/w/kGvs3JNADvvQfkC1dR9FGr</code>.
    </p>

    <!-- TODO: check regularly whether this has improved -->
    <p>
      Unfortunately, we currently cannot directly embed the video from Peertube
      directly. Therefore, we provide the <a
      href="https://git.fsfe.org/fsfe-system-hackers/peertube-embedder">Peertube
      Embedder</a>, a script on our <a
      href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/TechDocs/DownloadServer">download server</a>
      that automates the necessary processes of download and conversion. Please
      follow the tool's documentation to learn how to use it and how it works.
      There you will also find a list of drawbacks of this temporary solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this is finished, you will receive a tag like the following:
      <code>&lt;peertube url="https://media.fsfe.org/w/kGvs3JNADvvQfkC1dR9FGr"
      /&gt;</code> that is internally translated into the video. Wrap this in a
      figure, and optionally extend it with a caption and a link to the original
      video:
    </p>

    <figure>
      <peertube url="https://media.fsfe.org/w/kGvs3JNADvvQfkC1dR9FGr" />
      <figcaption>
        Video about Upcycling Android. <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/kGvs3JNADvvQfkC1dR9FGr">All subtitles and more videos...</a>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>

    <p>
      For many pages it may make sense to add quotes in between a wall of text.
      Also here, the FSFE website provides a number of options: raw text, or
      enriched by a picture, the quoted person's name etc:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This is a standard quote. Remember that you'll still have to wrap
        paragraphs in their respective <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Let's add the author of a quote nicely by adding
      <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The problem with internet quotes is that you cannot always depend on
        their accuracy."
      </p>
      <cite>Abraham Lincoln</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      To increase authenticity even more, let's add a picture next to the quote:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <div class="with-image-left">
        <img src="/graphics/logos/android.png" alt="A happy Android" />
        <div>
          <p>
            "Finally I am free! Thanks to the FSFE's 'Free Your Android' and
            'Upcycling Android' campaigns, I learnt how to break free from
            proprietary dependencies! I recommend every android and human to do
            the same."
          </p>
          <cite>A. Droid, random mobile phone</cite>
        </div>
      </div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Another example with different mixture of classes. We apply
      <code>small-img</code> to the <code>with-image-right</code> div that, as
      the name says, puts the image to the right instead of the left. We also
      use the class <code>img-circle</code> on Matthias' picture. Note that for
      this, the picture must be square!
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <div class="with-image-right small-img">
        <img class="img-circle" src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/small/1ac31d3b54bd0ed7db27a074c6d1f7ab.jpg" alt="Matthias Kirschner" />
        <div>
          <p>
            "We are happy to see that the good energy and resources the FSFE
            community dedicates on creating, translating and promoting the
            campaign's objectives keeps increasing support from major public
            stakeholders."
          </p>
          <cite>Matthias Kirschner</cite>
        </div>
      </div>
    </blockquote>


    <h2 id="interviews">Interviews</h2>

    <p>
      We sometimes publish interviews, for example with an interesting person.
      Sometimes, we also ask the same questions to multiple political parties,
      and want to list their answers using the party colours. Find out how this
      works:
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        The bold text is done manually with <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>. There
        is not uniform style guide (yet), so have a look at how other interviews
        are doing this.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p class="question">
      <strong>FSFE: What are the freedoms of Free Software?</strong>
    </p>

    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        <strong>Jane Doe</strong>: These are the freedoms to use, study, share,
        and improve software.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write this in a second paragraph on the same level: They safeguard
        user rights!
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="question">
      <strong>What is the answer to all questions?</strong>
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        Here, we are going one level deeper of one question, so with stacking
        indentation. It's not used widely, so probably it's not wise to use it.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        I assume it's 42.
      </p>

      <div class="question2">
        <p>
          <strong>FSFE: Are you sure? Isn't it 23?</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="answer2">
        <p>
          Oh, well, I don't know.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <p>
        <strong>Thank you for your time.</strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <aside>
      <p>
        Back to the normal level.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        Likewise.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you look at the source code, you will see that we sometimes use
      <code>&lt;p class="question"&gt;</code> and sometimes <code>&lt;div
      class="answer"&gt;</code> with multiple <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> inside. If
      a question or answer contains multiple paragraphs, wrap them in a
      &lt;div&gt; with this class, but leave the &lt;p&gt;s without any class.
      If they are only one paragraph, it's suffient to just use a &lt;p&gt; with
      the respective class.
    </p>

    <h3>Party questions (like Ask Your Candidates)</h3>

    <p>
      For parties, we have some predefined coloured boxes. You will find them in
      the file <code>/look/elements/interview-ayc.less</code>. Here is a <a
      href="https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/fsfe-website/src/commit/2a8709c12ea00d69581fb40a2e5a02204c1b82ff/look/elements/interview-ayc.less#L48">snapshot</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
      <strong>What is your favourite colour?</strong>
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>For the first answer, we use a single &lt;p&gt; with the class
      <code>answer party diegrüne</code>.</p>
    </aside>

    <p class="answer party diegrüne">
      <strong>Leaf Party</strong>: Obviously green and every variation of it.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>For the second answer, we wrap the two "unclassed" &lt;p&gt; in a div
      with the class <code>answer party spd</code>.</p>
    </aside>

    <div class="answer party spd">
      <p>
        <strong>Sun Party</strong>: Red as the sun that keeps us all warm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Did you know that red has the colour code #FF0000?
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="answer party csu">
      <strong>Sky Party</strong>: Blue, because it makes us calm and is pretty
      to look at.
    </p>


    <h2 id="toc">Tables of contents</h2>

    <p>
      If you have a long page, adding a table of contents may come in handy. We
      offer a few options here. The default one is using a div with the class
      <code>toc</code>. Inside, the first p element is the headline, and then
      followed by a list, either ordered or unordered. If you choose ordered,
      our system will automatically number the items accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can link the different points to specific points of your page.
      Ideally, you do this via <a href="#anchor-links">anchor links</a> that you
      define manually for headlines.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also introduce a hierarchy of list items. For this, start a new
      ordered list ("ol") or unordered list ("ul") within a list item ("li") on
      the parent level. Below, you can find two non-functional examples: one
      with ordered lists (numbers), one with unordered lists (bullet points) on
      the first level, and numbered on the second.
    </p>

    <div class="toc">
      <p>Numbered contents</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="#first">First item</a>
        </li>
        <li>Second item on first level, from here on without links
          <ol>
            <li>First item on second level</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Third item on first level</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <div class="toc">
      <p>Bullet and numbered points mixed</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#first">First item</a>
        </li>
        <li>Second item on first level, from here on without links
          <ul>
            <li>First item on second level</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Third item on first level
          <ol> <!-- Please, think really hard whether you want to mix ul and ol! -->
            <li>We can even mix ordered and unordered lists!
              <ol>
                <li>OK, now it's getting silly...</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you don't want the table of contents to use up the full width, you can
      also move it to the left or right of the page. On the very top of this
      page you can find and example for a table of contents being on the right
      side, which is done by adding the class <code>float-right</code> to the
      ToC's div element. <code>float-left</code> would do the opposite.
    </p>


    <h2 id="sidebar-howto">Sidebar</h2>

    <p>
      Depending on the class of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element, you page
      automatically has an empty space to the right (at least on larger
      screens). This is the sidebar which is defined below the closing
      <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can leave it empty (so just
      <code>&lt;sidebar&gt;&lt;/sidebar&gt;</code>), then the build system put
      some standard text there. But you can also use it for custom content. In
      this example, we put a headline with "Sidebar content" followed by a few
      links, <a href="#related-tags">related news</a>, and a paragraph. Below,
      there is a text motivating to support the FSFE, activated by adding the
      attribute <code>promo="support"</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      All available sidebar promos can be seen in
      <code>/build/xslt/fsfe_sidebar.xsl</code>. Currently, these are
      <code>our-work</code>, <code>support</code>, <code>donate</code> or
      <code>none</code>. Ask the web team if you miss something!
    </p>


    <h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>

    <p>
      There are pre-defined modules that you can include almost everywhere on
      fsfe.org. This way, translators don't have to translate the same text over
      and over again, and such things can be improved centrally. For instance,
      check this out:
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        This banner is called via <code>&lt;module id="banner-subscribe"
        /&gt;</code>
      </p>
    </aside>

    <module id="banner-subscribe" />

    <p>
      You can find all modules <a
      href="https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/fsfe-website/src/branch/master/global/data/modules">here</a>,
      and can add new ones. However, if you are not very familiar with the FSFE
      website, please consider asking the web mailing list or someone from this
      team first.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        There is also the <a href="https://webpreview.fsfe.org">webpreview
        tool</a> to quickly show how a page can look like, and much more.
        However, many of the features presented here will not work with the
        tool. Therefore, a local build is the best way to simulate how your
        changes will look like in the end.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      Small pitfall: if you <a
      href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/TechDocs/Mainpage/BuildLocally">build the
      website locally</a> and include a module in a page for the first time,
      you'll have to run <code>make</code> after including a module once.
    </p>


    <h2 id="footnotes-howto">Footnotes</h2>

    <p>
      Especially for studies and longer articles, you may want to use footnotes.
      This is simple to achieve once you understand the basic principle.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this paragraph, we'll add two footnotes. One is here<a id="ref-1"
      href="#fn-1" role="doc-noteref"></a>, and let's put another one behind
      here<a id="ref-2" href="#fn-2" role="doc-noteref"></a>. The cool thing:
      you don't have to set the numbers yourself! However, it's critical that
      you retain <code>role="doc-noteref"</code> for each of them, and
      <code>role="doc-backlink"</code> for the backlinks below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally, you would have the actual footnotes at the end of the page, so
      just before <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>, but let's put it next to this
      paragraph.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        Check the &#8617; signs. They refer back to where the footnote's number
        was first mentioned. This works thanks to <a href="#anchor-links">anchor
        links</a>.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2> <!-- This headline is hidden, but please keep it anyway -->
    <ol>
      <li id="fn-1">
        We called this footnote <code>fn-1</code> and the backlink
        <code>ref-1</code> but that's completely up to you. <a class="ref"
        href="#ref-1" role="doc-backlink"></a>
      </li>
      <li id="fn-2">
        Most importantly, it should be consistent across the page so you don't
        get confused by the <code>fn-number</code> and
        <code>ref-number</code>.
        <a class="ref" href="#ref-2" role="doc-backlink"></a>
      </li>
    </ol>


    <h2 id="structure">Structuring content</h2>

    <p>
      By default, if you just enter text in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements, you
      just create a wall of text. Sometimes it makes sense to split the page, or
      otherwise organise information in smaller pieces. Here are some examples
      of what you can do:
    </p>

    <h3>50-50 grid</h3>

    <p>
      With <code>&lt;div class="grid-50-50"&gt;</code> and the follow-up divs
      you can create two or more boxes besides each other. On smaller screens,
      they will be below each other, allowing for enough space. The boxes can
      contain text, pictures, or videos. Just make sure that the boxes are
      somewhat equal in height to give it a good look.
    </p>

    <div class="grid-50-50">
      <div class="box">
        <p>This is how the law is currently drafted:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You shall not use software for every purpose</li>
          <li>You shall not be able to study technology</li>
          <li>You must not share software with friends</li>
          <li>By no means you must be able to improve technology</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <p>This is what the FSFE proposes instead:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You have the freedom to use software for any purpose</li>
          <li>You have the freedom to study software</li>
          <li>You have the freedom to shate software with everyone</li>
          <li>You have the freedom to improve the software</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Icon grid</h3>

    <p>
      Instead of a mere 50/50 box, you may want to add icons to smaller points
      you are making. Here, we offer a neat icon grid with exciting options.
      Let's check out the basic version:
    </p>

    <div class="icon-grid">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <img src="/graphics/icons/autonomy.png" alt="" />
          <div>
            <h3>Autonomy</h3>
            <p>
              Free Software helps to develop and maintain tailored software that
              suits your needs, not just the vendor's business model.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <img src="/graphics/icons/collaboration.png" alt="" />
          <div>
            <h3>Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
              Free Software can be shared and used in a non-exclusive way by
              everyone – serving the public good.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <img src="/graphics/icons/share-copy.png" alt="" />
          <div>
            <h3>Share &amp; Copy</h3>
            <p>

              to be run, without paying extra.

          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <img src="/graphics/icons/no-lock-in.png" alt="" />
          <div>
            <h3>No Lock-in</h3>
            <p>
              Free Software licences reinforce independence from vendors and
              provide more choice in service providers.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Some extra classes can refine the whole look and make it very flexible. We
      will look at <code>icons-sm</code>, <code>one-per-row</code>,
      <code>no-icons</code>, and <code>icons-middle</code> in short examples.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        Let us start with small icons (<code>icons-sm</code>) and icons in the
        middle (<code>icons-middle</code>).
      </p>
    </aside>

    <div class="icon-grid icons-sm icons-middle">

        If you have a lot of text, <code>one-per-row</code> comes in handy.

    <h2 id="related-tags">Related content via tags</h2>

    <p>
      On campaign websites you may want to automatically include the latest news
      about your activity. This works on the basis of tags. Each news item
      should carry tags. The currently existing tags are listed <a
      href="/tags/tags.html">here</a>. What's important is the tag's
      <code>key</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the tags section of <a
      href="/news/2021/news-20211203-01.html">this news items</a> looks like the
      following:
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        The <code>front-page</code> tag just indicates that a news item shall be
        listed on the frontpage of fsfe.org.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <pre><code>&lt;tags&gt;
  &lt;tag key="front-page"/&gt;
  &lt;tag key="internal"&gt;FSFE Internal&lt;/tag&gt;
  &lt;tag key="tech-teams"&gt;Technical Teams&lt;/tag&gt;
&lt;/tags&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
      Now, we want to include news about the technical teams of the FSFE below
      this paragraph, and also in the sidebar. This looks like the following:
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        Saving you the look into the source code, the content starting from the
        "Related News" headline until "All related news and events" is just
        generated with <code>&lt;related-feed tag="tech-teams" /&gt;</code>.
        Nice, huh?
      </p>
    </aside>

    <related-feed tag="tech-teams" />

    <hr />

    <p>
      In order to make this work, you need to create a file next to the XHTML
      file you are creating anyway. In the case of this page, whose file is
      called <code>features.en.xhtml</code>, you'll need to create
      <code>features.sources</code>. In <a
      href="https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/fsfe-website/src/branch/master/contribute/web/features.sources">this
      file</a>, you define the files that the build system shall look for as
      candidates for inclusion. The content of this article's sources file is:
    </p>

    <pre><code>news/*/*:[tech-teams]
news/*/.*:[tech-teams]
events/*/*:[tech-teams]
events/*/.*:[tech-teams]</code></pre>

    <p>
      It asks the build system to have a look at all news items and events that
      contain the tag <code>tech-teams</code>. But the system will the only
      regard news items that have already been released (date older than today),
      and event entries that are upcoming or currently ongoing, not past ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      Variation: for the <a href="#related-list">sidebar</a> we've chosen
      <code>&lt;related-list tag="tech-teams" count="2" /&gt;</code> instead of
      <code>related-feed</code>. This does two extra things: the list does not
      feature the latest news/event but is a plain list of entries. And with the
      <code>count</code> attribute we overwrite the default value of maximum 5
      entries and limit the list to the two most recent news/events.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the way: if you don't want to display news items, just delete the lines
      starting with "news/" - and vice versa for events - from the
      <code>.sources</code> files.
    </p>


    <h2 id="buttons">Buttons</h2>

    <p>
      A very simple but powerful element is buttons. There are countless options
      so we just mention the most used ones. In general, a button in our website
      is nothing more than a <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element with a few extra
      classes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a class="btn btn-default">Default button</a>
      <a class="btn btn-primary">Button with the primary color</a>
      <a class="btn btn-lg btn-success">Large green button</a>
      <a class="btn btn-xs btn-danger">Extra-small red button</a>
      <a class="btn btn-warning" href="#buttons">Orange button with link to this section</a>
    </p>

    <p class="text-center">
      <a class="btn btn-lg btn-info">A centered button</a>
    </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        Bootstrap is a framework for CSS, so the stylesheets. It already
        includes a lot of classes like the styling of buttons, their colours and
        much more.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      For more, you can check out the corresponding section on <a
      href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#buttons">our Bootstrap
      version's documentation</a>.
    </p>


    <h2 id="colour-boxes">Coloured boxes</h2>

    <p>
      Sometimes, you may want to put some content within coloured frames, or
      have an element that has a unicolour background. Here are a few options,
      and all of them involve at least the class <code>color-box</code>.
      However, please do not overload your page.
    </p>

    <div class="color-box border" data-color="fsfe-blue">
      <p>
        This box is using the <code>class="color-box border"</code> and
        <code>data-color="fsfe-blue"</code>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The colours for <code>data-color</code> are defined in the file
      <code>/look/elements/color-box.less</code>. Here is a link to a <a
      href="https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/fsfe-website/src/commit/2a8709c12ea00d69581fb40a2e5a02204c1b82ff/look/elements/color-box.less#L23-L44">snapshotted
      version</a>.
    </p>

    <div class="color-box background" data-color="android-lime">
      <p>
        This box is using the <code>class="color-box background"</code> and
        <code>data-color="android-lime"</code>.
      </p>

      <a class="btn btn-sm btn-default">I am a button missing the href attribute</a>
    </div>

    <div class="color-box background rounded" data-color="android-blue">
      <p>
        This box is using the <code>class="color-box background rounded"</code> and
        <code>data-color="android-blue"</code>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      You can also stretch the box. A <code>fullwidth</code> box looks best on a
      <code>body class="toplevel"</code> or <code>body class="overview"</code>,
      so page formats that do not have a sidebar.
    </p>

    <div class="color-box background fullwidth" data-color="dark-green">
      <p>
        This box is using the <code>class="color-box background fullwidth"</code> and
        <code>data-color="dark-green"</code>.
      </p>
    </div>
