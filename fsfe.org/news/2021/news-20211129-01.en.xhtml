  <h1>Children’s book published about software, skateboards, and raspberry ice cream</h1>

<p>Today, 29 November, O'Reilly Germany publishes the book "Ada &amp; Zangemann - A
fairy tale about software, skateboards and raspberry ice cream" written by FSFE
President Matthias Kirschner and illustrated by Sandra Brandstätter, among
other things,  character designer for the series "Trudes Tier" from the show
"Sendung mit der Maus".</p>

<blockquote><p>The famous inventor Zangemann lives in a huge villa high above
the city. Adults and children alike love his inventions and are desperate to
have them. But then something happens: when Zangemann once again wants to take
a close-up look at his inventions during a walk through the city and, with a loud
thud, a child riding a skateboard hits him in the shin! Enraged, the inventor
makes a momentous decision... The clever girl Ada sees through it all. Together
with her friends, she forges a plan.</p></blockquote>

<p>This illustrated children's book tells the story of the famous inventor
Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment with
hardware and software, and in the process realises how crucial it is for her
and others to control technology.</p>

<p>A book for children from the age of 6 that arouses children's interest in
tinkering and encourages shaping technology.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Kirschner's book introduces readers young and old to the power and peril of
  software. It also highlights the accelerating effects of sharing software
  freely - creating conditions for direct and indirect collaboration which can
  be a metaphor for the conduct of science.  Behind it all is a backdrop of
  ethics of knowledge sharing upon which the arc of human history rides."</p>

  <p>Vint Cerf - Computer Scientist and one of the inventors of the internet
  (after reading the English translation).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Even as a non-child, I was captivated by the story from the first page to
  the last. Kudos to the author for packaging difficult topics such as
  monopolies, lobbyism, digital divide, software freedom, digital autonomy,
  IoT, consumer control, e-waste and much more in a child-friendly form in an
  easily understandable and exciting storyline.  And kudos to the publisher for
  having the guts to publish a book under CC-BY-SA."</p>

  <p>Jörg Luther, chief editor of the German Linux-Magazin, LinuxUser,
  Raspberry Pi Geek</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"After my son was read the book last night, he told me the whole story
  this morning... He wants to make something out of old pallets after school
  today. And then he wants to learn programming."</p>

  <p>Ingo Wichmann, CEO Linuxhotel GmbH</p>
