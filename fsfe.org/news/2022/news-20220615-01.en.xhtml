<p>
  We are looking for a Senior Project Manager Communication for 20-25 
  hours per week in our Berlin office. This is a great opportunity to 
  help amplify the importance of software freedom, so that every human 
  can use, study, share, and improve software and thereby support other 
  fundamental rights like freedom of speech, press, and privacy.

<h2 id="about-the-fsfe">About the FSFE</h2>

<p>
  Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to 
  control technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our 
  lives and it is important that technology empowers rather than 
  restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, 
  understand, adapt, and share software. These rights help support 
  other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press, and 
  privacy. 
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free 
  Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and 
  self-determination. It enhances users&#39; rights by abolishing 
  barriers to Free Software adoption, encourages people to use and 
  develop Free Software, and provides resources to enable everyone to 
  further promote Free Software in Europe.
</p>

<p>
  We are involved in <a href="/activities/index.html">many activities</a> in
