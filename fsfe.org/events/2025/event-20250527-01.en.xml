      <p>Lucas Lasota, FSFE Legal Programme Manager, is giving a talk online focusing on how the Digital Markets Act (DMA) relies on interoperability as one of its regulatory tool in Art. 6(7). He will explain the diverse challenges FOSS services and products face in requesting interoperability with software features controlled by iOS and iPadOS. Besides, to illustrate how interoperability has been regulated in the EU, this talk concludes with lessons learned from regulatory activity over interconnection of routers and modems). Telecom regulators in the EU have recurred to interoperability to open up infrastructure subjected to gatekeeper control.</p>
     <p>This talk is part of the Weizenbaum Instituteâ€™s ongoing series on Platforms, Markets, and the Digital Society.</p>
