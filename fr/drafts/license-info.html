<h3>Introduction</h3>

Providing legal protection for Free Software is possible using
copyright law. It turns out that granting freedom to software users is
a bit more complex than denying them all freedom. The license under
which a Free Software is distributed must therefore be designed with
great care to ensure that the author intent is respected.

<p> In the following you will find a description of the Copyleft
concept that can be viewed as an introduction to the reasoning that
someone has to make to provide protection for Free Software. The path
to actually write a license based on this reasoning is hard and long.

<p> Although some individuals and companies try to undertake this
enormous task, most of them realize that using an existing Free
Software license is much easier and much safer. We provide a list of
known Free Software licenses so that you can find the one that best
suit your purpose. When doing so you need to understand the benefits
of each license and be careful about compatibility issues.

<h3>Some Free Software licenses</h3>

The <i>(compat)</i> sign is added for each license which is compatible with
the GNU GPL license. For more information see the section related to license

<h3>For the impatient</h3>

<p> We encourage you to adopt the following attitude if you need to
take an immediate decision and can't spare time to educate yourself on
the licensing subject. These are over conservative advices you can
apply if you want to make sure that your freedom won't be jeopardized.
We urge you to learn more about the legal protection of Free Software
shortly afterwards. Reading this document and following pointers will
introduce you to the concepts and enable you to make up your mind. It
would be a mistake to consider these advices as a definitive way of
dealing with legal issues.

<ul>
<li>Only deal with software covered by the GNU GPL or GNU LGPL and documentation covered by the GNU FDL</li>
<li>Don't attempt to write a Free Software license</li>
<li>Don't attempt to find out if a license is Free Software</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Is Copyleft?</h3>

<p>
<em>Copyleft</em> is a general method for making a program <a
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>
and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be
Free Software as well.

<p>

The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the

<a
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#PublicDomainSoftware">public
domain</a>, uncopyrighted.  This allows people to share the program
and their improvements, if they are so minded.  But it also allows
uncooperative people to convert the program into <a
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#ProprietarySoftware">proprietary
software</a>.  They can make changes, many or few, and distribute the
result as a proprietary product.  People who receive the program in
that modified form do not have the freedom that the original author
gave them; the middleman has stripped it away.

<p> Let's say that your aim is to give <em>all</em> users the freedom
to redistribute and change the software you wrote.  If middlemen could
strip off the freedom, you might have many users, but those users would
not have freedom.  So instead of putting your software in the public
domain, you can ``copyleft'' it.  Copyleft says that anyone who
redistributes the software, with or without changes, must pass along
the freedom to further copy and change it.  Copyleft guarantees that
every user has freedom.

<p>
Copyleft also provides an
<a HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html">incentive</a>
for other programmers to add to free software.
Important free programs such as the GNU C++ compiler exist
only because of this.

<p> Copyleft also helps programmers who want to contribute
improvements to Free Software get permission to do that.  These
programmers often work for companies or universities that would do
almost anything to get more money.  A programmer may want to
contribute her changes to the community, but her employer may want to
turn the changes into a proprietary software product.

<p> When we explain to the employer that it is illegal to distribute
the improved version except as Free Software, the employer usually
decides to release it as Free Software rather than throw it away.

<p> To copyleft a program, you first state that it is copyrighted; then
you add distribution terms, which are a legal instrument that gives
everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the program's
code <em>or any program derived from it</em> but only if the
distribution terms are unchanged.  Thus, the code and the freedoms
become legally inseparable.

<p> Proprietary software developers use copyright to take away the users'
freedom; you can use copyright to guarantee their freedom.  That's why we
reverse the name, changing ``copyright'' into ``copyleft.''

<p> Copyleft is a general concept; there are many ways to fill in the
details.  In the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a> for
instance, the specific distribution terms are contained in
the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License
and the GNU Free Documentation License.  <p>

The appropriate license is included in many manuals and in each GNU
source code distribution.

<p> The GNU GPL is designed so that you can easily apply it to your
own program if you are the copyright holder.  You don't have to modify
the GNU GPL to do this, just add notices to your program which refer
properly to the GNU GPL. Please note that you must use the entire text
of the GPL, if you use it.  It is an integral whole, and partial
copies are not permitted.  (Likewise for the LGPL.)

<p> Using the same distribution terms for many different programs
makes it easy to copy code between various different programs.  Since
they all have the same distribution terms, there is no need to think
about whether the terms are compatible.  The Lesser GPL includes a
provision that lets you alter the distribution terms to the ordinary
GPL, so that you can copy code into another program covered by the
GPL.

<h3>Compatibility between licenses</h3>

A common problem when mixing various software distributed under 
different licenses is to make sure they are compatible. In a 
non free software world this problem is not very visible since
the license does not grant you any freedom beyond the ability to
run the software on a single machine. In the Free Software world
anyone can mix various piece of software and therefore run into
a potential conflict between the licensing terms.

<p> A compatibility study is made for the most wide spread license,
the GNU GPL. It lists licenses that are <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">compatible</a>
with it and the licenses that are <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLIncompatibleLicenses">incompatible</a>. Although
this on-going study is a good reference, every software author has to
think about the implications of using a specific license. Chosing a
license that has compatibility problems may lead to practical troubles
and prevent the use of the software in conjunction with others.

<h3>Rationale behind the choice of a license</h3>

Chosing a license rather than another may be a tough choice. It turns
out that the GNU GPL is fit for most software. However, it is often
the case that when someone has to decide for a license some questions
arise.  Will this license allow me to run a business based on my
software or will this license protect me from competitors willing to
takeover the software I wrote ? Providing a general answer to this
problem is almost impossible and certainly out of the scope of this
document.

<p> The best way to find which Free Software license is fit for the
software you wrote is to talk to people. Send mail to 
<a href="http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/Information/Associations/">non-profit Free
Software organizations</a> explaining your situation, weight their answers
and make up your mind. Always try to speak with at least one person
with actual experience, someone who had to face the same questions in
the past.

<p> The experience shows that chosing a Free Software license is only
partly a matter of evaluating advantages and drawbacks. Most of the
discussions surrounding this choice lead to a better understanding of
the Free Software movement. Once the level of understanding reach a
given level, the choice of the license if often straight forward.

<h3>Beware of translations</h3>

All Free Software licenses are written in english. If this is not your
native language you will probably find more convenient to read a translation
of this license. However you should realize that even the best translations
contain mistakes that <b>change the meaning</b> of the license. The 
translation may help you understand the license when you read it for the
first time. After that you should always read and refer to the original
version.

<p> The strongest incentive to use the translation of a license is to
better comply to national laws. This is rarely needed, unless you live
in a country who did not sign the Berne convention or made significant
exceptions to it. 

<p> In some cases governement agencies are forced to use licenses written
in the offcial language of the country. There is no easy solution to this
problem at present.
