<title>Software Freedom in Europe 2021</title>

<h1 id="software-freedom-in-europe-2021">Software Freedom in Europe 2021</h1>

  <p>
  Cancelling of large events, limitations in meetings, and travel
  restrictions: none of this stopped the FSFE from advancing software
  freedom in 2021. From Router Freedom to new podcast episodes to
  co-organising the Legal and Policy devroom at FOSDEM, we keep
  empowering people to control technology.
  </p>

  <p>
   'Public Money? Public Code!' online workshops were offered to
   volunteers, and an online Legal and Licensing Workshop for legal
   experts was organised. The FSFE assisted software projects to
   become REUSE compliant with our new initiative, REUSE Booster. We
   created a monitoring map to demonstrate the developments of
   Router Freedom rights in Europe. The FSFE presented suggestions
   and demands to support sustainable software. Meanwhile, a two-year
   court case initiated by FSFE supporter Luca Bonissi successfully
   came to an end, unequivocally recognising the right to a Windows
   licence refund. Overall, significant accomplishments for software
   freedom marked 2021, the year <strong>FSFE is celebrating its 20th
   anniversary</strong>.

  <p>
  While this yearly report corresponds to our work during November
  2020 - October 2021, many of our activities last for many years. We
  are celebrating our 20-years milestone because ultimately
  <strong>it is our long term presence that allows us to advance
  software freedom</strong>. Initiatives become more robust every
  year, as we have seen with the growing adoption of 'Public Money?
  Public Code!' and REUSE.
  </p>

  <p>
  In 2017, we launched the 'Public Money? Public Code!' campaign,
  convincing several public administrations to change their IT
  strategy. Since then, the accompanying open letter has been signed
  by over 200 civil society organisations and several public
  administrations like the city of Barcelona and the Swedish JobTech
  Development center. The same year, we also initiated REUSE to
  provide a set of recommendations that make licensing Free Software
  projects easier for developers. Since then, REUSE has been adopted
  by well-known projects such as the German Corona Warn App and
  KDE.
  </p>

  <p>
  Likewise, informing the public about the benefits of Free Software
  is a core activity that builds up over time. We inform people in
  information booths, we run workshops and give talks, we send out a
  monthly Newsletter and publish a podcast episode every two months to
  help the Free Software community grow and stay connected. Our "I
  Love Free Software Day", which started over a decade ago, is
  celebrated around the globe every year on 14 February. Still,
  sometimes our endeavors succeed after an entire journey which
  brings us in parliaments or to courts, as the <a href="/activities/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.html">Microsoft v. EU case</a>
  did. This is why <strong> continuous engagement for software
  freedom matters</strong>.

 <h3 id="20-years-fsfe">Celebrating 20 Years FSFE</h3>

  <p>
     Long before the first smartphone was introduced, it was evident
     to the FSFE's founders that it is the people who should be in
     control of technology. In 2001, Free Software
     experts around Europe therefore created the Free Software
     Foundation Europe e.V. In 2021, the <strong> <a href="/about/">Free Software Foundation Europe</a>
     turned 20</strong>. This means two decades of empowering users to control
     technology. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, study, share, and improve software. This way, Free Software contributes to freedom,
       transparency, and self-determination.

  <p>
    The FSFE was founded in <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2001q2/000003.html">April
    2001</a>, so this year in April 2021 we started having a look <a href="/activities/20years/20years.html">at our community and
    previous work</a>. We contacted people who paved the way of the
    FSFE since its beginning, such as long term volunteers and past
    staffers. We have interviewed <a href="/news/2021/news-20210204-01.html">Georg Greve</a>, <a href="/news/2021/news-20210625-01.html">Torsten Grote</a>, <a href="/news/2021/news-20210305-01.html">Reinhard Müller</a>, <a href="/news/2021/news-20210420-01.html">and Fernanda Weiden</a>,
    and we received a video message from <a href="/news/2021/news-20210529-01.html">Cory Doctorow</a>. We shared
    the FSFE <a href="/activities/20years/20years.html#Highlights-from-the-last-20-years">highlights
    from the last 20 years</a>, and Matthias Kirschner, President of
    the FSFE since 2015, <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/2BiZdZjoM7oy4Jo4fRvVKJ">presented</a>
    the work of the organisation since its founding. To mark this
    important milestone, we produced a <a href="/order/index.html#bag-since2001-blue">bag</a> and
    a <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#fsfe-since-2001-sticker">sticker</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Although technology is ever-changing, our values have been
  consistent throughout the last twenty years. The core of our work
  is, in a nutshell: highlighting the sociopolitical implications of
  Free Software, simplifying its legal preconditions, and educating
  people on the nature of Free Software. Therefore, we divide our
  work into three areas: Policy Advocacy, Legal Support, and Public
  Awareness. Matthias Kirschner explains this in his own words in a
  short video:

<h2 id="policy">Policy advocacy</h2>

  <h3 id="pmpc">1. Raising 'Public Money? Public Code!' demand</h3>

  <p>
  Why is software created using taxpayers’ money not released as Free
  Software? The 'Public Money? Public Code!' initiative was launched
  in 2018. Its popularity demonstrates that our continuous effort
  through the years can make a difference. More than 200 organisations and
  administrations support our call for action by signing our <a href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">open letter</a>. Good news
  of municipalities embracing Free Software keeps coming in.
  In 2021, PMPC progressed in a variety of sectors, ranging from EU
  policy to public health related apps.
  </p>

  <h3 id="eu-open-source-strategy">Examining the EU Open Source Strategy</h3>

  <p>
  The FSFE <a href="/news/2020/news-20201023-01.html">examined</a>
  the new 'Open Source Strategy' of the EU for the period 2020-2023 and
  raised its concerns. The benefits of Free Software are fully
  emphasised and the Commission is on paper ambitious in its future
  use of Free Software. However, concrete goals are rare and a clear
  commitment to the use of Free Software is lacking. The strategy
  mainly repeats previous commitments and activities; sustainable and
  verifiable approaches are sought in vain.
  </p>

  <figcaption>The EU Open Source Strategy 2020-2023 is ambitious but lacks concrete goals.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    In February 2021, we <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/ecoss/">interviewed</a>
    Evangelos Tsavalopoulos, Head of Sector of the European Commission Open Source Software Unit, and addressed the most important
    questions about this strategy.
  </p>

<h3 id="pmpc-workshops">Offering PMPC Workshops</h3>

  <p>
    In the framework of its campaign 'Public Money? Public
    Code!', the FSFE has launched a workshop series, '<a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/ContactingAdministrationsForPMPC">Contact
    your administrations</a>'. Its target audience is volunteers and
    supporters from all over Europe who want to become active in
    reaching out to their local representatives. This workshop aims
    to share best practices when addressing public administrations to
    discuss Free Software in the public sector, while empowering
    volunteers to become more active within their own communities.
    During 2021, Lina Ceballos, an FSFE Project Manager, and
    Alexander Sander, Policy Consultant of the FSFE, held online
    sessions of this workshop for our Italian and Spanish
    communities. Alexander Sander and Bonnie Mehring, Translations
    Coordinator, held the online session for this workshop in German.
  </p>


<h3 id="code-repository-public-sector">Conceptualising a code repository for the public sector</h3>

  <p>
    Together with our associated organisation the 'Open Source
    Business Alliance', the federal working group of municipal IT
    service providers and other experts, FSFE has developed a first
    concept for a code repository for the public sector (<a href="/news/2020/news-20200910-01.html">EN</a>, <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/papers/20200910-Ein-Ort-fuer-oeffentlichen-Code.v1.pdf">DE,
    .pdf</a>). In the proposal, we clarified the potential of Free
    Software for use in public institutions and how such a repository
    can contribute to the further development of the digitalisation
    of administrations. This concept is already being tested with a
    pilot project in the German states of <a href="/news/nl/nl-202103.html#what-have-we-done-inside-and-outside-the-fsfe">North
    Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Württemberg in cooperation with the
    Ministry of Interior</a>.

  <figcaption>The FSFE conceptualised a code repository for the public sector. It is being tested in a pilot project.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<h3 id="public-health-apps">Demanding Free Software in Public Health related apps</h3>

  <p>
    Amid the difficulties of the pandemic, the FSFE identifies a
    crucial aspect: that apps related to public health should be Free
    Software. This way they will be transparent, trustworthy, and
    available to people who consciously avoid proprietary software.
    Throughout this challenge <a href="/news/2020/news-20200402-02.html">our demands focus on user
    rights</a>, and this is reflected in our work. In December of
    2020, the FSFE stood in favour of coronavirus tracing apps to be
    Free Software and thanked the volunteers who <a href="https://codeberg.org/corona-contact-tracing-germany/cwa-android">liberated</a>
    the German Corona Warn app (CWA). The FSFE <a href="/news/2020/news-20201208-01.html">appealed</a> to
    governments and administrations to publish developed software as
    Free Software, to break dependencies on proprietary app stores
    and instead make their apps installable from independent sources
    like F-Droid, and to renounce proprietary dependencies. This also
    helps to protect fundamental rights such as the right to privacy.
  </p>

  <figure>

  <figcaption>Example of Corona Tracing app</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    In August 2021, we witnessed the same
    problematic pattern in Germany: volunteers once more had to step
    in to take over the government's task in order to make the
    CovPass app available to everyone. The FSFE <a href="/news/2021/news-20210830-01.html">urges</a>
    the government to quickly adapt its practices and make sure
    everyone can use such apps without any restrictions from the
    start. Furthermore, if it is ensured that solutions are published as
    Free Software, they can be adjusted and reused by other
    institutions around the world.
  </p>

  <h3 id="participation-apps">Demanding accessibility to political participation apps</h3>

  <p>
  In the Netherlands, the official application for parliamentary debates is not
  available under a Free Software license.
   In 2018, FSFE supporter Jos van den Oever noticed that the 'Debat Direct' app
  could not be downloaded to his Firefox OS phone. Jos' request to get the
  app's source code was denied, and he brought the case to court. The
  Council of State ruled on 31 March 2021 that the Parliament does
  not have to publish the source code. The FSFE therefore <a href="/news/2021/news-20210611-01.html">calls
  upon the Dutch Parliament</a> to impose rules on itself, to act
  transparently, and to publish the source code of such applications
  under a Free Software licence in the future.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/530aa5d4c4403f5a23c1df4f65525f21.jpg" alt="Dutch parliament in the Hague" />
    <figcaption>The FSFE calls upon the Dutch Parliament to publish the source code of political participation apps.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
   Moreover, the FSFE calls on the Dutch government to <a href="/news/2021/news-20210521-01.html">stand firm and get a grip
   on their digital security and autonomy by adhering to Open
   Standards and Free Software</a>, in line with their earlier
   commitment to use Free Software by default. The Netherlands is
   becoming dependent on a digital infrastructure that is dominated
   by a small number of monopolistic companies. Although the Dutch
   Cyber Security Council recognises the consequent risk, their
   report neglects focusing on Open Standards and Free Software, the
   proven best practices to face this problem.
  </p>

<h3 id="spreading-the-word">Spreading the word</h3>

  <p>
    In 2021 we translated our 'Public Money? Public Code!'
    video into <a href="https://publiccode.eu/sv/#about">Swedish</a> and
    <a href="https://publiccode.eu/nl/#about">Dutch</a>.
    Apart from those translations, the PMPC video is available in
    English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and
    Slovenian. We also translated the PMPC brochure into Spanish.
  </p>

<h3 id="local-governments">Bringing Free Software to local governments</h3>

  <p>
  On May 2021, we contributed to a report on the use of Free Software
  in <a href="https://www.kgst.de/documents/20181/34177/KGSt-Bericht-5-2021_Open-Source.pdf/994d10d0-ec25-f8ed-91af-1a12518c27d3">local
  administrations</a> (DE)(.pdf) which was released by the German
  association for municipal government. </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/900719f3ded7729bef6a039d9726e350.jpg" />
    <figcaption>Dortmund embraces Free Software</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
  With an overwhelming
  cross-faction majority, <a href="/news/2021/news-20210331-01.html">Dortmund</a> committed itself to the use of
  Free Software in a groundbreaking <a href="/news/2021/news-20210331-01.html">resolution</a>
  (DE) in February 2021. The case of Dortmund, where the motion
  passed unanimously, proves that all sides can appreciate the
  practical benefits of Free Software. The result was made possible
  by the consistent efforts of the DO-FOSS initiative, which also
  supported the "Public Money? Public Code!" campaign of the
  FSFE. The Council's decision means that there is now
  political backing to gradually break down dependencies on
  proprietary vendors. The FSFE will follow the implementation and
  at the same time call on other administrations in Germany and
  Europe to follow Dortmund's example.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Swiss cantons of <a href="/news/2021/news-20210318-01.html">Bern and Uri</a>
  embraced Free Software and the FSFE met online with the people
  behind this process. Bern followed the steps of another Swiss
  canton, Uri, trailbrazer for the use of Free Software in
  administration. For years, the Free Software app 'Caluma' has
  been successful in Switzerland. The example of the cantons of Uri
  and Bern shows that the principle of "Public Money? Public
  Code!" benefits everyone: citizens, the administration, and
  also the economy.
   </p>

   <h3 id="sustainability">2. Discovering the sustainability of Free Software</h3>

  <p>
   We recently published a study <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">'On the
   Sustainability of Free Software'</a> that includes five core demands about <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html#what-can-politics-and-society-do-for-a-more-sustainable-digitization">What
   can politicians and society do for a more sustainable
   digitization?</a> Among them are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
    When the software of a device is not supported any more, the
    manufacturers should publish the source code of the software
    under a Free Software license.
    </li>
    <li>
    Users must be given the right to install the operating system
    of their choice on their own devices, as well as any software.
   </li>
   <li>
     Devices should be produced with open standards, drivers,
     and interfaces, to ensure a sustainable use of hardware
     resources.
    </li>
  </ul>

  Erik Albers, Program Manager of the FSFE, also gave a <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/wk04-7557-von-freier-software-zu-nachhaltiger-software-und-wieder-zurck">talk</a>
  (DE) about the subject of software sustainability at this
  year's Winterkongress, the annual conference from the Swiss Digital Intiative, and in the second round table <a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu/en/article/event/how-do-we-shape-and-grow-a-green-tech-sector">"How
  do we shape and grow a green tech sector?"</a>, organised by
  the Greens/EFA in the European Parliament. In February, Erik
  co-published the <a href="https://www.oekologisches-wirtschaften.de/index.php/oew/article/view/1788">paper</a>
  "Design Options for Long-lasting, Efficient and Open Hardware
  and Software" in "Ökologisches Wirtschaften:
  Digitalisation and Sustainability". In January we <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12797-Designing-mobile-phones-and-tablets-to-be-sustainable-ecodesign/F1465695_en">participated</a>
  in the European Comission's consultation about "Designing
  mobile phones and tablets to be sustainable – ecodesign". </p>

<h3 id="router-freedom">3. Supporting Router Freedom in the EU</h3>

  <p>
    Since 2013 the FSFE has been a leading voice in promoting
    end-users' right to use their own personal modems and
    routers. Router Freedom is not a one-time achievement. As the
    regulations change, our work is continuous to defend this digital
    right. Our long-term engagement for Software Freedom is needed,
    and it makes a difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    2021 represented a milestone for the implementation of Router
    Freedom in Europe. We exerted great efforts to protect Router
    Freedom on the European level. We have been involved in
    legislative processes and implementation of technical rules  in
    diverse jurisdictions in the EU. Also, we provided to communities
    and individuals all necessary elements to engage in initiatives
    so that they can push the agenda on a political level.
  </p>

    <figcaption>We have been promoting Router Freedom all over Europe. SFSCon, 2019. </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This year demonstrated that although the regulatory framework
    remains fragmented in the EU, Router Freedom is emerging as a
    prospective reality. We empowered people to defend their right to
    use their own internet equipment all over Europe.
  </p>

<h3 id="rf-informing">Informing and empowering the public</h3>

  <p>
    In response to the EU reform of telecommunications law (EECC), we
    explained that <a href="/news/2020/news-20200601-01.html">Router
    Freedom is fundamental for security and privacy</a> and
    summarized the current status in an <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-router-freedom-activity-summary.pdf">Activity
    Summary</a>. Router Freedom is essential for fair competition in
    markets and sustainability by promoting compatibility among
    devices and the right to repair.
  </p>

  <p>
    In March 2021, when EU countries started to implement the telecom
    reform, we launched an <a href="/news/2021/news-20210330-01.html">Engagement Package</a> so
    that anyone can organize supporting activities for Router
    Freedom. The included <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters/">wiki
    page</a> helps the volunteers of the initiative identify
    interested people, collect information, and set up courses of
    action. To involve the maximum number of people, we promoted
    Router Freedom in several events, gave talks, and organised expert
    meetings with stakeholders all over Europe. Our demands have been
    shared by several groups in public consultations and official
    hearings.

  <p>
    We followed closely the positive developments in the <a href="/news/2021/news-20210805-01.html">Netherlands</a>,
    which confirmed our demands for consumer rights. In June 2021, we
    talked with a representative of the <a href="/news/2021/news-20210629-01.html">Finnish
    regulator</a>, who explained why Router Freedom is essential for
    net neutrality. Our coordinated activities in <a href="/news/2021/news-20210505-01.html">Greece</a>
    in May 2021 supported that regulator's preliminary decision to
    secure Router freedom. We worked closely with consumer
    organisations, digital groups, and business representatives to promote and leverage the
    agenda, demanding clear rules for consumers, as in the beginning
    of the legislative process in <a href="/news/2021/news-20210506-01.html">Austria</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  On another hand, we have monitored issues with implementations
  which could harm Router Freedom. We raised our concerns when <a href="/news/2021/news-20210505-01.html">Germany</a>
  decided to step back from the positive experience the country has
  built since 2016 by allowing the national regulator to determine a
  regulatory framework against consumers. <a href="/news/2021/news-20211027-01.html">Latvia</a> opened an extremely dangerous precedent by
  allowing ISPs to determine by themselves technological issues to
  prohibit the use of personal routers.
  </p>

<h3 id="collecting-data">Collecting Data</h3>

  <p>
    Router Freedom is undergoing a rapid development in Europe, so we
    created a <a href="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/router-freedom-tracker_581123#4/53.12/18.37">monitoring
    map</a> to help everyone keep track of the Router Freedom status
    in their countries.

  <p>
  To understand better the issues end-users are facing with ISPs'
  abusive commercial practices, we started a <a href="https://survey.fsfe.org/index.php/628449?lang=en">survey</a>.
  With this research, which is unique in the EU, we aim to
  gather data about end-user experience, so we can highlight the
  issues to regulators and decision makers. Our survey is still open
  and you are welcome to answer our questions.

<h3 id="international-development-cooperation">4. Promoting Free Software in international development cooperation</h3>

  <p>
    In December 2020, the FSFE published an <a href="/freesoftware/developmentcooperation/index.html">analysis</a>
    of the benefits of using Free Software in international
    development cooperation. In this increasingly digitised sector,
    Free Software is becoming an indispensable fundamental technology
    that guarantees legally compliant international cooperation and
    reuse. With Free Software, global scaling is possible, as well as
    local adaptability. New monopolies and dependencies are avoided,
    which is a major UN sustainability goal.

<h3 id="radio-lockdown">5. Preventing a Radio Lockdown</h3>

  <p>
    Since 2015, we have been monitoring the possible unpleasant
    effects of the European Radio Equipment Directive, for which we coined the term
    <a href="/activities/radiodirective/">Radio Lockdown</a>.
    Although the FSFE has warned the European Commission multiple
    times of the disastrous consequences Article 3(3)(i) can have for
    users, organisations, and the whole communication equipment
    market, the regulators did not give in. However, in the past 12
    months the Commission did not propose any concrete draft
    regulations, so we are in limbo. The FSFE will continue to
    monitor the situation closely.
  </p>

<h3 id="german-warning-system">6. Suggesting improvements to the German warning system</h3>

  <p>
    Already in November 2020, the FSFE flagged that <a href="/news/2020/news-20201112-01.html">Germany's warning system is
  unstable and ineffective</a> and pointed out pragmatic improvements
  that can guarantee that a warning message can reach every person
  needed while respecting software freedom and privacy.
  Unfortunately, our suggestions were not implemented in time:
  the German warning system once again failed in July 2021 during a
  number of heavy regional floodings, after which the FSFE <a href="https://www.thelocal.de/20210730/germany-knew-its-disaster-warning-system-wasnt-good-enough-why-wasnt-it-improved-2/">repeated</a>
  that the more effective alternatives must be adopted as soon as
  possible to prepare for the next serious events. The commentary
  received several republications.
  Since this wake-up call, it seems the responsible administrations
  have been giving this crucial change the necessary attention and
  traction.

<h3 id="electoral-activities">7. Running electoral activities</h3>

  <p>
    Prior to the German elections we raised our <a href="/news/2021/news-20210427-01.html">PMPC demand</a>, in line
    with our <a href="/activities/elections/index.html">electoral
    activities</a>. During the final week before the German federal
    election we reached out to politicians asking their stance on
    Free Software. The FSFE and the Open Source Business Alliance conducted <a href="/news/2021/news-20210920-01.html">interviews with
    representatives of all political parties with a prospect of government participation</a>. The
    videos are available in German. Also we released our <a href="https://digitalezivilgesellschaft.org/digitalvisionen/">vision
    for the upcoming decades and concrete demands for the next
    government</a> (DE) and analyzed the <a href="https://digitalezivilgesellschaft.org/wahlpruefsteine/oeffentliches-gut/">elections
    programs</a> (DE) of the parties.

<h3 id="reuse-booster">1. Launching REUSE Booster</h3>

  <p>
   REUSE has facilitated the licensing of Free Software projects.
   Developers are given standardised ways to mark all files in a
   project with their chosen license and copyright notice. A
   tutorial, a set of FAQs, a helper tool, and an API have been made
   available to lower the threshold and save time.
  </p>

  <figure class="no-border">
  <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/0027eafb7bb2fdb1ec479675c1070ae2.png" alt="REUSE Booster logo" />
  </figure>

  <p>
  With <a href="https://reuse.software/booster/">REUSE Booster</a>,
  launched in 2021, the FSFE takes this initiative one step further.
  This progress was possible thanks to the support the FSFE has
  received, which enables the implementation of long-term activities.
  REUSE Booster enables Free Software projects to seek tailored
  support by our legal experts. As the name suggests, this will boost
  the process of adopting the best practices as well as general
  understanding of licensing and copyright. Each project is evaluated
  individually and the recommendations apply to its particular
  situation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Max Mehl joined a <a href="/news/podcast/episode-11.html">podcast</a> episode to
    present REUSE Booster and talk about the recent developments of
    the whole initiative. For example, REUSE was adopted by the KDE
    community as the standard best practice to communicate all
    projects' licensing and copyright situation. To learn how a large
    community like KDE managed this step, we interviewed <a href="/news/2020/news-20201215-01.html">Andreas
    Cord-Landwehr</a>, long-term developer at KDE, to discuss this
    implementation.
  </p>

  <h3 id="landmark-court-case">2. Celebrating win in landmark court case initiated by Luca Bonissi</h3>

  <p>
    On March 2021, FSFE supporter Luca Bonissi <a href="/news/2021/news-20210302-01.html">won a
    court case he initiated against Lenovo</a>. Ιn a historic judgment in Italy,
    Lenovo was
    ordered to pay 20,000 euros in damages for abusive behaviour in
    refusing to refund the price of a pre-installed Windows licence.
    In a motivating gesture for the Free Software cause, Luca donated
    15,000 euros to the FSFE.

<h3 id="llw">3. Organising the Legal and Licensing Workshop</h3>

  <p>
    In 2021, we organised and supported the first online edition of the
    <a href="/activities/ln/llw.html">Legal and
    Licensing Workshop</a>. The FSFE's Free Software Legal
    and Licensing Workshop (LLW) has been held annually for the <a href="/activities/ln/llw.html">FSFE's Legal Network</a>
    since 2008, and serves as a conference for <a href="/activities/ln/ln.html">legal experts</a> in the field
    of Free Software to debate over issues and share best practices
    surrounding Free Software licenses. Instead of a physical one-time
    conference, this year, from March to July, LLW offered online
    presentations, discussion panels, and workshops continuously.
  </p>

  <p>
     Discussions ranged from the recently concluded Google v. Oracle
     <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf">case</a>
     in the US Supreme Court to legal considerations of Open
     Hardware. The LLW provided workshops on improving the quality of
     Free Software licensing information, including those specific to
     copyleft licenses. As with all online discussions of the Legal
     Network and its associated events, the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule">Chatham
     House Rule</a> applied to this year's edition of the LLW.
     Next year we plan to organise LLW again as a physical meeting to
     continue building a robust Free Software legal community.

  </figure>

  <p>
  2021 marks the 3rd and final year of FSFE's involvement in the
  European Commission's Next Generation Internet Zero Initiative. Our
  work <a href="/news/2021/news-20210504-01.html">has been
  praised</a>  by the European Commission and the projects which we
  have been working with.  The FSFE has been a partner organisation
  of <a href="/activities/ngi/index.html">Next Generation Internet
  Zero (NGI0)</a>.
  </p>

 <blockquote>
    <p>
    “Our Free Software developer needs were understood and met with
    minimal frictions. With audits, this NGI0 support went further
    than just allowing us to spend more time working on the project,
    they taught us how to improve it. The FSFE REUSE team even
    contributed actual code with a regular merge-request, in a
    perfect illustration of ‘them’ teaming up with us!”
    </p>
    <p>
    Simon Descarpentires, <a href="https://www.meta-press.es/">Meta-Press.es Project</a>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

    <h3 id="assistance-ngi0">Supporting Free Software Developers Through NGI0</h3>

  <p>
    The FSFE  provided guidance on how to communicate the components,
    licences, and copyrights associated with software packages. We
    assisted software projects with their legal and licensing needs,
    and convinced them to adopt our REUSE standards as best practices
    for displaying licensing and copyright information.
  </p>

  <p>
   We have guided over 100 NGI0 software projects to implement the
   REUSE standards on their workflow. This has included working
   directly with their repositories to better improve how the
   licensing and copyright information contained in their
   repositories is displayed, so that any adopters of their work in
   the future can more easily comply with these licence and
   copyright obligations.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
    "Regarding REUSE, we have learnt a lot. We realise that the
    idea behind REUSE is simple, clear, and powerful. Nowadays,
    Free Software projects become more and more complicated, and
    many components/files of a single project have different
    license/copyright information. REUSE helps a lot on tracking
    the status of this information in our project.”

<h3 id="ngi0-reuse">Making Copyright and Licensing Easier for Everyone</h3>

  <p>
    Together with another NGI0 partner organisation, the <a href="https://www.ifross.org/">Institute for Legal Issues
    regarding Free and Open Source Software, or ifrOSS</a>, we have
    included in our website a set of educational FAQs about Free
    Software legal and licensing issues. These <a href="/freesoftware/legal/faq.html">FAQs</a> tackle topics
    useful to any Free Software developer, such as the <a href="/freesoftware/legal/faq.html#copyright">basics of
    copyright</a>, <a href="/freesoftware/legal/faq.html#license">licensing issues
    with Free Software</a>, and issues with <a href="/freesoftware/legal/faq.html#compatibility">licence
    compatibility</a>. In total, we have created <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/NGI0/V2/">eight educational PDF
    documents</a> that explain these topics more, in greater depth.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
    "Being involved in NGI0 has been a nurturing experience. On one
    hand, it has been very interesting to work closely with and
    learn from projects that are reshaping the future of the
    internet. On the other, being part of the FSFE team has
    provided me with the necessary technical and legal skills to
    feel comfortable to contribute directly to projects'
    repositories through merge-requests; a task that was completely
    new for me in the beginning. All the positive feedback from
    these projects only encourages me to keep up the good
    work.”</p>

<h3 id="fosdem-devroom">1. Co-organising FOSDEM Legal and Policy devroom</h3>

  <p>
    On February 2021, the FSFE participated in <a href="/news/2021/news-20210311-01.html">FOSDEM</a>. This year it
    took place online, and according to the main FOSDEM organisers it
    had a peak of 33,600 attendees. Also, the FSFE co-organised the
    Legal and Policy Devroom for the first time.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the Legal and Policy Devroom we aimed to cover the most
    crucial current issues, such as the proprietary software
    monopolies which were formed within the rapid digitization after
    the outbreak of the pandemic. This issue was also related to the
    intentional <a href="/news/2020/news-20200330-01.html">misuse of
    the term Free Software</a> for marketing purposes. The
    panels covered three ongoing EU policies, the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/ecoss/"> 'Open Source
    strategy'</a>, the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/digitalmarketsact/">Digital

<h3 id="podcast">2. Publishing podcast episodes</h3>

  <p>
    In addition to our regular news stories and monthly newsletter,
    the FSFE regularly publishes the Software Freedom Podcast. We
    talk once a month with people deeply involved in software freedom. Podcasts facilitate community building around
    Free Software. In 2021 we created five new episodes: <a href="/news/podcast/episode-12.html"> "Enforcement of the
    GNU GPL" with Till Jaeger</a>, <a href="/news/podcast/episode-11.html">"REUSE Booster and our
    update on REUSE" with Max Mehl</a>, <a href="/news/podcast/episode-10.html">"How to support Free
    Software and a sustainable digital infrastructure" with
    Elisa Lindinger</a>, <a href="/news/podcast/episode-9.html">"I love Free
    Software"</a>, and <a href="/news/podcast/episode-8.html">"How to tell my mother
    that Free Software can cost money?"</a>.
  </p>

<h3 id="further-outreach">3. Thanking creators behind Free Software</h3>

  <p>
    Free Software often benefits from the generous work of individuals
    who work to develop and maintain Free Software
    projects. By making software available to everyone, they help us
    chat with our friends in privacy, share our notes, save our
    passwords -- you name it! Their valuable contributions should not
    go unnoticed. In the FSFE we celebrate 'I Love Free Software
    Day ' every 14 February thanking creators of Free Software
    and we invite others to join us in doing so. Our <a href="/news/2021/news-20210317-01.html">I Love Free Software Day
    2021</a> received a lot of attention. We counted 411 tweets on
    Twitter and 210 toots in the Fediverse using the hashtag
    #ilovefs. People from all over the world joined I Love Free
    Software Day via social media and tweeted and tooted from at
    least 328 different places.

    identifies as female build connections with each other while
    discussing technological issues. Starting out as a
    German-speaking group, the FSFE Women turned to English in May to
    welcome new members from around Europe. FSFE Women meets every
    month online and covers aspects related to Free Software. In June
    2021, Irmhild Rogalla gave a talk about the accessibility of
    video conferencing tools, supporting a conferencing platform for
    all. In July 2021, Bonnie Mehring presented 'Public Money? Public
    Code!' in relation to the German elections. In August 2021, Loria
    presented how maps are created in a 2D workadventu.re world. <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Women">FSFE Women</a> is open

  <p>
    Besides its dedicated volunteers, the FSFE also relies on its
    employees for its daily operations. At the FSFE we currently have 7 people working full-time, 5 working part-time, and 2 interns.
  </p>

  <p>
  In 2021 we welcomed 6 new staffers. Since November 2020, Linda Wagener completes
  bookkeeping and accounting tasks, offering a helping hand when
  needed. Lina Ceballos completed her internship in the FSFE last year,
  and she has now joined our permanent
  team. Lina is a Project Manager focusing on PMPC, REUSE, and Router
  Freedom. Also, she helps the FSFE to reach our Spanish-language audience.
  </p>
  <p>
  Linus Sehn is our new System Administrator; he makes sure our
  systems run smoothly and solves any problems that come up. Since
  May 2021, Fani Partsafyllidou has been our new Project Manager and
  Newsletter Editor, supporting the implementation of Youth Hacking 4
  Freedom, 20 Years FSFE, and Upcycling Android. Fani makes sure that
  the work of the FSFE is accurately communicated to our community.
  </p>
  <p>
  In September 2021, Marlene Kietreiber joined our team and brings
  the magic of graphic design to the FSFE. At the same time,
  Niharika Singhal joined our Legal team as an intern. Would you like to join our team? We are always interested in <a href="/about/jobs/internship.html">internship applications</a>.
  </p>

<h3 id="ga">The General Assembly guides the progress of the FSFE</h3>

  <p>
  The FSFE is governed by its formal members, the <a href="/about/people/index.html#general-assembly">"General
  Assembly"</a>, who are responsible for planning, budgeting,
  and setting the agenda, as well as electing the Executive Council
  which currently consists of the FSFE's President Matthias
  Kirschner, Vice-President Heiki Löhmus, and Financial Officer
  Patrick Ohnewein.
  </p>

  <p>
  The FSFE complies with the guidelines set out in <a href="https://www.transparency.de/Initiative-Transparente-Zivilg.1612.0.html">“transparent
  civil society” by Transparency International Germany</a> with <a href="/about/transparency-commitment.html">our transparency
  commitment</a>. Besides our constitution and minutes from our
  general assemblies, you will find information in our general
  reports, name and functions of decision makers and staff, our
  connections with other organisations, <a href="/about/funds/funds.html">how we use our money</a>, and <a href="/donate/thankgnus.html">who our donors are</a>.
  </p>

    <h3 id="spreading-the-word">Spreading the word</h3>

  <p>
    We offer gratis <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword">information
    packages</a>, so that people can raise awareness about software
    freedom in their communities. From 1 November 2020 until now we
    have sent 263 information packages. Thank you to all of you who
    spread the news and help us to reach more people about Free
    Software. The FSFE <a href="/order/">T-shirt collection</a> is
    beloved; we have sold 700 T-shirts since 1 November 2020. Also,
    we introduced two new products to celebrate 20 Years of the FSFE:
    a bag, which you can see below, and a sticker.
  </p>

  <h2 id="join">Join our movement</h2>

  <p>
    In the last few years, we exceeded ten thousand people from
    Europe and beyond who are supporting our cause by <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword">spreading our word</a>, signing
    our open letters, subscribing to our <a href="/contact/email-updates.html">community mails</a> and <a href="/news/newsletter.html">newsletter</a>, or joining our <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/postorius/lists/discussion.lists.fsfe.org">public
    discussions</a>. If you ever wondered who all these people are
    and what a FSFE supporter looks like, we have created a dedicated
    <a href="/about/people/testimonials">testimonials page</a> for
    you, where several of our supporters have left a quote, an
    interview, or a video.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The FSFE would be nothing without our contributors. And
    it would be so much more with you!</strong> If you feel inspired
    after reading our report, there are many ways to engage in our
    movement. We have a dedicated <a href="/contribute">contribution
    page</a> to help you find a way that best fits your interests and
    skills.
  </p>

  <p>
  One of the easiest entrance levels is to spread the word about Free
  Software in public or among your friends with our <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword">promotion material</a> or directly
  show your love for Free Software by wearing <a href="/order/index.html">some of our inspiring merchandise
  items</a>. Follow and share our <a href="/events/events.html">event
  announcements</a>, find an event that fits your interests, and then
  go there to meet like-minded people. Don't be shy; most of us
  have been in your position once.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you find no event near you, you can also join us online. If
    you want to contribute with your <a href="/contribute/web/web.html">IT skills</a> or your <a href="/contribute/translators/translators.html">language
    skills</a>, you are more than welcome to join our respective
    online teams. Not yet sure where to start? Then look into <a href="https://community.fsfe.org/">our discourse-instance</a> and
    start to get to know our community and get inspired about what
    you can do.
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Finally, advocating for freedom also costs money and we depend on
  people like you to <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/support">support us
  financially</a>. All support is used to improve European software
  freedom a little more each day, step by step, bit by bit.</strong>
  </p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward to 2022</h2>

  <p>
  In 2022, the FSFE will continue its activities while undertaking
  new ones. The following paragraphs are not an exhaustive account of
  our future activities, but a glimpse of what is coming up.
  </p>

  <p>
  In 2022 we are going to monitor the implementation of our PMPC
  demands, protect Router Freedom in countries where the respective
  legislation is coming up, and advocate to prevent a Radio Lockdown.
  We plan to have a physical Legal and Licensing Workshop 2022 in
  Gothenburg, Sweden, and will continuously evaluate the current
  conditions there to ensure the safety of all participants. We are
  currently preparing two exciting projects for the next year, Youth
  Hacking 4 Freedom and Upcycling Android.
  </p>

  <p>
   <a href="https://yh4f.org">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</a> is a coding competition to inspire young
   people to Software Freedom. It is open to teenagers 14-18
   from around Europe. Participants will compete in Youth Hacking for
   Freedom by creating programs of their choice licensed as Free
   Software. This hacking competition is a great opportunity for
   young people to receive inspiration and to network with important
   people of the field. For the winners, the cash prize might turn
   into an investment for their own project.
  </p>

  <p>
  Upcycling Android will be a campaign with a web presence and
  practical workshops to overcome software obsolescence on Android by
  installing Free Software. It will aim to achieve users' freedom and
  care for the environment at the same time.
  </p>

  <p>
     Overall, the next year
  of the FSFE is exciting and promising as we plan to reach out to a
  younger audience and to highlight the importance of software
  sustainability. If you are interested in following our future projects
  make sure you <a href="/contact/email-updates.html">subscribe</a> to our mail updates.
