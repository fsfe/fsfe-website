      The ultimate book about the Covid-19 plague will describe how Open
      Standards and Free Software saved civilisation. Government, business, and
      education only stay operational by going remote. Remoting hundreds of
      millions is possible only possible through Open Standards with high
      quality Free Software implementations; ditto building scalable data
      centres around elastic clouds. There are profound economic, social, even
      public health learnings here. The continuing mission of FSFE is important
      to tackle the issues ahead of us.
