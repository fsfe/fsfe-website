    <description>
      Device Neutrality is the policy concept to regulate monopoly over
      devices and re-establish end-user control over their digital equipment.
      The Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulates the economic activity of large
      digital platforms and introduces Device Neutrality in the EU
      legislation, fostering access to Free Sofware in Devices.
