<h1 class="painted">Open letter for the right to install any software on any device</h1>

<h2 id="the-universal-right-to-freely-choose-operating-systems-software-and-services">The universal right to freely choose operating systems, software and services</h2>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Software design is crucial for the ecodesign and sustainability of 
    products and hardware. Free Software systems and services enable 
    reuse, repurposing and interoperability of devices. The universal 
    right to freely choose operating systems, software and services is 
    crucial for a more sustainable digital society.
  </p>
</blockquote>  
  
  <p>
    The ongoing digitization of infrastructures and services comes 
    along with a continuously  growing number of electronic devices 
    that are connected to the Internet - be it in private, public or 
    business environments. Many of these devices need more energy and 
    natural resources to be produced than the energy they consume 
    during their entire lifespan. And way too many of these devices are 
    being wasted and not reparable simply because the software stops 
    working or is not being updated anymore.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Once the pre-installed software stops users from continuing to use 
    their hardware, restrictive ownership models prevent users from 
    helping themselves to enjoy longer use of their devices. 
    Restrictions span from physically locking down hardware, to 
    technical obscurity by using proprietary software, to legal 
    restrictions via software licenses and end user license agreements. 
    This way, manufacturers often prohibit repairability, access and 
    reuse of their devices. Even after  purchase, customers often do 
    not really own their devices. They are not able to do what they 
    want with their very own devices. <strong>If you cannot install the 
    software you want on your own device – you don’t own it.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    We, the signees of this open letter,
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      recognize that free access to the hardware and software determines how long or how often a device can be used or reused.
    </li>
    <li>
      declare the increased longevity and reusability of our devices to be inevitable for a more sustainable digital society.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    That is why we ask legislators around Europe to make use of the 
    historic chance and enable a more sustainable use of electronic 
    products and devices with a universal right to install and run any 
    software on any device. To this end, we demand that:
  </p>

<h2 id="users-have-the-right-to-freely-choose-operating-systems-and-software-running-on-their-devices">Users have the right to freely choose operating systems and software running on their devices</h2>

  <p>
    Our tablets, phones and other connected devices are general purpose 
    computers. Replacing software and operating systems on these 
    devices enables us to extend the initial lifespan of a device and 
    to make full use of our hardware. For the ability to reuse and 
    repurpose our resources in a creative and sustainable way we need 
    <strong>the universal right to install and develop any operating 
    system and software we want on any of our devices.</strong> Any 
    legal, technical or other obstacles to reuse these devices for any 
    purpose must not be allowed.
  </p>

<h2 id="users-have-the-right-to-freely-choose-between-service-providers-to-connect-their-devices-with">Users have the right to freely choose between service providers to connect their devices with</h2>
  
  <p>
    Users must have the free choice of providers offering software 
    related services, meaning they can use the device from one 
    manufacturer with the service provided by another. Many connected 
    clients today go to waste simply because their online services go 
    offline. Free choice of services allows these clients to be reused 
    by connecting to another service.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Operating systems and embedded software determine possible 
    interactions between generic sensors, modules and systems with 
    their connected online services. For users to exercise free choice 
    of services, they must be able to use the device from one 
    manufacturer with any online service, which could be supplied by 
    any other third party or by themselves. <strong>Connected services 
    as well as the software on connected devices and applications must 
    offer interoperability and full functionality of a device&#39;s 
    initial purpose with the use of Open Standards.</strong>
  </p>

<h2 id="devices-are-interoperable-and-compatible-with-open-standards">Devices are interoperable and compatible with open standards</h2>
  
  <p>
    Software designs and architectures determine accessibility and 
    compatibility of hardware via standards, drivers, tools, and 
    interfaces. Proprietary software and protocols hinder competition 
    among manufacturers, undermine repairability of devices and create 
    an artificial incompatibility of different devices within the same 
    infrastructure. Interoperability of single devices however is 
    crucial for the creation of sufficient, sustainable and 
    long-lasting IT infrastructures. To enable interoperability, 
    <strong>manufacturers must ensure that any data necessary to run a 
    device&#39;s primary function is compatible with and possible to 
    import/export in open standards.</strong>
  </p>

<h2 id="source-code-of-drivers-tools-and-interfaces-are-published-under-a-free-license">Source code of drivers, tools, and interfaces are published under a free license</h2>
  
  <p>
    Smaller components of a device often require specific drivers, 
    tools, and interfaces to operate. Users need full access and free 
    reusability of the source code of those drivers, tools, and 
    interfaces to analyse and integrate a device within a set of 
    interconnected devices from different manufacturers. Source code 
    reusability is also key to exercise the full right to repair for 
    any third-parties from professional repair shops to repair cafés to 
    end users.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A free license is any license that gives everyone the four freedoms 
    to use, study, share and improve the software, including Free 
    Software and Open Source Software licenses. <strong>The obligation 
    to publish drivers, tools, and interfaces under such a free license 
    after market entry are key for full access to our devices and 
    exercising the universal right to repair.</strong>
