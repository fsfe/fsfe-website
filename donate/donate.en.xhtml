        The Free Software Foundation Europe is a non-profit non-governmental
        organisation. <a href="/work.html">Our work</a> is made
        possible by a community of
        <a href="/contribute/contribute.html">volunteers</a>,
        <a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org">Fellows</a> and
        <a href="thankgnus.html">donors</a>. Your donations are critical to our
        strength and autonomy. They enable us to continue working for Free
        Software wherever necessary, and to be an independent voice.

    <h2>What happens next</h2>

    <p>
      If you donate more than 480 Euro in a year, we would like to add your
      name to our <a href="thankgnus.html">donors list</a>. For online
      donations, you can use the checkbox "I want to remain anonymous" to
      indicate whether or not being listed there is ok with you. If you send
      your donation by bank transfer, please
      <a href="mailto:office@fsfeurope.org">contact us</a> about this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, you can include our
      <a href="/about/graphics/sponsoring/sponsoring.html">Sponsoring buttons</a>
      on your own web page to show your support for us.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some countries, donations to us can be deducted from income tax.
      Currently, this is the case in <a href="germany.html">Germany</a>, the
      <a href="netherlands.html">Netherlands</a>, and
      <a href="switzerland.html">Switzerland</a>.
