    <h1>Policy overview - FSFE</h1>

    <div id="introduction">
		<p>
			Free Software - computer programs which anyone can use, study, share, and improve - is crucial for building a free information society. Free Software powers the Internet and provides the foundation for most successful businesses in the information technology industry. Only with Free Software can users fully understand what a computer program actually does, which data it sends where, and how it generates its results.

			<h3>Such thematic...</h3>
			<h4>Procurement</h4>
			<p>Free Software is a perfect fit for the public sector. It brings efficiency to government, transparency to citizens, and competition to business. FSFE works with public bodies throughout Europe to improve public IT procurement and open up opportunities for Free Software. </p>
			
			<h4>Open Standards</h4>
			<p>Open Standards allow people to share all kinds of data freely and with perfect fidelity. They prevent lock-in and other artificial barriers to interoperability, and promote choice between vendors and technology solutions. FSFE's work on Open Standards has the goal of making sure that people find it easy to migrate to Free Software or between Free Software solutions. </p>
			
			<h4>Software Patents</h4>
			<p>Software patents are a menace to society and economy. They restrict innovation, damage businesses and put collaborative creativity in great danger. FSFE fights to keep Europe free of software patents, and works at the UN level to abolish software patents around the world. </p>
