<h1>Spread your concern about Free Software funding in your local newspaper</h1>

<p>Are you also worried and concerned about the European Commission 
decision to cut the funding for Free Software projects? Besides 
contacting European representatives you can also write a letter to the 
editor of your local newspaper to make their readers aware of the 
importance of funding Free Software solutions with a long term 
sustainable funding.</p>

<p>As stated in our recent news, <a href="/news/2024/news-20240719-01.html">the European Commission has 
decided  
to cut the funding for Free Software in the Next Generation Internet 
Initiative (NGI)</a> 2025 Horizon draft work programme. Since then, we have 
raised our voice about this issue. But we need your help to continue 
put pressure on the European Commission. <a href="/news/2024/news-20240808-01.html">Your pressure already 
helped!</a> 
Let’s continue the efforts!</p>

<h3>Budget cut in contrast to digital strategy</h3> 

<p>Since 2018, the European Commission has been supporting the Free 
Software ecosystem through  the NGI initiative as part of Horizon 
Europe, the framework research program of the EU. This funding provided 
support and technical assistance to Free Software projects, that have 
turned out to be useful and a way to provide alternatives to 
proprietary applications. Funding is an important component in 
nurturing new Free Software technologies, and often makes the 
difference for whether a Free Software project is able to survive, 
succeed, or fall into abandonware. This is a particular problem because 
large parts of our infrastructure are based on these projects, as they 
guarantee the necessary independence and resilience. Cancelling funding 
means curtailing our own autonomy.</p>

<p>This decision to cut the funds has been taken from the European 
Commission in a non transparent and unclear way. This  budget cut for 
Free Software Freedom by the European Commission is in explicit 
contrast to their digital strategy. A true open and digital independent 
Europe is possible only with a long term sustainable funding scheme for 
software freedom.</p>

<h3>Your pressure helped – let’s continue</h3>

<p>
In a <a href="/news/2024/news-20240808-01.html">committed and 
community-driven reaction</a>, the FSFE community reached out to the EU 
institutions and <a href="/news/2024/news-20240808-01.html">the Head of 
Unit of Next Generation Internet (DG CNECT) answered</a>. However, the 
EC’s answer we received is vague and with no clear information on how 
Software Freedom will be supported by the European Union in the future. 
That is why we still ned your help!
</p>

<p>
It is important to keep the pressure high and your support is crucial in 
doing that. In order to make even more people aware of this situation, 
you can send a letter to your local newspaper explaining them what has 
happened until now and why the European Commission needs to come up with 
sustainable long-term funding for Software Freedom.

<blockquote>
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>I would like to draw attention to the recent news that the European 
Commission is stopping its  funding for Free Software (also known as 
Open Source).</p>

<p>Although we do not notice, our daily devices are running using Free 
Software, guarantees the freedoms to use, study, share and improve the 
software by everyone. Thanks to these freedoms, it  ensures that 
citizens, businesses and governments are not dependent on proprietary 
software solutions, which often come with significant costs and 
limitations. Free Software is at the core of our digital infrastructure 
and it strengthen local economies and foster innovation.</p>

<p>Despite its proven success, the European Commission  has decided to 
stop supporting Free Software by cutting its funding for the Next 
Generation Internet initiative (NGI) for the next period of Horizon 
Europe. This goes against its own  strategy to achieve  a digital future 
that is open, fair and sustainable. So, being Free Software essential to 
reach this goal, why are our politicians only supporting it through nice 
wording and not with a proper budget? Hundreds of Free Software projects 
will struggle if the funding is not resumed and the internet of the 
future will look less open and accessible to everyone.</p> 

<p>The European Commission should come up with a dedicated funding 
programme for Software Freedom, so that the Next Generation Internet the 
the European digital infrastructure is independent, sustainable and 
accessible to everyone.</p>

<p>Your name</p>
