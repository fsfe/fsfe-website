        <h2>Administrative Support</h2>

        <p>
          We can help <a href="contact.html">answer questions</a> about
          Free Software license adoption or use. Our services in this
          area range from describing the type of formal structures that
          can make using code easier through to assisting with community
          relations or resolving issues with incompliant code.  We can also
          help you find legal and technical experts to provide specialised
          services when necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          While we are happy to provide some gratis advice to Free Software
          projects and businesses engaging with Free Software, we ask that
          you <a href="http://fsfe.org/donate/donate.html">make a donation</a>
          to help us provide this service to all.
        </p>

        <h2>Fiduciary License Agreement</h2>

        <p>
          We make a specialised copyright assignment document called the
          <a href="fla.html">Fiduciary License Agreement</a> (FLA) available
          to the community at large.  The FLA allows one entity to
          safeguard all of the code created for a project by consolidating
          copyright (or exclusive exploitation rights).  We can assist
          projects or business adapt and adopt it for their own use.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also use the FLA for our own <a
            href="http://www.fsfe.org/projects/ftf/fiduciary.en.html">Fiduciary
            Programme</a>.  This allows projects to assign copyright to
          FSFE, and FSFE then deals with any legal issues that occur for that
          project.  This frees up developers to focus on coding great new
          solutions.
