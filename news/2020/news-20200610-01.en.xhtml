		<h1>Hamburg wants to focus more on Free Software</h1>
		
    <p>In Hamburg, the SPD and the Greens are stating in their coalition
    agreement to focus more on Free Software during their future term.  The
    FSFE welcomes this step and will critically monitor its implementation.</p>
		
    <p>In order to strengthen digital sovereignty of Hamburg, the city wants to
    use more Free Software in the future <a
    href="https://www.spd-hamburg.de/fileadmin-hamburg/user_upload/Koalitionsvertrag2020.pdf">(see
    the PDF of the coalition agreement)</a>. The goal is to minimise the
    dependence on individual providers and create transparency. Wherever it
    appears meaningful, cooperation with other administrations should be
    established. However, the coalition agreement contains several loopholes,
    for example for procurement procedures and diffuse justification to protect
    proprietary software vendors.</p>
		
    <blockquote>Alexander Sander, the FSFE's Policy Manager, explains: "We are
    pleased that Hamburg has recognised the problems associated with the use of
    proprietary software and wants to focus more on the use of Free Software.
    However, the exceptions in the coalition agreement indicate at this point
    in time that the implementation could lead to problems and counteracting
    the goals. We will critically monitor the process and demand that first
    steps be taken quickly to make software developed with public money
    available to the general public. If it is public money, it should be public
    code as well."</blockquote>

    <p>Free Software gives everyone the right to use, understand, distribute
    and improve software for any purpose. Administrations also benefit from
    these freedoms when they rely on Free Software. More and more
    administrations all over Europe are using and developing Free Software in
    order to benefit from interoperable solutions, to avoid vendor lock ins, to
    be transparent and sovereign, to spend funds in the most efficient way and
    to foster innovation and collaboration.</p>

    <p>As part of the "Public Money?  Public Code!" campaign, FSFE is
    specifically campaigning for a change in policy towards Free Software. The
    "Public Money? Public Code!" initiative aims to set Free Software as the
    standard for publicly financed software.  The Free Software Foundation
    Europe together with over 180 civil society organisations and more than
    27.000 individuals signed the open letter. We will use the signatures to
    contact decision makers and political representatives all over Europe and
    convince them to make public code the standard. You are invited to add your
    signature to make a bigger impact on <a
