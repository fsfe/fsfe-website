    <!-- please have a look at https://fsfe.org/about/mission for existing translations -->

      <p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to
      control technology.</p>

      <p>Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives; and it is
      important that this technology empowers rather than restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the
      rights to use, understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support
      other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.</p>
