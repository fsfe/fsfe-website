        <title>The Next Generation Internet and Free Software in Aveiro, Portugal</title>

    <body>
      <p>What will the Internet of the future look like? The  Next Generation Internet Initiative (NGI) envisions an Internet that is accessible and diverse, and respects the fundamental value of privacy. Here at the FSFE, we believe that Free Software is key to accomplish this vision, so that all people, regardless of their background, are able to use the Internet as an effective tool to achieve their full potential. This talk will go over the NGI initiative and will present the funding opportunities for Free Software projects engaged in changing the landscape of the Internet of the future.</p>
      <p>Lucas Lasota, FSFE's Programme Manager Legal, will speak at Festa do Software Livre in Aveiro, Portugal, about NGI. The talk takes place on 16.09. The language is Portuguese. The event is free and requires no registration.<br />
