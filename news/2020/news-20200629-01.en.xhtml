<h1>Denmark keeps source code of Coronavirus tracing app secret</h1>

<p>
  Like many other European countries, Denmark also tries to track
  Sars-CoV-2 infections with a mobile phone tracing app. However,
  against advice by health organisations and despite positive examples
  by other countries, the app is proprietary, so not being released
  under a Free Software (also called Open Source) license.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://smittestop.dk/spoergsmaal-og-svar">Smittestop</a>,
  the official tracing app released by the Danish government, is
  supposed to supplement the more traditional ways of combatting the
  Coronavirus with contact tracing. But instead of releasing the source
  code of the app under a <a href="/freesoftware/">Free Software</a>
  license and thereby empowering the public as well as the scientific
  community to inspect, verify, improve and experiment with it, the
  app's source code is kept hidden.
</p>

<p>
  This goes directly against the most recent <a
  href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/332200/WHO-2019-nCoV-Ethics_Contact_tracing_apps-2020.1-eng.pdf">recommendations
  from the WHO</a> as well as the EU Commision's eHealth network. In
  the referenced paper, the WHO specifically states that:
</p>

<blockquote>
 "There should be full transparency about how the applications and
 application programming interfaces (APIs) operate, and publication of
 open source and open access codes. Individuals should also be provided
 with meaningful information about the existence of automated
 decision-making and how risk predictions are made, including how the
 algorithmic model was developed and the data used to train the model.
 Furthermore, there should be information about the model's utility and
 insights as to the types of errors that such a model may make."
</blockquote>

<p>
  Had the Danish government published the source code under a Free
  Software license, such transparency would have been provided to the
  public, and scientists and IT experts would have been able to peer
  review and improve the app's error margins, possibly helping
  interrupt more chains of infection.

<p>
  On the app's homepage, the Danish government explains that the source
  code is not being published because of the risk of "security
  breaches" and to protect the public against malicious actors.
  However, IT security does not arise through an attackers' ignorance
  of the system under attack, but due to a proper and well-reviewed
  security design (also read p.22 in our <a
  href="https://fsfe.org/campaigns/publiccode/brochure">expert
  publication</a>). This decision, if anything, makes the app less
  secure – not more. Moreover, since the app is decentralised and is
  wired to nemID, the official Danish digital signature, security
  breaches are unlikely to occur.
</p>

<p>
  Such false security concerns have not stopped the governments of <a
  href="https://github.com/corona-warn-app">Germany</a>, <a
  href="https://github.com/austrianredcross">Austria</a>, <a
  href="https://github.com/immuni-app/">Italy</a> and <a
  href="https://github.com/nhsx/">Great Britain</a> from complying with
  the WHO's and the EU Commission's transparency requirements and
  publish their contact tracing apps under a Free Software license. In
  fact, Germany, Austria and Italy all quoted security as one of the
  main points in favour of publishing the source code.
</p>

<p>
  The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) strongly urges the Danish
  government to immediately rectify this situation and publish its
  "Smittestop" app under a Free Software license, with the source code
  fully available to the public.
