Jörg Tauss - chairman of the German Parliamentary Commission on the New Media

 In the circles of technological policy experts, you can often here people asserting that the patent system must be extended to certain areas of information technology, whose investments would otherwise not be sufficiently protected. This assertion has however until now always been touted like a self-evident truth, and nobody I know of ever cared to substantiate it in the light of facts from the German or European IT economy.

Even if the patent advocates succeeded in finding areas of information technology, in which patents are having or have had some positive effects, it would nonetheless still be necessary to investigate, whether these effects are not outweighed by possible detrimental side-effects of the patent system.

But while the legislative authorities are still completely clueless on this matter, the judicial authorities are already taking action, granting thousands of software patents and pressing for a change of the legal rules. We as legislators should therefore now take up these questions with highest priority.

Gilles Savary - Député Européen (France) 

Je pense que nous devons distinguer les concepts de droits d'auteur
des concepts de brevetabilité. Les droits d'auteur peuvent à la limite
se concevoir, car ils sont la rémunératon d'une création et de sa
diffusion; la brevetabilité est au contraire l'appropriation privée
d'une diffusion qui est une diffusion extrêmement encadrée et donc
privative pour le plus grand nombre.
