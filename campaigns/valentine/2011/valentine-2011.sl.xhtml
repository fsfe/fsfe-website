<p id="introduction"> Valentine's Day is a celebration of love, and
  it's a great day to declare your love and gratitude to the people
  behind every <a href="/about/basics/freesoftware.html">Free
  Software</a> initiative and organisation. Why not make this February
  14th a very special day and show them that you appreciate their
  work?</p>

<identica/>

<h2>Time to go public</h2> 

<!-- only one sentence added compared to last year's "this time it's personal" -->
<p>Behind every Free Software initiative and organisation are real, passionate
hard-working people. Show them that you appreciate their work – it could make
all the difference! Some Free Software advocates have already told us <a href="#testimonials">why they love Free Software</a>. Come and follow their example, declare your love to Free Software!</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to declare one's love... Here are some ideas on how you can go public and proclaim your love to Free Software.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Send active Free Software supporters a message thanking them for their work</li>
  <li>Microblog about how you love Free Software, and tag those messages with <!-- [dont't translate the comment] link either to http://identi.ca/ilovefs or to the agregation of dents underneath--> <strong><a href="http://identi.ca/ilovefs">#ilovefs</a></strong>. </li>
  <li>Hug a developer (ask permission first!)</li>
  <li>Buy your favourite developer a drink. Or buy someone else a drink and while savouring it, tell him/her about your favorite Free Software application!</li>
  <li><a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/mk/?p=399">Send a book to your favourite contributor</a> and <a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/SupportPrograms">support FSFE</a> at the same time.</li>
</ul>

   <!--

<h2><span><a name="testimonials">Why they love Free Software</a></span></h2>
<div class="testimonial">
<img src="/about/oberg/avatar.jpg"/>
<p>"On Valentines Day, the Society for Free Culture and Software, extends their
love to projects such as Audacity, GIMP, Inkscape and other audiovisual tools.
These tools form the backbone of the infrastructure needed to support free
culture and while Free Culture could technically exist independently of Free
Software, the two movements share a common philosophy of freedom which make the
two inseparable.  Without Free Software, our activities would be so much more
difficult to carry out, and no Free Culture project would be able to enjoy the
full freedoms without the infrastructure created by Free Software projects such
as those outlined before. To everyone engaged in supporting this
infrastructure: thank you! We love you!"<br/>
— <strong>Jonas Oberg, <a href="http://www.ffkp.se/">Society for Free Culture and Software (Föreningen fri kultur och programvara)</a></strong></p>

<div class="testimonial">
<img src="/campaigns/valentine/2011/Cornelius-Schumacher.jpg"/>
<p>Free Software is central to everything KDE does and without Free Software KDE  
software could not exist.<br/>

KDE relies overwhelmingly on volunteer contributions from people all around 
the world who, initially, do not know one another. Free Software provides the 
social contract that makes such contributions possible, as our volunteers know 
they are helping to create a common good that can be shared by all.<br/>

Free Software and the shared purpose it creates also gives KDE its distinctive  
non-hierarchical meritocratic structure. Without the principles of Free 
Software, KDE would need centralised control of the software copyrights and, 
in turn, a set of leaders determining the direction of the software we 
produce. Our contributors would have less ability to try out new ideas, to 
work on the things that really matter to them and, above all, to be Free.<br/>

Without Free Software, there would be no KDE. Free Software gives KDE life. 
KDE loves Free Software.<br/>
— <strong>Cornelius Schumacher, <a href="http://ev.kde.org">President of KDE e.V.</a></strong> </p>

<img src="/campaigns/valentine/2011/massimo_barbieri120.jpg"/>
<p>"A few decades ago the word "Freedom" had a very different meaning than
today. We live in a digital society in which many aspects of our lives,
and of our Freedom, go through a digital medium. Having full control of
the software we use is therefore the only way to achieve full control of
our Freedom. I love Free Software because I take care of my Freedom."<br/>
