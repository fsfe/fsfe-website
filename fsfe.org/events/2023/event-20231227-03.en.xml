        <title>FSFE at the 37C3 in Hamburg</title>

    <body>
	    <p>For the 37th Chaos Communication Congress (37C3) the FSFE is part of this year's Bits &amp; BÃ¤ume cluster. Together with many other organisations is the FSFE creating a space that welcomes all creatures! At our assembly we create a common space for FSFE members, friends, and supporters to discuss, meet, hack, and organise. Whether you're a Free Software enthusiast or simply enjoy the company of friendly geeks, our assembly welcomes all creatures. Join us to engage in lively discussions, collaborate on projects, and connect with a diverse community passionate about technology and the values of Free Software. Service announcement: Everyday at 7 pm we sing the Free Software Song at the FSFE booth.</p>
