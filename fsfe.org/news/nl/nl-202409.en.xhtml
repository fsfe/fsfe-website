<h1>Apple litigation +++ EU funding for Free Software +++ YH4F +++ ZOOOM project</h1>

<p>
September is here, along with our newsletter. We have continued 
advocating for a Free Software budget in Europe, following the European 
Commission's decision to stop NGI funding, and we are intervening in 
Apple's lawsuit against the European Commission. YH4F got a new sponsor 
and its 2024 edition is in the final stage, and the ZOOOM project 
ended.

	<blockquote>
		<p>“The lack of public funding for these important technologies 
		has a negative impact not only on free software, but on the entire 
		future of the internet."</p> <cite>FSFE statement about EC plans to cut 
		funding on Free Software projects in <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Criticism-programmed-EU-cuts-funding-for-free-software-and-the-open-web-9841882.html">Heise.de</a></cite>

	<h3 id="Apple-EC">Apple vs EU Commission: the FSFE intervenes to safeguard Free Software</h3> 

	<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe <a href="/news/2024/news-20240812-01.html">is intervening in 
	litigation brought by Apple against the European Commission</a> before the 
	Court of Justice of the European Union. Apple is seeking to avoid DMA 
	obligations related to its App Store and the interoperability of its 
	operating system. The FSFE aims to protect Free Software against 
	monopolistic corporate control.</p> 

	<h3 id="NGI-funding">European Commission needs to come up with 
	dedicated budget for Free Software solutions</h3> 

	<p>After the recent news that <a href="/news/2024/news-20240719-01.html">funding for the Next Generation 
	Internet initiative would be 
	cut</a> for the next phase of Horizon Europe, the European Commission has 
	expressed <a href="/news/2024/news-20240808-01.html">vague support for 
	Free Software</a>. Unfortunately it is failing 
	to provide concrete examples on how to do so. This has highlighted the 
	fragility of funding for Software Freedom and the need for change in 
	the long-term.</p> 


	<h3 id="take-action">Spread your concern about Free Software funding</h3>

	<p>Are you also worried and concerned about the European Commission 
	decision to cut the funding for Free Software projects?</p>

	<p>Besides <a href="/news/nl/nl-202408.html#take-action">contacting 
	European representatives</a>, you can also <a href="/news/2024/news-20240828-01.html">write a letter to the 
	editor of your local newspaper</a> to make their readers aware of the 
	importance of funding Free Software solutions with long term 
	sustainable funding.</p>

	<h3 id="YH4F">YH4F countdown: Time for jury evaluation and new sponsor on board</h3>
	 
	<p>The FSFE’s hacking competition for young Europeans successfully 
	concluded its six-month programming period on 30 June, with the 
	submission of the participants’ projects. Now, it's the jury's turn to 
	evaluate the work of the participants. We are also happy to announce a 
	new sponsor for the contest, OpenSSF.</p>

	<p><em>Do you also want to contribute to this contest? We are looking for 
	more sponsors! For more information get in contact with us via <a href="contact@fsfe.org">email</a>.</em></p> 

	<h3 id="ZOOOM-project">ZOOOM project: Toolkit and training materials</h3> 

	<p>The FSFE finished its work with the European Commission funded <a href="/activities/zooom/zooom.html">ZOOOM 
	Initiative</a>. The FSFE 
	produced research and educational materials on Free Software legal 
	issues, which contributed to <a href="   https://zooom4u.eu/index.php/toolkit/">a larger toolkit on Open 
	Software, Data, 
	and Hardware</a>.</p>

	<p>Although the 
	project has officially ended, the <a href="https://zooom4u.eu/">ZOOOM 
	toolkit and training materials</a> can contribute to promote a 
	healthier ecosystem 
	where Free Software legal and licensing obligations are understood and 
	followed in various digital industries.</p>

	<h3 id="quote-community">Get involved: Why do you support Free Software? Send us your quote</h3> 
	<p>We are updating our testimonials from our diverse community about why 
	they support the FSFE and our mission. We would also love to hear from 
	you! Send us, by the end of September, a short quote and a picture. <a href="/about/people/testimonials.html">Find all the testimonies 
	here</a>.</p>
