	  Code is law, as Lawrence Lessig put it. Therefore free software and
	  open standards are necessary for human freedom.
	  Our freedom is threatened by patents, copy-prevention schemes,
	  locked-down devices and spying. To counter these threats I support the
	  FSFE's campaigning for open standards, information security and device
	  sovereignty, and against ever more onerous copyright laws.
