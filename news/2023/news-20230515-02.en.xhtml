<h1>Report: The end-user perspective on Router Freedom</h1>

<p>
In a comprehensive survey, end-users from all over Europe shared their experience about ISPs’ commercial 
practices regarding terminal equipment and how Router Freedom is affected.

<a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/rf-survey-report-2023.pdf">With more than 1600 responses, this overarching survey (EN)</a> shows how Internet Service 
Providers (ISPs) still hamper consumer freedom of choice, exercise 
lock-in over internet equipment and promote proprietary devices, 
negatively affecting consumer welfare, security, privacy and data 
protection. Besides, participants showed decisive support for Router 
Freedom. The wealth of information brought by them provided deep 
insights on limitations against users trying to connect their own 
legitimate equipment to the internet. 
</p>

<h3>The telecom sector and end-users</h3>

<p>
“Is there Router Freedom in Europe?” This question was the starting point for the <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/rf-survey-report-2023.pdf">Router 
Freedom Survey</a>. The interests of end-users reflect the necessity to 
enable freedom of terminal equipment in Europe. Since 2013, the Free 
Software Foundation Europe has been working to make this right a 
reality in Europe. Router Freedom is understood in a broader context as 
<a href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index">a crucial element of Device Neutrality</a>, and it requires that network 
operators should allow end-users to run Free Software on their devices. 
The Router Freedom survey was part of an initiative for civil society 
engagement during the national implementation processes of the EU 
reform of telecommunications law. 
</p>


<p>
The lack of comprehensive research on end-user perspective regarding 
terminal equipment motivated this two-year project. By 22 March 2023, 
the survey had gathered 1652 responses from consumers from all over 
Europe. The survey shed light on how end-users feel towards Router 
Freedom, their understanding of the importance of this right in the 
context of Net Neutrality principles, privacy, fair competition and 
digital sustainability. The survey also collected information about the 
issues and problems faced by end-users when trying to use their private 
routers for internet connection. 
</p>

<h3>Router Freedom faces challenges in Europe</h3> 

<p>
This survey 
serves not only civil society and consumer organisations with primary 
data on end-user experience, but also regulators and policy makers in 
their regulatory efforts. Participants’ comments were crucial to 
understand the hurdles and challenges faced by anyone trying to use 
their own equipment for internet connection. The main findings of the 
survey include:
</p>

<ul> 

<li>
<strong>Limitations to freedom of choice</strong>. Some ISPs restrict end-users 
from connecting their routers, modems and fiber terminal equipment (ONT) to 
the public network. This is observed more intensively in countries 
where the position of the Network Termination Point (NTP) is not regulated in 
a configuration favourable to end-users.
</li> 

<li>
<strong>ISP’s lock-in</strong>. Besides limiting freedom of choice, some ISPs impose other restrictions 
that increase switching costs by end-users, charge for the provided 
equipment and impose fines when end-users use their own equipment. 
Lock-in is significantly more notable on fiber networks (FTTH)  
contracts and in countries where Router Freedom is not 
regulated.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Provision of proprietary devices</strong>. The routers, modems and optical 
fiber  devices (ONT) provided by ISPs are 
generally proprietary. End-users cannot inspect their firmware or 
install an alternative operating system. This is especially problematic 
with FTTH connections, since in the majority of 
contracts end-users cannot change the ONT imposed by ISPs.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Security issues</strong>. The lack of Router Freedom generates negative 
consequences for network security. Some ISPs do not provide security 
updates for their devices. When end-users cannot manage their own 
routers, they become more exposed to security flaws.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Unlawful commercial and technical practices</strong>. Even where Router 
Freedom has been established by legislation, ISPs can still hamper 
end-users’ ability to choose and use their own routers and modems. Some 
ISPs make it cumbersome to replace the ISP's equipment, take a long 
time to provide login data or other access credentials, fail to offer 
technical support for the network or threaten end-users who use 
personal routers with contract termination or fines. 
</li>

</ul>

	<figcaption>In this chart of types of connection and router usage can be seen that, although the majority of DSL subscribers use their own routers, those on fiber and coaxial connections are still dependent on ISPs’ equipment</figcaption>

<h3>Router Freedom as a policy demand</h3>

<p>
More than a technical issue, <a href="/activities/routers/routers.html">freedom of terminal equipment is also a policy demand</a>. All over 
Europe, end-users have manifested their support for regulatory policies 
safeguarding the right to choose and use routers and modems. More than 
90% of participants agreed Router Freedom  is key for net neutrality 
and open internet, security and data protection, fair competition and 
digital sustainability. Therefore, the outcome of this survey serves as 
key insight for policy makers regulating Router Freedom and consumer 
organisations protecting and promoting the rights of end-users.

<h3>Router Freedom and Device Neutrality</h3>

<p>Router Freedom is the 
right of consumers of any Internet Service Provider to choose and use a 
private modem and router instead of equipment provided by the Internet 
Service Provider. <a href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index">Device Neutrality protects end-users</a> against 
discriminatory restrictions on Free Software on their devices. With 
Router Freedom, end-users can install a customized operating system on 
their equipment and exercise control over the technology. Please

long-term commitment and professional dedication to defending people’s 
rights to control technology.
