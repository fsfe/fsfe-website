<h1>Freedom in Multimedia</h1>
</center>

<p>Multimedia in general and audio in particular were areas dominated
almost exclusively by proprietary software. Within the "A GNU/Linux
Audio distribution" (AGNULA) project, a group of European
universities, companies and organisations -- among them the <a
href="/index.html">Free Software Foundation Europe</a> (FSFE) -- set
out to change this in 2001.</p>

<p>Version 1.0 of AGNULA was finally released in early 2004.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul><p>This section contains some of the background and historical
information about AGNULA.</p>

<h3>Information Society Technologies</h3>

<p><img src="ist_logo.png" border="0" align="right" /> AGNULA managed
to be accepted as European Commission project IST-2001-34879 and was
funded from April 1st, 2002 until March 31st, 2004. The project was
coordinated by Nicola Bernardini from Centro Tempo Reale, Florence,
Italy.</p>

<p>The project was finished to the full satisfaction of the European
Commission and you can read the final article about AGNULA on the IST
results page of the European Commission at <a
href="http://istresults.cordis.lu/index.cfm?section=news&amp;tpl=article&amp;BrowsingType=Features&amp;ID=64618">http://istresults.cordis.lu/index.cfm?section=news&amp;tpl=article&amp;BrowsingType=Features&amp;ID=64618</a>.</p>

<h3>FSF Europe Contributions</h3>

<p>One seminal role of the FSF Europe inside the AGNULA EU project was
to take care of the legal issues, decide upon acceptable licensing
policies and care about legal maintainability. Other tasks were making
sure that Free Software community interests are heard, helping that
information is provided in the best possible way and work on the
dissemination of the final results:</p>

<ul>

<li>Deliverable 1.3.1: "Free Software Copyright and Licensing
Recommendations" <br /> Available as <a
href="/projects/agnula/deliverable-1.3.1.html">HTML</a> and <a
href="1.3.1-Licensing-Copyright.pdf">PDF (57k)</a></li><br />

<li><a href="/projects/fla/">Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA)</a><br />
The implementation of the policy described in deliverable 1.3.1</li><br />

<li><a href="/projects/agnula/java.html">Python GUI for jMax</a><br />
