      <p>FLOSS plays a key role in the preservation --- and development! --- of historical technologies. Yet, as with many other social conquests, FLOSS wasnâ€™t always there: it is an achievement resulting from collective action, practices of imagination and redesign. Before and After (Computer) Freedom guides its visitors to discover the roots of the FLOSS movement: why it was necessary, its first steps, key milestones. By interacting with restored historical computers, visitors will have the chance to explore key moments in the FLOSS movement rediscovering needs, visions and breakthroughs. A machine for time paradoxes and a love letter to FLOSS, the exhibition invites passers-by to a nostalgia trip, and the truly curious to a voyage to a world that could have been... or that still could be. </p>
     <p>The exhibition will be available on November 7th and 8th during SFSCON, the South Tyrol Free Software Conference. Find us in the &quot;Hacking Village&quot; at the Crane Hall during all the opening times of SFSCON! The exhibition is curated by Lorenzo Angeli (Uni Trento) and Mirko Marchesin (independent).</p>
