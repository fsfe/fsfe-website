  <h1>Call for Participation: FSFE Track About "Digital Education" During the Libre Software Meeting in Strasbourg, France</h1>
  
  <p>From 7 to 12 July there will be the Libre
  Software Meeting in Strasbourg, France. The conference also known as
  RMLL is annualy rotating and currently the biggest Free Software
  event in France. This year, the main topic is "Digital Education:
  building captivity or new empowerment?". With <a href="https://rmll2018.info/conferences/RMLL2018/program/proposals/new">the FSFE track</a> we are
  looking for inspiring insights about golden cages and liberation not
  only in educational institutions but in our everyday lives.</p>

  <p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is happy to align with
  Hackstub, the Strasbourg hackerspace that is organising the <a href="https://2018.rmll.info/">Libre
  Software Meeting 2018</a>, and to generate an own FSFE track. With the
  main topic being "Digital Education: building captivity or new
  empowerment?" we would like to concentrate on the golden cages that
  surround us and that rope more and more people in every day. For us
  at the FSFE, digital education is not just about college education.
  It is also about the digital literacy we need to spread within the
  digital society.</p>

  <p>We have seen a lot of new forms of social exchange and
  collaboration coming up in the past decade and are in a stage where
  there is hardly any day passing at our work place, in our social
  network or our daily environment that does not require the
  interaction with software in any form. A lot of this software is
  proprietary or interacts with other proprietary software. Every day,
  new people teach themselves or are told how to use these proprietary
  services - be it by order of their employer, by peer-pressure in
  their networks or even enforcement by administrations. In some way or
  the other, every day new people get their own "digital
  education".</p>

  <p>In the FSFE's track we look for ways that do not rope us in but
  empower us instead. Free Software solutions that give us the liberty
  to keep sovereignty of our data, to collaborate on new technologies
  and to help everyone to understand the technology behind. You know
  about a good piece of software that other people can learn from or
  use in their daily interactions? You have insights on administrative
  or educative processes? You can explain contexts that lead to
  dependencies or empowerment?</p>

  <p>Then <a href="https://rmll2018.info/conferences/RMLL2018/program/proposals/new">apply for the FSFE track</a> in one of the four categories:
  "Initiation", "Tech", "Society" or "Culture &amp; Art". We are
  looking for talks and workshops. You can find more detailed
  information about the different topics on the <a
  href="https://2018.rmll.info/">LSM2018 pages</a>. The deadline to
  apply is 30 April.</p>
