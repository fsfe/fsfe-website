<h1>Input for the BEREC's guidelines on Router Freedom in Europe</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">
  Router Freedom is the right of customers of any Internet Service
  Provider (ISP) to choose and use a private modem and router instead
  of a router that the ISP forces them to use. The Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) drafted guidelines for national agencies how to deal with
  Router Freedom in their countries. The Free Software Foundation
  Europe (FSFE) provided mixed feedback to an ongoing public
  consulation.
</p>

<p>
  The status of <a href="/activities/routers">Router Freedom</a> in
  Europe differs from country to country as the <a
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters/#Router_Freedom_in_Europe">monitoring
  by the FSFE</a> shows. The core of the debate is the question of
  where the Network Termination Point (NTP) is located. This defines where
  the network of the ISP ends and where the network of the user begins. If
  the modem and router are considered part of the ISP's infrastructure, a user cannot claim
  sovereignty of their communication and security.
</p>

<p>
  The patchwork rug of different rules may change soon as BEREC, the
  Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications, has been
  commissioned to create guidelines for the National Regulatory
  Agencies (NRAs) and help them with implementing European regulation
  in a harmonised way. <a
  href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/routers/8821-draft-berec-guidelines-on-common-approac_0.pdf">BEREC's
  current draft of the guidelines</a> is up for public consultation
  until 21 November 2019. We analysed this draft and the EU
  Directives and Regulations it references, and provided our conclusion in a <a
  href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/routers/20191121-BEREC-Guidelines-Consultation.pdf">brief
  document</a>.
</p>
In short, BEREC puts three different models forward to discussion:

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<ol>
  <li>
    The network termination point is at location A. This means that
    routers and modems are under the user's control, who can decide which
    device to use â€“ either the one recommended and provided by the ISP
    or one by a third party. That would result in Router Freedom.
  </li>
  <li>
    The NTP is at B. This means that only the modem (so the device
    connecting to the ISP) will be part of the ISP's network, but
    routers or media boxes will be in the user's domain.
  </li>
  <li>
    The NTP is at C. That's the most restrictive option as it results
    in the modem and router or a combined device being solely under the
    control of the ISP.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Understandably, we argued in favour of making point A the network
  termination point to establish and protect freedom of choice, privacy
  and data protection, fair competition of device manufacturers, as well as
  security. Furthermore, we made a few suggestions to improve the
  guidelines and their implementation by the National Regulatory
  Agencies:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    In this draft, the guidelines carefully weigh up the different
    possible locations for the NTP. However, it is clear from the
    arguments that only point A makes sense from a perspective of
    customers and businesses, and that no serious technological reasons
    speak against it. BEREC should take a more firm stand on this and
    discourage National Agencies from making any other choice to reduce
    a patchwork rug of different regulations.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is a whole section discussing the impact of the different NTP
    locations on ISPs and network operators, but users' necessities are
    only implied, although a EU Directive from 2008
    and a EU Regulation from 2015 clearly state that customers have to
    have Router Freedom. We ask BEREC to elaborate the
    different options also more prominently from the perspective of
    technology users.
  </li>
</ul>
