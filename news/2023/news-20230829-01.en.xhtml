<h1>Halftime for the German government: Thank you for the fine words, now let the deeds speak!</h1>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), together with an 
alliance of civil society and the Free Software industry, calls on the 
German government to implement a sustainable digital policy and to 
provide the necessary funds in the federal budget now.</p>

<p>FSFE draws a negative mid-term balance for the digital policy of the 
German government. Together with 20 actors from civil society and the 
Free Software industry, the FSFE demands: The Federal Government and 
the coalition parties in the Bundestag must now urgently implement 
their digital policy promises from the coalition agreement. They must 
provide sufficient funding for this in the 2024 budget. Civil society 
must also be more closely involved in the decision-making process. It 
is high time to put Germany on a sustainable, inclusive digital policy 
course. The government must not squander its last chance to do so in 
this parliamentary term.</p>

<p>Two years ago, the German government launched a good and widely 
praised digital policy programme, promising a change of course and a 
more successful, sustainable and inclusive digitisation. Unfortunately, 
halfway through the legislative period, this change of course is still 
a long way off. So far, the government has launched only a few projects 
and is planning to make painful cuts in next year's budget. This 
threatens to lead to a failure of digital policy at the end of the 
legislative period, and to long-term damage to society and the 
economy.</p> 

<h3>FSFE calls for Free Software in German administrations</h3>

<p>Halfway through its term in office, the German government has failed 
to live up to its promise in the coalition agreement to prioritise Free 
Software (also known as Open Source) and open standards in the 
digitisation of the administration. Isolated steps in the right 
direction, such as the establishment of the Centre for Digital 
Sovereignty (ZenDiS), are to be thwarted in the 2024 budget. Public 
procurement law has not been modernised to facilitate the tendering and 
procurement of Free Software. There are still no public statistics on 
the procurement of Free Software by administrations.</p>

<p>Instead, the federal government continues to rely largely on 
proprietary software. More than three billion euros of budget funds are 
earmarked for the proprietary “Oracle cloud”, while the already too 
small funds for digital sovereignty of currently 48 million euros are 
to be cut by almost half in the new budget. At the same time, the 
government seems to regard Free Software as expendable in ensuring 
digital sovereignty. The proprietary Federal Client (Bundesclient) 
developed on the government’s behalf by the ITZ Bund is in blatant 
contradiction to the government's declared goal of strengthening Free 
Software and thus true digital sovereignty.</p>


<p><blockquote> Johannes Näder, FSFE’s Senior Policy Project Manager, explains: <italic>"The 
German government must stand by its promises in the coalition agreement 
and decide that Free Software will be procured and developed as a 
priority for the administration in the future. The principle 'Public 
Money? Public Code!' must become the guiding principle of German 
digital policy: Publicly financed software developed for the public 
sector must be Free Software. This is the only way the government can 
achieve a sustainable, innovative digitisation of Germany that benefits 
everyone and empowers citizens to control technology."</italic>.</blockquote></p>

<p>Under the slogan "Public Money? Public Code!", the Free Software 
Foundation Europe has long been calling for the sustainable 
digitisation of the German administration through the use of Free 
Software. The fact that the corresponding plans from the coalition 
agreement have not yet been implemented has recently also been 
criticised within the government parties.</p> 

<p><blockquote><italic>"Within the next two years, important steps need to be taken to 
digitise the German administration. The German Government has only two 
years left to fulfil the promises made in the coalition agreement. 
Digital sovereignty can only be guaranteed through Free Software. The 
government must therefore modernise public procurement law in line with 
‘Public Money? Public Code!’ and finally publish statistics on the 
share of Free Software in development and procurement in the 
administration. Last but not least, a fully-fledged Free Software 
working environment should be made available to public authorities in a 
timely manner. For this to succeed, the budget for digital sovereignty 
must be increased and consistently used for Free Software," </italic> demands 
Johannes Näder.</blockquote></p>

<h3>Free Software and "Public Money"?</h3> 
<p>Free Software gives everyone the right to use, study, share, and improve applications for 
any purpose. These freedoms ensure that similar applications do not 
have to be programmed from scratch every time and, thanks to 
transparent processes, others do not have to reinvent the wheel. In 
large projects, expertise and costs can be shared and applications paid 
for by the general public are available to all. This promotes 
innovation and saves taxpayers money in the medium to long term. 
Dependencies on vendors are minimised and security issues can be fixed 
more easily. The Free Software Foundation Europe, together with over 
200 organisations and administrations, is therefore calling for “Public 
Money? Public Code!” - If it is public money, it should be public code 
as well. More information on the initiative is available on the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">“Public Money? 
Public Code!” website</a>.</p>
