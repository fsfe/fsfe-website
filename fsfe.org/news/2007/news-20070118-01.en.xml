    <title>FSFE becomes the legal guardian of the OpenSwarm Project</title>
    <body>
      <p>
The OpenSwarm Project will be protected by FSFE's Freedom Task Force 
(FTF).  Shane Coughlan, FTF Coordinator, explains "The Freedom Task 
Force is here to help strengthen the legal foundation of the Free 
Software eco-system.  The Fiduciary licence Agreement is part of this.  
It provides a clear way for projects to consolidate their copyright.  
In the case of OpenSwarm, FSFE is acting a legal guardian for the 
project and ensuring that the developers can focus on maturing an 
exciting development platform."
