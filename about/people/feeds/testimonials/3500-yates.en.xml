      Every time I use non-free software I end up regretting it, because
      non-free software's ultimate job is to make money for someone else, not
      to serve the user. I simplified my personal and professional life by
      using only free software, but that's not enough: no person is an island,
      and other people's software choices impact me. Supporting the FSFE allows
      me to combine my voice with many others to let people, corporations, and
      governments know that free software has an important place in everyday
      life.
