<h2 id="from-the-fsfe">From the FSFE</h2>

<h2 id="meps-in support-of-our-amendments" >MEPs in support of our amendments</h2>

<p>The European Parliamentary committees for Internal Market and Consumer 
Protection (IMCO) as well as Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) issued 
their joint own-initiative report based on the Commission's Digital Single 
Market Strategy. FSFE's policy team analysed their report and proposed 
changes to include standards that are open, minimalistic, and implementable 
with Free Software, to integrate users' control over their data and to 
make sure that the single open science cloud is implemented with 
Free Software.</p>

<p>The report received more than 1000 amendments from Members of the European 
Parliament (MEPs), several of whom supported our points and proposed amendments. 
This shows increased awareness in the Parliament towards the importance 
of Free Software in &quot;cloud computing&quot;, big data and standardisation, 
as well as in public sector. Shadow rapporteur Cornelia Ernst even highlighted 
the need to address Free Software during her talk in the joint meeting of 
IMCO/ITRE on 10 November. This month, on December 14, the Parliament will 
vote for the final version of the report.</p>

<p>Although the report is non-binding and the Commission is not obliged 
to follow the Parliament's recommendations, the fact that our amendments 
were supported by several MEPs is an important step. Especially in the 
Parliament that is usually less receptive when it comes to the issues 
concerning digital rights and Free Software.</p>

<h2 id="germany-passed-law-against-compulsory-routers">Germany passed law 
against compulsory routers</h2>

<p><a href="/activities/routers/timeline.html">After three 
years of intensive lobbying by the FSFE</a> and other organisations, the 
German Parliament as well as the second chamber, the Federal Council, 
passed a law against compulsory routers but for free choice of the user. 
This is an important step towards consumer protection and fair competition 
of manufacturers. Free choice also empowers users to take care of critical 
features like security or privacy on their own preferred device. The law 
will become effective in the mid of 2016 and should set an example across 
Europe. We will support similar legislation wherever needed.</p>

<h2 id="sony-rootkit-makes-headlines-10-years-later">Sony Rootkit makes 
headlines 10 years later</h2>

<p>In the end of October FSFE reminded of the dangers posed by technical 
restrictions on technology to promote everyone's right to tinker. As a 
result, the topic got picked up by the press and the FSFE info page was 
linked with at least a dozen articles from several big name news sources. 
Our ex-intern Asa Ritz <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/asawritz/2015/11/04/sony-rootkit-still-making-headlines-10-years-later-2/">summarised</a> in his blogpost the media coverage we received.</p>

<h2 id="good-free-software-news">Good Free Software News</h2>

<p>At the <strong>EU</strong> level: the European Parliament calls upon 
the Commission for the <a href="/news/2015/news-20151110-01.html">systematic 
replacement of proprietary software by verifiable Free Software in all 
the EU institutions</a>. In <strong>Italy</strong>, the <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500256578/Free-software-gains-ground-in-the-Italian-public-administration">Italian Ministry of Defence is replacing Microsoft Office with 
LibreOffice</a> on 150,000 PCs in what is Europe’s second largest 
LibreOffice implementation. Meanwhile, the second most important industrial 
city in Southern Italy, <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/146281">Bari, 
is about to complete its transition to LibreOffice</a> and the ODF. At 
the same time in <strong>Switzerland</strong>, the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/bern-council-demands-transition-open-source">council 
of Bern ordered the IT department to end its dependence on proprietary 
software</a>, and replace proprietary software by Free Software solutions.
The same example was followed in <strong>Denmark</strong> where the city of Aarhus <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/denmark%E2%80%99s-aarhus-insists-open-it-standards">is requiring the use of open IT standards for all of its future IT projects</a> 
in order to rid itself of IT vendor lock-in. Lastly, recent study in 
<strong>France</strong> confirmed that <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/147785">country's administration is still a large enabler of Free Software in France</a>. 
According to the study, the Free Software market is growing on a linear trend and will grow by 9% annually until 2020.</p>
