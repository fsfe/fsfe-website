      <p>An other of our Viennese traditional information stalls on the Veganmania summer festival at Donauinsel. Every year tausands of people visit this festival with a lot of tasty vegan street food and shopping opportunities and a very clear focus on sustainability and fun. Since over a decade we added free software information to the mix. And in our experience the people on this event are much more open to the concept of free software than the people we encounter on ordinary information stall on the streets in Vienna.</p>
