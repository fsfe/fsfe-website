      "This book is the story of a collective liberation initiated by a curious and inspiring little girl. It’s the story of a digital world that empowers rather than alienating. But this book also has a beautiful story. The authors of the original version have placed it under a free license. In this case, copyright is no longer “all rights reserved”, but allows the work to be used, modified and shared. This choice encourages the circulation of the work, which is how I discovered the existence of Ada &amp; Zangemann. This choice also favors translations of the work, which gave me the idea of a collaborative educational project for its French translation.
			More than a hundred students, aged 13 to 19, translated the book from German into French, sharing the work and coordinating digitally. Well done to them! And thanks to their teachers and to ADEAF (Association for the development of German language teaching in France) for making this possible.
			At the Ministry, we support the development of digital commons as part of our digital education and digital literacy missions. The theme of this book and its young translators are a remarkable example."
