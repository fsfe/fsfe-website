    <h2>Sponsoring Buttons</h2>

    <p>
      In order to give the FSFE <a href="/help/thankgnus.html">donors</a> the
      possibility to publicly announce their contribution, the FSFE provides
      <a href="sponsoring/sponsoring.html">sponsoring buttons</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Logo</h2>

    <p style="text-align:center">
      <img src="logo.png" border="0" alt="logo"/>
      <br />
      vector format: [<a href="logo.svg">svg</a>]
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center">
      <img src="stars.png" border="0" alt="stars"/>
      <br />
      vector format: [<a href="stars.svg">svg</a>]
    </p>

    <h3>Terms of usage</h3>

    <p>
      The Logo of the FSFE must never be used in a way that could be understood
      as endorsing certain activities, home pages, products or entities without
      prior consent of the FSFE.  Please contact
      &lt;<a href="mailto:team@lists.fsfe.org?subject=Logo">team@lists.fsfe.org</a>&gt;
      if you wish to know whether your intended usage is suitable and whether
      you can use it in a certain context.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, if you're organising an event where one of the speakers
      is representing the FSFE, you may not use the FSFE Logo in a way that
      makes it seem as if the FSFE is endorsing the event. You may, however,
      show the FSFE Logo in connection with the speaker, to clearly show
      the affiliation of the speaker.
    </p>
