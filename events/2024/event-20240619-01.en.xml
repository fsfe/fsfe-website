      <p>FSFE's project “They are young + they need the code” is inspired from the work Ada&amp;Zangemann by Matthias Kirschner, president of the Free Software Foundation Europe, who wrote this book to explain to his children the value of Free Software. Also involved in the project is Sandra Brandstaetter, a famous artist and illustrator of children's fairy tales who enriched the book with her valuable illustrations. <br />
FSFE designed the educational format “They are young + they need the code” that, through reading the book and manual activities, can make children understand the importance of freedom and control of technology. <br />
This format will be presented online at 6pm on June 19th 2024</p>
