	  As a web designer I spend most of my time working on computers.
	  Therefore, usability is very relevant to me. Software vendors often
	  ignore open standards. They deliberately build solutions that only
	  work using their own products. I oppose this greed and take a stand
	  for cooperation. Free software relies on open standards. This way it
	  enables me to provide a diverse audience with clear and reliable
	  experiences - no matter which software they run. I create media in
	  formats that can be used freely by everyone. By employing free
	  software I support independence and help making the world a better
	  place.
