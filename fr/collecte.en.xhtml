      <blockquote>
	<b>Contribution to collect articles about Free Software.</b>
<p>What we are looking for are articles that say something new; go into
great depth about an aspect; consider the wider social or legal meanings;
give a good overview of the subject; talk about the history in depth;
or other well-written pieces.
Something that is just so-so or just says the same-old-thing would not
really contribute to our collection.</p>

<menu>
<b>1. Collect articles</b>
   <p>
   <li>Cut the pages of the newspaper, magazine related to Free Software</li>
   <li>Cut the cover</li>
   <li>Cut the part of the magazine that lists the address, name of the
      publication, contacts for editorial enquiries (ours in french)</li>
   </p>
   <p>(Replace with copies if you cannot cut)</p>

<b>2. Describe each article</b>

   <p>Write a four lines summary including :</p>

      <p>

      <li>A short description of the content of the article in english</li>
      <li>A rating of the quality of the article (1 - 5)</li>
      <li>A rating of the general quality of the newspaper, magazine</li>
      </p>

<b>3. Wrap and send</b>
