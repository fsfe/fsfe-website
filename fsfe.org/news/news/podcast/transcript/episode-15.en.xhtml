00:00.000 --> 00:18.280
Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:18.280 --> 00:21.680
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation, Europe.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.560
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:25.560 --> 00:31.320
I'm Bonnie Merring and our guest for today's podcast is Eric Alvers.

00:31.320 --> 00:37.160
Eric works for the FSFE as a program manager for digital sustainability and he's a happy

00:37.160 --> 00:43.960
employee as he wrote in his self bio on the FSFE's website since 2012.

00:43.960 --> 00:49.640
Eric is largely involved in the FSFE's activity regarding software sustainability and thereby

00:49.640 --> 00:53.280
alter the FSFE's upcycling Android campaign.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.280
Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast, Eric.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.280
It's nice to have you here.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.280
Thank you.

00:58.280 --> 01:08.160
Thank you for having me here and inviting me and yeah, I was waiting for this for a while and

01:08.160 --> 01:12.880
now I'm happy that we finally managed to do this podcast.

01:12.880 --> 01:13.880
Me too.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.560
Why did you write that you are a happy employee?

01:15.560 --> 01:18.000
I was so distracted by this.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.080
I don't know how to say this in a better phrase but I was like, oh, he's a happy employee.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.880
Okay, I've built down already put this into the intro.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.480
Yeah, actually it's quite funny.

01:27.480 --> 01:33.240
I don't know because I mean at the FSFE, we have the freedom to self-describing ourselves

01:33.240 --> 01:40.480
on our page and I was just writing, I'm a happy employee because that's what is the

01:40.480 --> 01:42.120
reality.

01:42.120 --> 01:50.040
But just recently someone else picked this up at a conference where I was, where the

01:50.040 --> 01:56.000
host was talking about me and presenting me and they were also picking this up saying,

01:56.000 --> 02:02.120
oh, Eric, I was just a happy employee of the FSFE and now you picked this as well.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.600
Oh, sorry, I didn't know that.

02:04.600 --> 02:08.720
No, actually it seems to me, I mean it's cool, it's like, yeah, as you say, it's definitely

02:08.720 --> 02:09.720
catchy.

02:09.720 --> 02:13.080
It catches your attention, yeah, it catches your attention.

02:13.080 --> 02:18.200
And I'm wondering why is this maybe because I mean, normally I expect people to be happy

02:18.200 --> 02:19.200
in their work.

02:19.200 --> 02:25.440
I think that should be normal, but it seems to be to surprise some people and so on.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.920
I totally understand why you're happy.

02:27.920 --> 02:34.400
It's just that seeing it and seeing it written on a bio page, you know, I was like, why

02:34.400 --> 02:41.120
did he put in there that he's a happy employee, why is he not just an employee, but I love

02:41.120 --> 02:42.120
it.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.280
I think it's the best self-description I ever read.

02:45.280 --> 02:48.480
Cool, thank you very much for this.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.240
Anyways, so let's make a happy podcast now.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.480
Let's make a happy podcast.

02:54.480 --> 02:59.760
So you have been involved with FSFE for quite a long time and I was wondering what are

02:59.760 --> 03:05.920
your first thoughts or the first thing you think about when you hear the term free software

03:05.920 --> 03:12.120
because I'm sure you have such a relationship with FSFE because of your long time working

03:12.120 --> 03:14.240
with FSFE and for the FSFE.

03:14.960 --> 03:23.520
Yeah, of course, I mean, since I spend like the last decade of my life basically on free software,

03:26.640 --> 03:29.440
actually when I think about free software, I always think about the four freedoms.

03:30.240 --> 03:37.200
I think it's just the genius written down in four core rules giving users the freedom

03:38.080 --> 03:39.920
to work with software and to...

03:40.720 --> 03:44.320
So it's more the concept of free software and it's not so much the

03:45.520 --> 03:51.120
an actual software that is released and there are free and open-source software license or like

03:52.080 --> 03:54.880
you know what I mean, like I like the approach.

03:54.880 --> 04:00.240
Yeah, maybe I don't know, I think it's a little bit based on my studies because I was studying

04:00.240 --> 04:06.240
political science and during my studies, I mean of course you have a lot of aspects regarding

04:06.320 --> 04:16.080
you know laws, philosophy and rules about how to create societies that work just fine.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.280
And so that's why I think it's such a genius and then you have...

04:20.160 --> 04:24.080
And I mean these are really common, also really complex topics and you have books,

04:24.800 --> 04:28.080
really large books about these topics of state philosophy.

04:28.720 --> 04:35.920
And in software you have the genius, you have these four sentences that basically defines

04:36.560 --> 04:44.000
users freedom since over 30 years now and this is just, yeah, amazing, having this written down

04:44.000 --> 04:51.520
in such a dense rule framework. Yeah, okay, thank you very much for the insight.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.280
How did you get on both 50 FSFE?

04:56.240 --> 05:03.440
Yo, that's a good question and it's actually already a long time ago, so I don't think I can

05:03.440 --> 05:09.440
recall all the details now, but it started during my, when I was writing my thesis, I was studying

05:09.440 --> 05:16.960
political science and I was writing a thesis about software patents. And when I was researching

05:16.960 --> 05:22.720
for the thesis, I found the... I mean, I was already aware of course of free software before and

05:22.720 --> 05:27.760
about the free software foundation. When I researched for my thesis, then I found out, oh, there's

05:27.760 --> 05:33.680
also a free software foundation Europe. And that free software foundation Europe is actually

05:33.680 --> 05:40.160
having an office in Berlin and you can do an internship there. So, yeah, one, two, three,

05:40.160 --> 05:44.880
and I thought, okay, cool, I'm anyway now finishing my study, so let's do an internship

05:44.880 --> 05:50.800
at the free software foundation Europe. Yeah, I mean, we were having this talk about happy

05:50.800 --> 05:59.600
employee and I remember I was a happy intern and I think the others have thought that as well and

05:59.600 --> 06:07.520
so I was there at the right time and I was lucky, so I became afterwards a happy employee.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.280
Okay, I'm very happy. That's your happy intern and happy employee.

06:13.680 --> 06:22.400
When did sustainability, like you have been working with the FSFE for quite a long time now since

06:22.400 --> 06:30.320
2012, so it's 10 years now and when did sustainability become such an important topic for you and

06:30.320 --> 06:37.520
your work with the FSFE? I mean, I think there's two questions in here. So, for myself,

06:38.160 --> 06:43.440
I'm like, when did the topics sustainability become important? What's already during my studies?

06:43.440 --> 06:50.640
Well, I thought it's also very important, you know, to save our environment and to save the climate

06:50.640 --> 06:58.080
and so I was really interested in how this could be possible, what can policies do, what has been done

06:59.280 --> 07:06.400
and so on. So, that's actually for myself a topic since the long time and then, yeah, of course,

07:06.400 --> 07:11.280
I'm also interested in free software since a long time, but yeah, at some point, I mean, I

07:11.280 --> 07:18.640
found that the way to merge these two topics, because they're actually very related to each other,

07:18.640 --> 07:25.120
I mean, like at one point, the German H&amp;C for environment, they were looking for input on

07:26.320 --> 07:32.640
software sustainability that was like in 2015 or so and that was, I think that was maybe the first

07:32.640 --> 07:38.320
time I was really thinking about, okay, what is sustainable software, what is software sustainability?

07:39.440 --> 07:48.000
And since then, basically, I cooperate with that H&amp;C here and there and so I take deeper and deeper

07:48.000 --> 07:53.440
and found more and more relation between free software and software sustainability.

07:53.920 --> 08:03.520
And so now, these both important topics became basically one topic for me.

08:03.520 --> 08:09.200
So, it started with yourself and your personal life and your interest in sustainability and

08:09.200 --> 08:16.080
then you brought us into the FSFE and made it also an important topic for software sustainability.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.440
Exactly.

08:18.400 --> 08:23.120
I noticed that it might be good to explain a bit more about what you understand

08:23.120 --> 08:30.080
under sustainability, because I get the feeling that you also have sustainability on a hardware

08:30.080 --> 08:35.680
approach, like most people might think about just like, okay, reuse your devices, put free software

08:35.680 --> 08:42.400
on your mobile phones and stuff like that, you know, to be able to use them longer in a safe way,

08:42.480 --> 08:48.240
but also to also explain a bit more what software sustainability actually means,

08:48.240 --> 08:53.600
because it also means that you can use it for a longer time and also that it's very important

08:53.600 --> 09:02.320
to have efficient software, right? So that software is not taking up too much energy or power while

09:02.320 --> 09:10.480
computing. Yeah, exactly. I mean, you already covered several aspects of software sustainability.

09:10.480 --> 09:16.880
I mean, the first one, I think that's one that is the easiest to follow and to understand,

09:16.880 --> 09:26.480
and the most obvious one, the relation between the software and the hardware lifetime and hardware

09:26.480 --> 09:32.080
reusability. And I think this is also a topic we cover most today and we will dig deeper later

09:32.080 --> 09:36.080
when we talk about the absiting Android campaign, because this is very in the heart of there,

09:36.640 --> 09:44.720
of this campaign. But yes, so there's a relation between the reusability of software and the

09:44.720 --> 09:50.480
reusability of hardware. So this is one of the sustainability dimensions that is what I call

09:50.480 --> 09:56.960
an external dimension, because here the software has basically an effect on the hardware.

09:57.760 --> 10:04.000
And the hardware is made of natural resources. So the way I can use a reuse software has an

10:04.000 --> 10:10.720
effect on how I can use and reuse my natural resources. And then there's the internal I mentioned

10:10.720 --> 10:17.360
that you also already introduced quite good. So the question of how long can I use a software?

10:17.360 --> 10:24.640
The question how long is it possible for future generations to reuse a software? And this is

10:25.520 --> 10:31.040
also very important, because if you think about setting up infrastructure, for example, I think

10:31.040 --> 10:37.680
this is now this for example, this decade now will be a decade where we set up a lot of public

10:38.400 --> 10:47.280
software driven infrastructure that most people call something like smart city, smart agriculture,

10:48.160 --> 10:56.240
everything that is related to normally too smart is driven of course by software and we build up

10:56.320 --> 11:01.920
large architectures. So here's the question of course there's also a question of control,

11:01.920 --> 11:10.000
but it's also a question of sustainability. So is it will it be possible to adapt this infrastructure

11:10.000 --> 11:17.120
to the needs that I have on local level? Can I reuse this in the future or can I reuse this on

11:17.120 --> 11:25.360
another in another city, all these kind of things? This makes the internal sustainability of software

11:25.840 --> 11:33.920
the reusability of it in short. And the efficiency like the last sector you were mentioning,

11:33.920 --> 11:42.720
I mean this is something that is still very in the very beginning of us understanding the efficiency

11:42.720 --> 11:50.800
of software. I think it's too early to make clear conclusions now about what software is more

11:50.800 --> 11:56.000
efficient than what is less efficient, although there has been just recently given out it's also

11:56.000 --> 12:01.920
interesting and there has been given out the first blue angel for software efficiency and it has

12:01.920 --> 12:11.200
been given to a to a free software program, Ocular, the KDE Ocular universal document reader.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.760
But it's very interesting that it finishes though it's very interesting that definitely for the other

12:20.720 --> 12:26.560
sectors we were just talking about like the internal dimension of how long a software is available

12:26.560 --> 12:32.480
and how is it usable and the aspect of how long is the hardware available and usable.

12:33.520 --> 12:42.720
For both free software is key for sustainability that is the point we currently at the free software

12:42.720 --> 12:47.040
foundation Europe want to help people to understand this.

12:50.320 --> 12:56.640
Why did you choose mobile phones? Like I'm quite sure there's a lot more out there but yeah

12:57.440 --> 13:03.520
why? I mean there are some arguments that really yeah that are really in favor of choosing mobile

13:03.520 --> 13:10.320
phones for the topic because the first point is I don't know I have no curiosity but it's like 80%

13:10.320 --> 13:15.520
of humankind or something has a has a mobile phone so this is something people they use it in a

13:15.520 --> 13:23.280
daily life so everyone knows what we talk about. Second many people are annoyed like you buy a mobile

13:23.280 --> 13:30.000
phone today and two years later you have to buy a new one because the software doesn't run anymore

13:30.000 --> 13:37.840
like the way you want it to run or you cannot get this new train the application on your phone

13:38.560 --> 13:43.360
you don't get support anymore so like when when I talk to people and I explain them software of

13:43.360 --> 13:51.440
solace sense with their mobile phone basically for now everyone understands it so that makes it

13:51.440 --> 13:58.400
very easy you know to also talk people who who do normally not care so much about the deeper topics

13:58.400 --> 14:07.200
of a software but also I mean most humans on the planet have a mobile phone the numbers are really

14:08.160 --> 14:15.680
crazy I mean this this case so high like we produce 1.5 billion smartphones every year

14:18.000 --> 14:24.560
and 1.5 billion smartphones and all of them including all the resources and the energy that you

14:24.560 --> 14:34.160
need to produce them like we need 80% of all energy for mobile phones we use in the production of

14:34.160 --> 14:42.640
the mobile phone and only 20% in through all the time that we use it so if we can and that's

14:42.640 --> 14:50.640
now my point so if we can somehow try to bring down the production numbers of mobile phones by using

14:50.640 --> 14:57.440
it a little bit longer like using it just one year longer it has a really because it gets

14:57.440 --> 15:03.360
why there's a really big effect on the environment and on the resources that have been used to produce

15:03.360 --> 15:10.960
new mobile phones exactly this brings me to the question how could people use their mobile phones

15:10.960 --> 15:16.880
longer I think this is kind of the core of the campaign like of the upcycling Android campaign

15:18.000 --> 15:26.320
so how and yeah how can people do that it's actually quite easy you can install a free software

15:26.320 --> 15:33.680
operating system and you can keep using it so that's the sort of answer okay and the long answer

15:35.280 --> 15:42.720
so let's start with the free software operation system that people can install I think

15:43.600 --> 15:49.760
we used to call them customer arms but in our talk before we did the podcast you also

15:49.760 --> 15:55.280
mentioned that we shouldn't use the term customer arms anymore can you dive into this a bit

15:57.280 --> 16:04.480
yeah you can still say customer arms but the the customer some I mean many people think okay there's

16:05.760 --> 16:10.640
there are customer arms and that's it but there's more than just customer arms that was the

16:10.640 --> 16:18.880
mortar point like okay what is the customer arm a customer Android itself is developed by Google and

16:18.880 --> 16:26.400
the main components of Android they are published under a free software license so what is not

16:26.400 --> 16:34.960
published as free software is all the Google stuff all the G apps and some call libraries and so

16:34.960 --> 16:42.480
not everything is free software but a large part of the Android operating system is published

16:42.480 --> 16:50.800
under a free software license under the MIT license so there are communities out there who

16:51.520 --> 16:58.880
take that code reuse that code and publish a customized version of Android so that's why it's

16:58.880 --> 17:04.880
called custom ROM these are the custom ROM there's a lot of out there one of the more popular ones

17:04.880 --> 17:13.120
is lineage or s lineage or s is popular because it just runs on so many different phones and it's

17:14.000 --> 17:21.840
out there since a while now more modern versions are graphino s cardics or s e

17:24.080 --> 17:31.840
yeah they're quite a lot of customer arms exactly many more I cannot I cannot list all of them here so

17:32.480 --> 17:39.680
and the good thing about custom ROMs let's say the good thing for the user is if you install a custom

17:39.680 --> 17:47.840
ROM it's very close to your Android system so you are already used to the system that's not a lot

17:47.840 --> 17:55.840
of burden for you to learn something new but there's also the there's also a lot of communities more

17:55.840 --> 18:01.360
and more who want to offer a full GNU Linux operating system on mobile phones

18:02.960 --> 18:10.560
because the Android itself is also based on Linux kernel so the mobile phones are easy to run

18:10.560 --> 18:18.000
the Linux kernel and so it's also basically easy to run a GNU Linux system but of course you have

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
to change the whole interface is because of course you have a touch screen you have a very tiny

18:24.080 --> 18:31.440
screen so and maybe you don't want to do the things you do with a normal like with your laptop when

18:31.440 --> 18:39.280
you run a GNU Linux system you maybe want to I don't know they are of course customized for mobile

18:39.280 --> 18:51.040
use and phones and although they are still in in the beginning so you can use them you can normally

18:51.680 --> 18:54.800
do most of the stuff that you want to do with a phone you can do with them

18:56.240 --> 19:02.960
you can not necessarily do everything there's sometimes issues with drivers so you don't get to work

19:02.960 --> 19:09.120
some component of your phone but I think this is a question of time and I'm really looking forward to

19:11.360 --> 19:18.400
let's say I don't know time saying time is always difficult but let's see how the development goes

19:18.400 --> 19:28.320
to three years something to having new Linux systems that I can run on my mobile phone on my

19:28.320 --> 19:37.920
computer as well and then I can really nicely interconnect these devices and shrink them and you

19:37.920 --> 19:47.840
know I mean that would be my favorite choice once it's developed and I see that coming so that

19:47.840 --> 19:56.640
gives me actually a lot of hope here um so you have started the upcycling Android campaign to

19:57.840 --> 20:04.720
rise awareness about this important topic of sustainability and reusing your mobile phones

20:04.720 --> 20:13.040
under a free software yes yes um could you give us an overview of what has happened during the

20:13.040 --> 20:17.520
last months and what was your biggest success with the campaign?

20:19.760 --> 20:27.920
I mean the publication itself was a quite a success so it has been picked up by media not only

20:27.920 --> 20:38.080
not only technical media but also larger news science and local newspapers and I don't know we

20:38.080 --> 20:45.840
had a really big success in in bringing out the first message about the campaign and of course

20:45.840 --> 20:53.120
then based on that of course a lot of reactions people writing us saying that's cool or can we

20:53.120 --> 21:05.520
give a talk here or there so that was that was basically a huge success and the generally the

21:05.520 --> 21:13.040
campaign is very well received we we have a lot of people interested in the topic itself

21:14.480 --> 21:22.720
and in the workshops we are doing so that can be seen as a challenge and says and I think one of

21:22.720 --> 21:34.960
the key stones that we now achieved was publishing an open letter so together with um initially 38

21:34.960 --> 21:41.840
organizations meanwhile there's around 50 organizations who co-signed this open letter

21:41.840 --> 21:52.880
we published an open letter in that we demand for key aspects for more digital sustainability

21:52.880 --> 21:58.240
that lead to more digital sustainability and we demand this in the up for the upcoming

21:59.200 --> 22:09.520
discussions surrounding the European equal design criteria so the European equal design

22:09.520 --> 22:20.480
area is a framework that says how products have to be made in order to be sustainable and to be

22:21.200 --> 22:29.520
recyclable to be reusable and these things so you have to follow these criteria in order to

22:29.520 --> 22:37.120
sell your product in the European Union because it's basically the baseline of how your product has to be

22:37.120 --> 22:46.000
sustainable and the current regulations they say no word about software not a single one and so

22:46.880 --> 22:53.840
they are and they are from 2008 or nine or so and now the European Union in the next two years

22:53.840 --> 23:00.720
is going to redefine them with several legislative initiatives and this is exactly the point where we

23:00.720 --> 23:11.440
want uh where we want to drop in and um of course explain how software relates to the longevity of

23:11.440 --> 23:22.560
hardware but also like um give give help on what exactly can be changed based on that finding to

23:22.560 --> 23:33.760
have more long lasting electronic products and uh yeah this is again made not only a lot of

23:33.760 --> 23:44.640
publicity but also i mean it's the first time for us that there are organizations really large

23:44.640 --> 23:53.600
organizations from who care about the protection of environment and large organizations who care

23:53.600 --> 24:02.240
about the right to repair and large organizations who care about free software that form an alliance

24:02.880 --> 24:12.320
and come up together with four core demands for a more sustainable digital society and

24:12.320 --> 24:19.680
i think this is a really huge success and will help us so much in the upcoming discussions

24:20.320 --> 24:29.680
on the equal design and making some things right hopefully okay um are individuals also able to

24:29.680 --> 24:36.160
sign your letter or is it just organizations no for now it's just organizations because i mean

24:36.160 --> 24:43.520
yeah what we want to achieve is we want to show politicians we want to show them there's a huge

24:43.520 --> 24:54.000
European civil society who supports these demands and uh having talked so much about these demands

24:54.080 --> 25:03.600
now the four demands that we came up with every uh so every user has the universal right to install

25:03.600 --> 25:07.120
any software any device so that's the first demand that we have in this whole letter

25:08.400 --> 25:16.880
the second is the right to to choose your online service because we especially like um with

25:16.880 --> 25:25.040
the internet of things or smart environments private smart environments i have devices and i

25:25.040 --> 25:32.480
have an online service connected to it so for example i have my smart whatever heating and there's

25:32.480 --> 25:43.600
an online provider who who regulates then to heat my living up or down then once the online service

25:43.600 --> 25:51.120
stops we have this problem now more and more the at some point the online service says okay that's

25:51.120 --> 25:57.120
not economic for us anymore we just stop the service then all the devices are also lost because

25:57.120 --> 26:03.120
they are not able to connect to another device so i as a user must have the right to choose my online

26:03.120 --> 26:08.160
service because this will also help a lot to you know having the possibility to reuse my device

26:08.880 --> 26:13.920
whatever online service i want to choose so it's not about the manufacturer to decide which online

26:13.920 --> 26:22.400
service i can use with my electronic device it's me who should choose it then the interoperability

26:23.120 --> 26:31.680
of devices that's the third one right exactly so that i'm not bound to uh like a product family of a

26:31.680 --> 26:41.360
specific um manufacturer so once i buy the i don't know the smartphone the smartphone from one

26:41.360 --> 26:45.280
manufacturer i also have to buy the computer from that and i have to buy the fridge from that and i

26:45.280 --> 26:51.200
have to buy the toaster from that just in order that all these devices smoothly integrate with each

26:51.200 --> 26:56.160
other and connect with each other and exchange information no they should exchange information

26:56.240 --> 27:03.520
based on open standards so i can choose the most whatever i'm looking for the most yeah

27:04.640 --> 27:14.400
and the fourth demand is the demand to publish tools drivers and specifications of any device

27:15.200 --> 27:23.200
under a free software license because this is crucial for the you know for the

27:23.760 --> 27:32.960
reusability of devices and for the repairability so yeah okay um so now we have talked a bit about

27:32.960 --> 27:38.080
the campaign and about the open letter and what you're doing with the campaign and how it's going

27:38.080 --> 27:44.560
so far so i was wondering you also mentioned the workshops could you elaborate a bit more

27:45.120 --> 27:50.880
the workshops as like those workshops are for people who want to flash their mobile phones and

27:50.880 --> 27:57.600
to unlock the bootloader right exactly so coming back from the open letter we want to achieve that

27:57.600 --> 28:03.600
everyone has the right to install any software any device but this is currently not the case

28:03.600 --> 28:10.640
because we talked about it manufacturers try to prevent me from doing it so it's sometimes a bit

28:10.640 --> 28:18.080
tedious and difficult to install a free software operating system on your mobile phone

28:18.320 --> 28:25.840
and that is why we set up the workshops in the first place so we can help users doing it

28:25.840 --> 28:29.760
users who are interested who have their phone and they want to keep using them longer

28:31.040 --> 28:37.600
they can come to the workshop and they can find help we have trainers there and they help people

28:37.600 --> 28:44.880
installing such a free software operating system the an explain of course also how it works

28:45.360 --> 28:49.680
of course people who are interested in so they can later on you know they can do this by

28:49.680 --> 28:55.280
himself they can maybe even in the best case they can even help their neighbor or they can tell

28:55.280 --> 29:01.360
other people and say hey where to find help and what if i just want to support upcycling android like

29:01.920 --> 29:08.640
if i'm not interested in doing anything else but i or if i already have done everything else and i

29:08.720 --> 29:12.160
also want to support the campaign how could i do this i mean

29:13.520 --> 29:20.560
every campaign lives by the word you know that people spread about it so if you like the idea

29:20.560 --> 29:25.680
about upcycling android go to upcyclingandroid.org you will find a lot of information material you

29:25.680 --> 29:30.480
find videos that you can share we have a campaign video but we also have

29:32.080 --> 29:37.600
recorded talks about the topic and so on so you can share the material you can share the

29:37.600 --> 29:43.600
campaign you can talk to people so this is always i think one of the most important things to do

29:44.080 --> 29:52.480
but also read it take it by your heart and i mean upcycling your own phone i mean that's

29:53.920 --> 30:02.480
that's really an interesting thing to do and in the end it will make a lot of fun

30:02.480 --> 30:10.240
you will learn a lot about your phone about sustainability you will also find a lot of help with

30:10.240 --> 30:19.440
people like if you are new to the topic go to a repair cafe maybe or to a hackerspace

30:20.880 --> 30:28.320
or to one of our workshops find some help do it by your own and this way you will learn a lot and

30:29.200 --> 30:34.640
yeah and get to know people who are also you know interested in topic and yeah that's how the

30:34.640 --> 30:44.880
community grows now i have my last question for you so i'm so sure that you know the campaign

30:44.880 --> 30:50.240
i love for a software day i have been working on this campaign for i think two years now

30:50.240 --> 30:55.760
and like a very nice campaign and i love it because it rises in the air it's my second favorite

30:55.760 --> 31:00.880
it's my second favorite campaign i have to admit your second favorite of course oh my gosh

31:00.880 --> 31:06.400
what's the first one after upcycling Android or maybe it's vice versa i cannot say that maybe they

31:06.400 --> 31:12.320
are on the same level okay oh my gosh i'm so glad to hear this because i think it's such an important

31:12.320 --> 31:17.040
campaign because it rises awareness of all the people that are behind free software and that are

31:17.040 --> 31:24.880
working so tirelessly throughout the year for our freedom yeah and it's always celebrated on the

31:24.880 --> 31:30.560
14th of february and i wanted to know who you would like to say thank you to is there a special

31:30.560 --> 31:36.880
project that you would like to say thank you or maybe are there many special projects so every year

31:36.880 --> 31:43.200
i have this problem this is a really difficult question because there's just so many

31:44.560 --> 31:51.840
uncountable projects i would love to think and i do think today i choose

31:52.800 --> 31:59.440
Macedon i'm using Macedon since i don't know for around four years now or so

32:00.160 --> 32:08.960
or those who don't know it so Macedon is an application in the in the fediverse so it's basically like

32:10.080 --> 32:17.040
it it feels a little bit like the proprietary twitter so you can write short text messages

32:17.280 --> 32:24.800
and attach a picture but it's free software and it's federating that means there's a lot of

32:24.800 --> 32:31.440
servers out there who connect with each other and who shared information and i think it's i just

32:31.440 --> 32:39.760
completely love the whole idea about decentralizing architectures and this is such a nice example

32:39.840 --> 32:49.280
of decentralized architecture that people can use to exchange and talk and share information

32:50.400 --> 32:57.680
and i have super nice discussions there i really love the community and it's really fun

32:57.680 --> 33:03.040
because just recently i mean since the big billionaire

33:03.760 --> 33:04.640
um

33:05.760 --> 33:13.520
allows to want to buy twitter there's a huge rush now on Macedon i hope that this will be you know

33:14.960 --> 33:20.880
it will stay like it is and all the people will enjoy it as we do it for now until now

33:21.920 --> 33:30.320
and it shows but it shows that i mean people want to communicate this is a really basic human

33:30.400 --> 33:39.360
need that we have and yeah Macedon gives us the way to communicate in freedom decentralized

33:40.000 --> 33:44.320
federated with free software and that's why i really love it

33:45.440 --> 33:53.680
