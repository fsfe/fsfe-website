    <title>Classification of Free Software as a World Cultural Heritage</title>
    <description>
     The goal was to have Free Software classified by UNESCO as an Intangible 
     World Heritage and registered in the World Memory Register (another UNESCO 
     project). The Free Software community and UNESCO share the same values of 
     freedom, equality and fraternity. Such recognition would be a great boost 
     for Free Software.
