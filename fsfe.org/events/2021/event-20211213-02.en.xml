    <body>
      <p>On Monday, 13th of December, the FSFE is organising the launch event of the recently translated Spanish "Public Money? Public Code!" brochure. The event will start at 18:00 o'clock and end at 19:30 o'clock, CET. We have invited numerous experts, like Luis Falcón, founder of GNUHealth, Ricardo Muñoz from Lliurex, Alexis Puente Montiel from Pica Pica HackLab, Ana Albalat Martínez and Francesc Busquets in representation of Linkat, and Aleix Pol Gonzalez, president of KDE for our upcoming launch event. Together with our experts we will explore the already implemented good practices, but also the challenges that lie ahead to modernise the public digital infrastructure with public code in Spain. For more information have a look at our <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/pmpc/ES/PMPC%20Evento%20Folleto.pdf">agenda</a> for the event. The event will be held in Spanish. <a href="https://registration.fsfe.org/PMPCeventoES">Registration</a> for the event is mandatory (but no costs are involved).
