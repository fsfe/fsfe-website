	Dear Zangemann,<br />
	I have been observing you for so many years. I’ve bought many of your hardware, but now I don’t like you because of how selfish you are. You keep controlling people. And the worst thing of all they are your own devices! You are the richest person in the world! So please don’t control people. Also you can start sharing your devices because you never know people might make them better!
