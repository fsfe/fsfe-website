        <title>REUSE talk in Vigo, Spain</title>

    <body>
      <p>Developing, using, and re-using Free Software is fun, but dealing with licensing and copyright information is not. REUSE changes that. With three simple steps, it makes adding and reading licensing and copyright information easy for both humans and machines. On Friday 24th of June at 16:30 CEST, Lina Ceballos, FSFE Project Manager, will guide us through the REUSE principles and present how to make licensing clear and simple with her presentation at esLibre2022 in Vigo, Spain. The event is in Spanish, free of cost, and no registration is needed. Everyone who is interested is welcome to join.</p>
