<h1>German elections+++ I Love FS Day+++ DMA, Ada, Router Freedom</h1>

<p>February started with FOSDEM! It was great to meet some of you there
before we meet again for “I Love Free
Software Day”! In recent weeks, we shared our demands for
the coming German elections, great news about Router Freedom, and an 
update about DMA. Moreover, the Ada movie is now available in French
and we published two podcast episodes.

<h3
id="german-elections">German Elections 2025: We demand public code,
secure funding for Free Software, and transparent measurement of
progress!</h3>

<p>The next German government must finally push for the controllability,
security, and sovereignty of the public digital infrastructure. As Free
Software is a prerequisite for this, <a 
href="/news/2025/news-20250206-01.html">the FSFE is making 4 key 
demands:
"Public Money? Public Code!", securing long-term funding for Free
Software, deepening Free Software knowledge in administrations, and
monitoring progress</a>. 
</p>

<h3 id="ilovefs">“I Love Free Software Day”: celebrate it with
us!</h3>

<h3 id="router-freedom">Router Freedom in Germany: A victory for
consumers!</h3>
<p>After a failed attempt by internet providers to exclude Router
Freedom from fiber networks, <a 
href="/news/2025/news-20250124-01.html">the German regulator BNetzA has 
confirmed
Router Freedom in the country</a>. The FSFE, which has been pushing for this
since 2013, will continue to monitor implementation and compliance.</p>

<h3 id="dma">The FSFE calls for broader interoperability by
Apple under the DMA</h3>
<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe, alongside civil society
organizations, developers, and researchers, submitted its position to the
European Commission’s public consultation on measures requiring Apple to
ensure compliance with the Digital Markets Act’s interoperability
provisions. The FSFE stressed the urgent need for Apple to provide
effective, free-of-charge interoperability. </p>

<p>Furthermore, on February 6, the FSFE participated in the "DMA and
Beyond Conference" organised by the Knight-Georgetown Institute and Yale
University in Washington, D.C. There, our volunteer Jithendra Palepu
presented a comprehensive study, elaborated upon by Lucas Lasota, FSFE's
Legal Programme Manager, on Apple's restrictive interoperability
policies and their harm to Free Software  in the context of the DMA.</p>

<h3 id="ada">The FSFE launches 'Ada &amp; Zangemann' movie in
French as Open Educational Resource</h3>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is releasing the animated film
‘Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry
Ice Cream’ <a
href="/news/2025/news-20250121-01.html">in French as an Open Educational Resource</a>. Originally a
highly successful illustrated book, now available in 10 languages and
counting, the story has been adapted into a film that can be freely used
in schools. </p>

<h3 id="social-media">The FSFE supports Dutch call to adopt social 
media platforms that respect public values</h3> <p>Last week six Dutch 
 civic organisations launched the campaign ‘Make Socials Social Again’. 
 They call upon public organisations to adopt social media platforms 
 that respect public values and thus are the real ‘social’ platforms. <a
 href="/news/2025/news-20250120-01.html">The FSFE joins this campaign</a> 
 to encourage a public debate on this. As stressed in the FediGov 
 campaign by the Swiss FSFE local team. It is important that platforms 
 used by public bodies enable independent and self-determined use of 
 technology. 
</p>

<h3 id="sfp">Software Freedom Podcast! Find out how South Tyrol
is taking a step in the direction of software freedom</h3>

<p>In our latest Software Freedom Podcast, Marta Andreoli, FSFE's Italian
deputy coordinator, talks to Paolo Dongilli, technical inspector of the 
Autonomous Province of Bozen-Bolzano - South Tyrol, about the FUSS 
project.
Together <a
href="/news/podcast/episode-29.html">they unravel how FUSS is helping the schools in South Tyrol</a>
take a step towards software freedom. </p>

<p>Also, we continued our series of episodes about Policy and the EU.
Last month, we talked about <a 
href="/news/podcast/episode-28.html">the two DevRooms that the FSFE organized at
FOSDEM 25</a>.</p>

<h3 id="community">From our community!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ada &amp; Zangemann themed mini game on the Luanti gaming platform:
thanks to Marco Amato -Zughy-, FSFE Italy volunteer and his team A.E.S., you can now pass your ice cream
cone to someone else before it melts in your hand. <a
href="https://codeberg.org/LuantiFSFE">Try it out!</a></li>

<li>A volunteer, who recently moved to South Spain, organized a reading and 
tinkering “Ada &amp; Zangemann session” at an art center  in Granada.
More than 20 children were able to tinker and play with technology as
well as learn about the story of Ada!</li>
</ul>
