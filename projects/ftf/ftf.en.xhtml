<p>The Freedom Task Force is an infrastructure project with a network of technical and legal experts that can help individuals, projects and businesses understand Free Software licensing and the opportunities that it presents.  The FTF works in partnership with gpl-violations.org to deal with licence violations in the European arena.</p>

<h2>Licence consultancy and education</h2>

<h2>Fiduciary services</h2>

<p>We can act as the legal guardian of Free Software projects.  We can consolidate and manage the legal side of things while you focus on ensuring your project reaches its full potential.  We can also help consolidate your copyright under your own administrative umbrella with the Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA). <a href="/projects/ftf/fiduciary.html">Learn more...</a></p>

<h2>Licence enforcement</h2>

<p>We work in partnership with <a
href="http://gpl-violations.org"
target="_blank">gpl-violations.org</a> to resolve licensing issues.  We seek to resolve problems for the long-term benefit of Free Software rather than regarding with each case as an isolated infringement.  We seek to educate people in how to properly use Free Software. <a href="/projects/ftf/enforcement.html">Learn more...</a></p>
