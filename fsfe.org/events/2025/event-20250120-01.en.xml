    <p>Why don't universities run their own Mastodon or Friendica instances in addition to their own email servers - for organisational units, professors and students? Why don't students get a Mastodon handle along with their email address when they enrol? Why don't universities host lecture videos in Fediverse via PeerTube? This is what some people at the Universtiy of Innsbruck asked themselves several months ago. So they made it happened.</p>
    <p>At this FSFE Women's Meeting, we are delighted to welcome Melanie Bartos, who led the initiative to establish a Mastodon instance and a Fediverse presence at the University of Innsbruck. Melanie will share her experience in persuading the university's management and IT staff to support the project, as well as the challenges she encountered along the way.</p>
  
      <p>This is a group for women who are interested in Free Software. We get together online once a month to chat, give talks about topics we care about and discuss recent developments.</p>
     <p>The group is women-centric and open to all women, inter, trans and non-binary people.</p>
