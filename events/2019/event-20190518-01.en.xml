    <title>Alexander Sander talks about Public Money? Public Code! at OSCAL in Tirana, Albania</title>

    <body>
      <p>Why is software that is programmed with taxpayersâ€™ money not released as Free Software? We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for public sector must be made publicly available under a Free and Open Source Software licence. If it is public money, it should be public code as well. Code paid by all people should be available to all people! </p>
<p>This talk of Alexander Sander, FSFEs Policy Manager, will provide a brief overview of the FSFE's previous and ongoing activities to foster software freedom in Europe on the levels of politics, legal work with enterprises, and general public awareness.</p>
