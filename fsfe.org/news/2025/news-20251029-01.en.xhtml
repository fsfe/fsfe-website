	<h1>Join the Free Software conversation at SFSCON 2025!</h1>

<p>Under the watchful gaze of the Dolomites, and with the
scent of chestnuts in the air, the city of Bolzano welcomes Free Software enthusiasts
to the South Tyrol Free Software Conference. Held every November, this
event brings together participants from Italy and beyond for two full
days of learning, sharing, and discussing the latest in Free
Software.

<p>The South Tyrol Free Software Conference (SFSCON) is just around the corner, and our
team cannot wait to join a full weekend of Free Software talks,
workshops, side events, and fun! We have already <a
href="https://www.sfscon.it/programs/2025/">checked the programme</a>
and it is full of interesting talks, with a track about health, 
engineering, cybersecurity…, all under the umbrella of this
year’s main topic: Ethics.</p>

<p>One of the first talks of the 2025th edition will tackle a compelling
ethical question at the intersection of health and technology: have you
ever considered how much modern healthcare relies on proprietary
products and infrastructure? Take, for example, a fundamental tool, the 
MRI used for disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring, and 
find out what the connection is to Free Software.</p>


<ul>
 <p><strong><a 
 href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/ethical-need-for-medical-devices-as-commons">Ethical 
 Need for Medical Devices as Commons</a></strong> by Martin Häuer from the 
 Martin-Luther Universität (Halle)and a supporter of the FSFE - Friday 7 
 November, 11:00 h.</p>
</ul>

<p>Of course next to all those amazing and inspiring talks our team will also 
	be on stage! Below, you can find our scheduled sessions for <a 
	href="#day-1-friday-7-november-2025">Friday</a> and
	<a href="#day-2-saturday-8-november-2025">Saturday</a>. We will also
	be around throughout the event, eager to say 
	hello, engage in inspiring discussions, answer your questions about our 
	work, and learn more about your passion for Free Software. And do not 
	forget to visit us at our booth, where you will find the latest FSFE 
	hoodies, stickers, and much more! </p>

<p>Still wondering what to do in Bolzano? In addition to the talks and workshops, SFSCON is 
packed with pre-events and side events taking place throughout the 
conference. And of course, we cannot forget the European SFS Award 
2025, which celebrates developers whose work has significantly advanced 
the accessibility and impact of Free Software in Europe. Last year,<a 
href="/news/2024/news-20241108-01.html"> this recognition was awarded 
posthumously to Bram Moolenaar</a>, creator of the widely used Vim text 
editor. Who will be this year’s winner?</p>

 medicine is not just about transparency or policy, but about dignity, 
 autonomy, and safety in contexts where code has real bodily 
 consequences</li> 
<li>13.30 h. - <strong><a 
href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/router-freedom-in-italy-latest-development/">Router 
Freedom in Italy: latest development</a></strong> <br/>The talk will present the

the wider network beyond text, highlighting video, image, and creative 
platforms such as Peertube and Pixelfed, along with opportunities for 
podcasters, streamers, and 3D artists. For newcomers, the presentation

ecosystem.</li> 


<li>18:40 h. - <strong><a 
href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/refund4freedom-freedom-to-choose-right-to-a-refund/">Refund4Freedom: 
Freedom to Choose, Right to a Refund</a></strong> <br/>Refund4Freedom is the campaign
