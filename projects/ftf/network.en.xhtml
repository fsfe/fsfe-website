  	<h1>The European Legal Network</h1>

<p id="introduction">
      The European Legal Network is a neutral, private network of legal
      professionals facilitated by FSFE. Delegates share knowledge and
      cooperate to increase the availability of best practice information
      about Free Software licensing. The network has over 250 participants
      across 27 countries and 4 continents, and it is the largest legal
      support structure for Free Software in the world.
    </p>

<p>The network occasionally produces public documentation to help people
explore and understand legal matters.  These are discussion documents and
the contents do not constitute legal advice or necessarily reflect the
opinions of any contributor.  You can find out more about these documents
on the independent network wiki hosted <a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/EuropeanLegalNetwork">here</a>.</p>

<p>FSFE has extensive legal contacts in Europe, and can help locate legal experts in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Greece, Germany, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands and the UK. FSFE can also provide introductions to experts in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the USA.</p>
