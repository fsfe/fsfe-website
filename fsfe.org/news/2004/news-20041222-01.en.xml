        Bo Versterdorf, President of the European Court, has today rejected
        Microsoft's appeal to delay execution of the sanctions.<br />
        "Those who value freedom and competition have received two nice
        christmas gifts this week.  First, new EU member Poland does not allow
        the introduction of innovation- and job-killer software patents
        through the diplomatic back-door.  And now the European Court decides
        that Microsoft should not get another four years to further harm its
        competitors" says Georg Greve, President of the FSFE.
