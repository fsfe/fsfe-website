  <p>What would you think about a sign on the highway saying “You need a
  Volkswagen to drive on this road. Contact your Volkswagen dealer for a gratis
  test drive -- Your Government”? When it comes to software that opens PDF
  files, many public sector organisations do this every day. </p>

</div>

<p>With the pdfreaders.org campaign we have turned the  spotlight on government
organisations who behave in this way, exposing how frequent such advertisements
for non-free software are.  With the help of activists across Europe, <a
     href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/follow-up.html">we contacted</a> these
   organisations and explained to them how to improve their websites so that
   they respect our freedom.</p>

<h2>Why should we care?</h2>

    <p>Even when a certain software is given away for free, the company
    behind it can have an economic gain: promoting that software means
    prioritising a specific company. Public bodies should not promote
    any specific private company, instead they should promote equality
    and choice on the software market. That is why FSFE and its volunteers
    intervened to fix the problem.</p>
    
    <p> This campaign was based on three core principles we support at FSFE:</p>

	  <ul>
		  
      <li>Neutrality - Public institutions should not engage in
        advertising</li>

      <li>Freedom - Public institutions should not ask citizens to use non-free
        Software</li>

      <li><a href="/activities/os/def.html">Open Standards</a> – The versions
        of the PDF format which are Open Standards can be implemented by all
        PDF readers</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>What did we achieve?</h2>

	  </div>

	  <p>Every day, public institutions advertise non-free software on 
    their websites. With the help of our Fellows and of hundreds other Free Software
    activists, we collected
    <a href="http://fsfe.org/campaigns/pdfreaders/buglist.html">2104 bug
    reports</a> over the course of one month from every country in Europe, 
    and also nine countries outside of Europe. </p>
    
    <p>Next, the FSFE and its volunteers
    sent letters to all the public administrations on our list asking
    them to either remove their advertising for proprietary  software,
    or to at least run equal advertising for Free Software, so  that
    users of their websites realise that they have a choice. In response,
    we received a lot of positive feedback from the institutions thanking
    us for our letters.
    </p>
    
    <p>Now, several years, and thousands of letters later, the FSFE has
    closed the campaign. Thanks to all the dedicated Free Software
    activists who helped contact institutions, we can proudly announce
    that  we were able to remove advertisements for proprietary PDF
    readers in 1125 or the 2104 public administration websites (53%).</p>

    <p>Furthermore, we were able to push for a change at both national and
    international levels.</p>
    
	  <ul>

      <li> In Germany, <a
href="http://gruen-digital.de/2012/03/document-freedom-day-kleine-anfrage-zur-werbung-fuer-adobe-reader-eingereicht/">national
parties</a> gave statements in favour of free PDF readers and the German
Government itself has recommended the usage of our text snippet in their <a
href="http://www.cio.bund.de/Web/DE/Architekturen-und-Standards/Migrationsleitfaden-und-Migrationshilfen/migrationsleitfaden_node.html">migration
guide</a>.  </li>

    <li> In the EU: the European Parliament 
    <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/parliamentary-questions-eu.html">directly asked</a>
    the European Commission what were the reasons for advertising a 
    specific software and which steps were taken to solve this problem.</li>

    <li> In 2011 one of our pdfreaders.org coordinators, <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/polina/2015/09/10/free-pdf-reader-for-the-web-browser/">
     Hannes Hauswedell, was in contact with Google</a>, asking them to release
    the PDF reader included in their Chrome browser as Free Software.
    Finally, in May 2014 the <a href="https://twitter.com/nasko/status/469595752734269440">
	pdfium sources were published openly</a>, and while FSFE's enquiry 
	might not have been the only reasons they were released, it marks an
	important change for the widespread adoption of Free Software PDF readers.</li>

    </ul>

 <p>In addition to contacting public institutions to resolve the  issue,
     FSFE also collected signatures from 90 organisations,  63  businesses,
     and 2731  individuals who demanded equal access for Free  Software 
     PDF readers.This wide-ranging support also demonstrated the  
     popularity of the  campaign overall. 
    </p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

    <p> The Free Software movement is, above all, supported by its 
    community; we always need your help to continue to help promote 
    free PDFreaders, and together we can make a difference for the 
    future of  Free Software! We encourage you to continue to 
    <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/letter.html">use our template and send letters</a> or emails to
     public bodies that are still advertising for proprietary software 
     and closed standards. We also have a link for tips on 
     <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/follow-up.html">how to follow-up with
     the relevant institution</a>. This is a great (and easy) activity for
     a local Free Software groups to spread Free Software knowledge in the 
     public administration.
