    On Thursday, November 13, there will be the next Berlin Fellowship meeting, as usual in the e-lok (near Ostkreuz). This time, Hagen will give a talk about the interconnection between freedom of software and hardware: "No Free Software without Free Hardware". As usual, the Fellowship meeting is a good possibility to meet other Fellows as well as other Free Software enthusiasts. You can get good food and best drinks at e-lok for a reasonable price and good mood for no cost. Official start is at 19:30.
