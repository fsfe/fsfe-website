<p newsteaser="yes">On Saturday, the 14 February, people all over the world
showed Free Software contributors their appreciation. It was the fifth year the
Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) asked people to participate at the “I
Love Free Software” day. This report shows a variety of love declarations that
happened this day including blog posts, pictures, comics, poems, and an
#ilovefs Android library. The FSFE thanks everybody who motivated Free Software
contributors this year, and ask everybody to mark 14 February 2015 in their
calendars for next year's “I love Free Software” day.</p>

<h2>Your cryptovalentine and our defenders of privacy</h2>

<p>This year many people focused their activities on -- <a
href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/gerloff/2015/02/13/i-want-to-love-the-future-thats-why-i-love-free-software/">what
FSFE's president Karsten Gerloff described as</a> -- “powerful tools that help
us defend and regain the freedoms we’ve lost, and the ones we’ve given up”: Our
sister organisation encouraged people to ask someone they like -- romantically
or otherwise -- <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/will-you-be-my-cryptovalentine">to be
their “cryptovalentine”</a>. <a
href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/ao/2015/02/14/i-love-free-software-day-gnupg/">André
Ockers</a>, <a
href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/mk/i-love-free-software-thanks-to-all-the-gnupg-contributors/">FSFE's
vice president Matthias Kirschner</a>, and many people in our <a href="/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.html">photo gallery</a> expressed their
appreciation to all the hardworking Free Software contributors who work for our
privacy like GnuPG, Tor, Tails, Chatsecure and many others.</p>

<p>In their <a
href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/celebrating-ilovefs-why-eff-loves-free-software">blog,
EFF explained why they love Free Software</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Without the freedom to fix security holes and share these
changes with others, nonfree software leaves computer users to fend for
themselves. Free software reintroduces a sense of solidarity amongst computer
users. Rather than developing a dependency on a single vendor, users are free 
to collaborate with others to add features and fix bugs. In contrast, changes
to proprietary programs depend on the whim of a program's
owner.”</p></blockquote>

<h2>Alone we can do so little. Together we can do so much</h2>

<p>There were also many people who praised the value of working 
together in the countless communities Free Software brought into world. 
There's for example <a 
href="https://colonelqubit.wordpress.com/2015/02/12/who-doesnt-love-free-software/">Robinson 
Tryon</a> who already is a very active part in some projects and urges 
others to acknowledge the people behind Free Software. Similar messages 
come from successful Free Software communities themselves who build 
upon the shoulder of giants. <a href="https://twitter.com/debian/status/566646558712930304">Debian</a>, 
<a href="https://dot.kde.org/2015/02/14/we-love-projects-around-us">KDE</a>, 
<a href="http://megaglest.org/news/35/31/Why-we-love-Free-Software">MegaGlest</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/openSUSE/status/566570111595999232">OpenSUSE</a>, <a 
href="https://owncloud.org/blog/we-love-free-software/">OwnCloud</a>, and others 
appreciate the many projects around them which they can learn from and 
also give back but also the vast number of individuals who participate 
by spending code, translations, documentation and valuable time in 
general. FSFE's <a 
href="http://matija.suklje.name/i-love-fs-2015">Matija Šuklje takes the 
same line</a> when saying that there are a lot of (not only) Free 
Software projects which inspire and impress him every day. And <a 
href="https://silkemeyer.net/ilovefs-2015-thank-you">Silke Meyer</a> 
also looks at the Free Software movement from a political viewpoint 
when stating that it is crucial for free communication between people 
and that we do not only need code but also the people who fight as 
activists for a free society:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Thanks to all those who do not contribute to free 
software projects but who work on this by political intervention, 
campaigning, activism! We can’t win this by just developing free 
software. But we can’t win it without free software 
either."</p></blockquote>


<h2>Love poems</h2>

<p><a href="http://framablog.org/2015/02/14/on-love-logiciel-libre/">Framasoft
published two beautiful but unfortunately untranslatable poems in French</a>
and in <a href="http://nicorikken.eu/blog/dia-i-love-you/">Nico Rikken wrote a
love poem</a> dedicated to the diagramming software “Dia”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Roses are red. Handles are green.<br />
You’re the finest diagramming software I have ever seen.<br />
Always there to help me out. And you ask nothing in return.<br />
Creating things together is all I really yearn.<br />
</p>
<p>
Dia I know we will be a great team.<br />
We can work together even upstream.<br />
So let this be my tag line:<br />
Would you be my Valentine?<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What else happened?</h2>

<p>There was a huge amount of messages in social networks, people expressed
their love in pictures (e.g. <a
href="/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.html">in our gallery</a>, or by <a
href="https://twitter.com/ViGLug/media">members of the Vignate GNU/Linux user
group</a>), posters were created (e.g. <a
href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B9ydnGXIQAADg0s.png:large">by Linda
Martinez)</a>, the <a
href="http://erack.org/blog/archives/51-I-Free-Software.html">Document
Foundation themed their bug tracker</a>, and Anatolij Zelenin wrote an <a
href="https://github.com/azapps/ilovefs-android">Android I love Free Software
Day library</a> which is already included in the Android app Mirakel.</p>

<p>Like in the last years we had many organisations and individuals thanking
Free Software contributors in articles. Beside the others mentioned before, for
example <a href="http://www.dariotordoni.eu/love-free-software/">Dario Tordoni
thanked the F-Droid developers</a>, <a
href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/jens.lechtenboerger/2015/02/14/i-love-free-software/">Jens
Leuchtenbörger wrote why he loves learning vocabulary with AnkiDroid in
combination with QuickDi</a>, and <a
href="http://blog.mehl.mx/2015/i-love-taskwarrior-therefore-i-love-free-software/">Max
Mehl thanks the contributors of Taskwarrior</a>, command-line task-management
tool.</p>

<p>We were happy to see many organisations expressing their love in other
languages than English, for example: <a
href="http://framablog.org/2015/02/14/on-love-logiciel-libre/">Framasoft (in
French)</a>, <a
href="http://blog.wikimedia.de/2015/02/14/wir-lieben-freie-software/">Wikimedia
Germany (in German)</a>, <a
href="http://www.kdeblog.com/amo-el-software-libre-ilovefs.html">KDE Spain (in
Spain)</a>


<a href="http://gruen-digital.de/2015/02/we-free-software-2/">the German Green
Party (in German)</a>, which also announced that they will soon hand in a
parliamentary enquiry about Free Software.</p>

<h2>Mark the date for next year!</h2>

<p>We hope all Free Software contributors out there were motivated through this
years #ilovefs day. But maybe all the people, who participated this year,
missed to thank <strong>your</strong> favourite Free Software program's
contributors. That is not a bug, it is a feature! Add a reminder to your
calendar for next year's #ilovefs-day on 14 February 2015 and thank those who
have been forgotten this year. (Of course you can also show your appreciation
for Free Software contributors during the year, too.)</p>
