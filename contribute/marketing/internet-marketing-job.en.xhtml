  <h1>Voluntary Internet marketer needed</h1>

<p>Digital freedom affects everyone, and in order to protect their rights people need to know about them. As well as attending community events and managing campaigns, FSFE needs to reach out to new audiences online and make use of tools provided by search engines.</p>

<p>Thanks to a generous targeted donation FSFE has the resources to run effective internet marketing campaigns, but we need the skills of a creative Free Software marketer to realise the potential.</p>

<p>The role would likely require just a few hours each week to monitor and adjust campaigns that you had configured. Assistance from other FSFE team members will be available via email should you need it.</p>

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create new Google Adwords campaigns</li>
<li>Research effective keywords for drawing new visitors to FSFE and other Free Software web pages</li>
<li>Monitor the effectiveness of keywords and adjust them accordingly</li>
<li>Be available to initiate new targetted campaigns for occasional FSFE projects</li>
<li>Provide a brief (less than 100 words) monthly report on your work and the status of FSFE's campaigns</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply</h2>

<p>Please email web@fsfeurope.org to express your interest, stating any relevant experience that you may have, and whether you are already an FSFE Fellow.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering the position!</p>
