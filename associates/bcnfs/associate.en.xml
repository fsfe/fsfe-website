          Barcelona Free Software is an organization which aims to unite the
          local Free Software community and spread Free Software values in
          Barcelona. They started in 2014 and since have met several times to
          discuss and celebrate different aspects of Free Culture ranging from
          Wikipedia and OSM to Clang. Their goal is to: Make sure the community
          is aware of local developments and teams; make sure there is someone
          to back Free Software locally by either becoming the contact or
          reaching to the right interlocutor if it is out of our scope; spread
          Free Software in Barcelona.
