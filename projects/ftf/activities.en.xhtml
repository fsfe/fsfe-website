        <h3>European Legal Network</h3>

        <p>
          FSFE facilitates the <a href="network.html">European Legal
          Network</a> (ELN), a neutral, private network of legal professionals.
	  Delegates share knowledge and cooperate to increase the availability
	  of best practice information about Free Software licensing. The
	  network has over 250 participants across 27 countries and 4
	  continents, and it is the largest legal support structure for Free
	  Software in the world.
        </p>

        <h3>Conference</h3>

        <p>
          We host the '<a href="legal-conference.html">European Legal
	  Network Conference</a>' to discuss the current market situation
	  and projected future for Free Software licenses.  This is the world's
	  premier event for debating, discussing and sharing knowledge around
	  Free Software legal affairs.

        <h3>Special Interest Groups</h3>

        <p>
          We organize Special Interest Groups to discuss topics ranging from
          business processes to license management. These groups
	  are designed to reduce misunderstandings, share knowledge and address
	  areas where there is a lack of available guidance.
