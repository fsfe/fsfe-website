<h1>Porque Software Libre</h1>

<body>
	<p>In the digital era, where technology and software fulfill an
	increasingly important role within society, policy, and the economy,
	the four freedoms of Software Libre are more relevant than ever:
	The freedom to <strong>use</strong> software without unnecessary restrictions, to 
	<strong>study</strong> how the software works, to be able to <strong>share</strong>
	it with whomever we wish, and the freedom to <strong>improve</strong>
	software to meet our own desires. Together, these freedoms offer access, 
	participation, and self-determination
	for everyone. On a larger scale, for the state of Spain, these freedoms
	provide a framework for public administrations to achieve greater
	digital autonomy, encourage local economic growth, and the potential to
	transform Spain into a technological leader in Europe.
	</p>
<p><h3>Free Software is a powerful tool that can</h3></p>

<p><h4>Strengthen our society</h4></p>
	<p>Releasing technology as Software Libre guarantees the right for everyone
	to use and share software with your neighbour, your colleague or anyone else.
	Each person or family, each institution, organisation or company,
	can benefit from cutting-edge technology without exclusion and without
	costs. From operating systems to the specialized application, people
	benefit from open access to technology. When the state creates and
	publishes a Software Libre application, platform, or service, it also
	provides a way to give back to the public what the public has indirectly
	paid for. That is why it should be mandatory to publish publicly
	funded software as Free Software.</p>
	
<p><h4>Increase our autonomy</h4></p>
	
	<p>The world of Software Libre is different. Software Libre is
	interoperable, its data is exportable and its source code is public.
	That reduces the chance for monopolies to form. The user and therefore
	the state gain autonomy through the removal of a technological monopoly
	and the associated dependencies for critical communication technology
	infrastructure.</p>
	
	<p>Given the interoperability of Software Libre, the state is free to
	switch suppliers and service providers instead of being tied to a
	client in a closed vendor solution. A public body can even develp
	software itself and, once developed, republish it as Software Libre
	to share it with other public institutions. A free license guarantees
	that the very same software is available to any other public
	institution without license-fees or any vendor dependency. This way,
	Software Libre offers the state the power to invest once, but benefit
	countless times.</p>
	
	<p>Software Libre offers transparency through its public source code.
	Transparency of the source code helps its contributors keep the code clean.
	There is no way to insert “secret” code into the software.
	Transparency helps the security of the software and avoids unwanted malfunctions.
	Only Software Libre can offer such a high level of security,
	and be run autonomously.</p>
	
<p><h4>Develop our economy</h4></p>

	<p>When the state buys a non-free solution, the money is most likely
	paid to global monopolies from abroad. Software Libre, however, offers
	Spain new economic avenues because the money can be invested into the
	national Spanish IT economy instead. The interoperability of Software
	Libre gives freedom to the state to switch suppliers and service
	providers as they wish. There is no need for a special contract with
	a particular supplier from a particular country. As everyone can access
	the source code and is free to use and improve the software, the Spanish
	state is free to hire local Spanish people or service companies to
	adapt existing software to its specific needs. Immediately, public
	administrations can offer jobs to the Spanish people to localize,
	maintain, develop and work on their very own interoperable and free
	operating system, including any applications that are needed.
	In this way, Software Libre offers the possibility to create national
	employment instead of paying companies from abroad.	Software Libre
	supports a decentralized economy that enables the distribution of
	wealth on local levels and brings employment directly to the people
	of Spain. The use and development of Software Libre offers Spain a
	path out of the crisis, and a chance to be at the forefront of the European 
	knowledge and information society.</p>

<p><h4>That is why</h4></p>
	<p>We ask the current and future government of Spain to rely on the
	flexibility, autonomy, freedom, wealth and transparency that Software Libre
	offers. And to migrate all state-run IT systems to Free Software, 
	including public administration and education.</p>

<p>With a clear commitment of the Spanish government to use and develop
Software Libre, the state of Spain can

<ul>
	<li>maintain and develop state-run IT systems autonomously from foreign
	    companies and instead hire local, Spanish people or companies that
	    create, maintain, and adapt new or existing software for its very own needs</li>
	<li>publish and share the software, so all public institutions and
	    the people of Spain can capture the benefits of Software Libre</li>
	<li>run secure and transparent software, instead of relying on non-disclosed
	    software by foreign companies</li>
	<li>localize and decentralize software into the diverse languages of
	    Spain and the specific needs of autonomous communities in Spain</li>
</ul>
