      <p>
      Every time we keep using our current phone instead of buying a new one we help avoid the production of new phones and the increase of e-waste. "Upcyling Android" is an initiative to overcome software obsolescence and to extend the lifespan of our hardware with the help of Free Software. Upcycling our devices this way is an important step to rethink our short-term, linear consumption of electronic devices in favor of a circular economy.
      </p>
      
      <p>On Saturday 21st of May 2022 we will host a FSFE-booth from 11:00 until 16:00 hour at the NLLGG meeting in Utrecht. As part of FSFE's 'Android Upgrade' campaign there will be a session at 12:00. In it Nico Rikken will show you the possibilities of installing a custom ROM with free software on your smartphone. After a talk that gives an overview there will be time to exchange experiences and see what steps are needed to make your Android device more free. The location is Gerrit Rietveld College, Eykmanlaan 1200, 3571 KH Utrecht. We look forward to have a chat with you about Free Software!</p>
