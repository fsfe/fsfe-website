        The OSB Alliance - Federal Association for Digital Sovereignty e.V. is
        committed to embedding into the public consciousness the important
        central role of Open Source Software (also called Free Software) and
        Open Standards in a digitally sovereign society. The association has
        been working since 2011 on establishing Free Software as the standard
        in public procurement, research, and business development, so that
        digital advancements benefit companies, governments, authorities and
        society alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to achieve these goals, membership in the OSB Alliance is open
        to companies, private individuals, the media, as well as political
        experts and contacts. The association works together with scientific
        institutions and user organisations and communities, and currently
        represents around 170 member companies, which together generate more
        than 1.7 billion euros annually in Germany.
