      As a Free Software developer and enthusiast, I'm most grateful to the
      wonderful people at the FSFE for doing all the hard work of campaigning,
      marketing and representing our shared interests in Brussels and
      elsewhere. Writing good software is one thing, but getting the word out,
      countering corporate lobbying, and working towards an environment where
      Free Software even gets a chance in public sector tenders is equally
      important. Being a supporter is an excellent way to support the FSFE
      towards those goals.
