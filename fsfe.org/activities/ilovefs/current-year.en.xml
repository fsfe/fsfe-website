		<h2>I ‚ô• Free Software Day 2025: Hidden projects</h2>

		<p>
		‚ÄúI Love Free Software Day‚Äù is a long-lasting tradition. On this 
		day, we thank all the people behind Free Software projects or programs 
		and let them know that their work does not go unnoticed. Let‚Äôs 
		celebrate all the wonderful people working for Free Software together: 
		join the ‚ÄúI Love Free Software Day‚Äù celebrations all over Europe. Get 
		in touch with your <a href="/about/groups.html">local 
		FSFE group</a> and organise a fun meeting.
		</p>

		<p>
		We are grateful to those who work and contribute to the Free Software 
		universe: developers, designers, translators, advocates, contributors, 
		users, and more. There are a lot of different Free Software 
		communities out there, with different values or different focuses in 
		their work. But we all contribute to Free Software and value the 
		freedom to use, study, share and improve software. Let's celebrate our 
		appreciation for Free Software and the people behind it with a simple 
		<q>Thank you!</q>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		For this 12th edition of the "I Love Free Software Day" we have a 
		special focus on Free Software projects that are not on the 
		front line. In a world that is becoming more and more digital, Free Software is 
		everywhere. It is in your car, on your router, on the servers that run 
		our daily infrastructure. Often these projects are hidden so they do not 
		get the focus they deserve to keep our daily lives up and running. 
		This year our celebrations will focus on those hidden projects.
