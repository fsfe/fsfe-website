      This year's <a href="http://fscons.org/">FSCONS</a> (Free Society
      Conference and Nordic Summit) takes place on November 13-15 and is
      co-organised by Fellows of FSFE. More than simply a conference,
      FSCONS is a meeting place for social change, focussing on the
      future of Free Software and how to build a Free Society on its
      principles. Please visit the <a
        href="http://wiki.fscons.org/">FSCONS Wiki</a> if you have ideas
      for the event or wish to get involved in any way.
