            I&#39;m a free sofware supporter for a long time, I fought against 
            software patents in Brussels, co-organised the system theme at the 
            Libre Software Meeting (RMLL) and run a Free Software company. Free 
            Software is an essential part of our global freedom, so it was natural 
            to become a Fellowship member at the FSFE.
