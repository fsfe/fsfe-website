      I&#39;m a Free Software supporter for a long time, I fought against
      software patents in Brussels, co-organised the system theme at the Libre
      Software Meeting (RMLL) and run a Free Software company. Free Software is
      an essential part of our global freedom, so it was natural to become a
      supporter of the FSFE.
