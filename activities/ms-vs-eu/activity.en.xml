    <title>Microsoft vs. EU Antitrust Case</title>
    <description>
      In 2001 the European Union started investigating Microsoft's
      dominant position in the market for desktop operating systems.
      The FSFE played two key roles in this case. First, we represented
      the interests of Free Software developers. Second, we are a
      public interest organisation who cannot be bought off. Thanks to
      the excellent work by all involved parties, the case has been won
      in all rulings up to the European Court of Justice in 2012.
