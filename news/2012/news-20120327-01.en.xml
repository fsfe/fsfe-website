    <title>Helping the European Parliament to release its own Free Software</title>

    <body> 
     For the first time, the European Parliament is planning to
     release one of its own applications as Free Software. During a
     meeting in the Parliament on July 11, FSFE President Karsten
     Gerloff and General Counsel Carlo Piana explained why Free
     Software matters for democracy, and discussed the right license
     for the AT4AM application with the Parliament's development team.
