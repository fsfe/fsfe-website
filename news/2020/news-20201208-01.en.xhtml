<h1>German Corona tracing app available without Google services</h1>

<p>
  A handful of Free Software developers today achieved what official
  bodies have been missing for months: They have made available the
  German Corona Warn App for tracing Covid-19 risk contacts in a
  version that is completely free of dependencies on Google and
  available in F-Droid, the Free Software app store.
</p>

<p>
  Already in April this year, the FSFE <a
  href="/news/2020/news-20200402-02.html">formulated two fundamental
  requirements for so-called Corona apps</a>. First, there must be no
  obligation to use them, and second, they must be available as Free
  Software. At first glance, the German <em>Corona Warn App</em> (CWA)
  published in June, meets these criteria, like many others in Europe
  by now. However, the exchange of device keys via Bluetooth, on the
  basis of which the risk is calculated, is handled by an underlying
  interface.

<p>
  The problem is that this interface software, called <em>Exposure
  Notifications API</em> and significantly developed by Apple and
  Google, is largely proprietary. This means it cannot be freely used,
  investigated, distributed and improved. In Google's Android operating
  system it is also necessary to install and use the Play Services.
  These Google services intervene deeply in the system and undermine
  the digital sovereignty of the users. By default, this prevents the
  use of many Corona apps for people who value <a
  href="/activities/android/">privacy and software freedom on their
  Android devices</a>.
</p>

<h2>Volunteers solve problems step by step</h2>

<p>
  A first major improvement was provided by Free Software developer and
  FSFE supporter Marvin Wißfeld in September. He <a
  href="https://mastodon.social/@larma/104630652216622243">built the
  exposure notification functionality into microG</a>, a Free Software
  implementation of the proprietary Google services. This allows at
  least people who own a <a href="/activities/android/">Google-free
  Android phone</a> and have microG installed to use various Corona
  apps.

<p>
  A few days ago, Christian Grigis, Fynn Godau, Marcus Hoffmann and
  Marvin Wißfeld went one step further. They <a
  href="https://codeberg.org/corona-contact-tracing-germany/cwa-android">integrated
  the exposure notification component of microG directly into the
  German Corona Warn App</a>. This so-called Drop-In-Replacement
  enables even people who have neither the Google services nor their
  Free Software alternative microG installed, to use the CWA. In
  addition, as of today they are <a
  href="https://f-droid.org/packages/de.corona.tracing/">making the app
  available on F-Droid</a>, an app store with exclusively Free
  Software. This is therefore also advantageous for those users who
  have installed microG or Google services, but prefer to obtain their
  software via F-Droid for security and convenience reasons.
</p>

<p>
  microG main developer and FSFE supporter Marvin Wißfeld adds:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "The previous solution of installing microG is often out of the
    question for various reasons. But the new app from F-Droid,can also
    be run without problems on all current smartphones from, for
    example, Huawei some of which have been delivered without Google
    services since mid-2019. The German government and the RKI may have
    lost thousands of users of the Corona Warn App in recent months,
    as only Google and Apple users were targeted."
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  It is now up to the responsible bodies, the German government, the
  Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and their contractors SAP and T-Systems,
  to <a
  href="https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/issues/1483#issuecomment-734491614">incorporate
  the changes into the main development branch</a>, and thus to pull
  together with the Free Software community. In addition, this method
  can in principle also be used for Corona apps in other countries.
</p>

<h2>Free Software once again in a pioneering role</h2>

<p>
  We see a familiar pattern here: the Free Software community <a
  href="https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/issues/5">presents
  a problem and a possible solution</a>, but is <a
  href="https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/issues/5#issuecomment-627848335">turned
  away</a> until volunteers solve the problem themselves with unpaid
  work and without official support. In this case, the resources of the
  authorties and companies involved would have easily sufficed to make
  these significant improvements themselves, or at least to support
  them. It is laudable that the CWA was consistently developed and
  published as Free Software from the very beginning, but it lacked the
  necessary consistency to remove technically and meanwhile unnecessary
  dependencies on proprietary software.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE appeals to governments and administrations to publish
  developed software as Free Software, to break dependencies on
  Google's and Apple's app stores and instead make their apps
  installable from independent sources like F-Droid, and to renounce
  proprietary dependencies. As Wißfeld explains, the Corona Warn App
  already offers concrete additional advantages in the fight against
  the pandemic:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "The free implementation has the potential - in the spirit of Free
    Software - for improvements that Google's proprietary interface
    does not allow. For example, it would be possible to display the
    time of a high risk encounter. This could - if the user voluntarily
    provides the data - help public health authorities to identify
    hotspots or clusters, or be used for statistical purposes to
    increase the effectiveness of protective measures."
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  We would like to thank all persons involved who made the use of the
  Corona App in Germany possible without having to accept any loss of
  software freedom.
