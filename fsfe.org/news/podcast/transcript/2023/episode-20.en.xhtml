Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:17.240 --&gt; 00:21.680
This podcast was presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe, the R Charity

00:21.680 --&gt; 00:24.800
that it powers users to control technology.

00:24.800 --&gt; 00:29.760
I'm Bonnie Mehring and our guest for today's episode is Lukas Lasota.

00:29.760 --&gt; 00:34.480
Lukas has a background in contract and technology law, and he's also teaching at the Humboldt

00:34.480 --&gt; 00:40.400
University in the fields of civil IT and telecommunication law.

00:40.400 --&gt; 00:45.520
Apart from this work at the university, Lukas also works for the FSFE as a senior project

00:45.520 --&gt; 00:46.520
manager.

00:46.520 --&gt; 00:52.200
At the FSFE, he focuses on several initiatives connecting law and technology.

00:52.200 --&gt; 00:57.080
Among those, Lukas works for device neutrality and narrative freedom.

00:57.080 --&gt; 01:00.840
For this episode, we will break down these topics and cover their technical background

01:00.840 --&gt; 01:03.240
and their impact on society.

01:03.240 --&gt; 01:07.200
Thank you so much for being here, Lukas, and welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

01:07.200 --&gt; 01:08.200
Hi, Bonnie.

01:08.200 --&gt; 01:10.000
It's my great pleasure to be here.

01:10.000 --&gt; 01:14.720
Lukas, you also work for the FSFE, but where does your interest for free software comes

01:14.720 --&gt; 01:15.720
from?

01:15.720 --&gt; 01:25.720
Well, I'm a lawyer as a profession, and I always study different areas of law, copyright,

01:25.720 --&gt; 01:33.600
patent law, and usually we take this for granted that the system works just on this direction,

01:33.600 --&gt; 01:39.280
on this way, but the free software is truly a revolution on how copyright and patent

01:39.280 --&gt; 01:42.840
law is in fact applied in society.

01:42.840 --&gt; 01:49.600
So basically, copy left, for example, is a heck of the copyright system, and for me

01:49.600 --&gt; 01:56.640
that was just a genius movement, and that's why I found the law, and I said, I need to take

01:56.640 --&gt; 01:58.240
part on this.

01:58.240 --&gt; 02:05.080
So you came to FSFE to a law point of view, so it was not a technical background.

02:05.080 --&gt; 02:12.320
Like, you didn't think, oh, I need to have FSFE, so I can help to improve to software

02:12.320 --&gt; 02:15.880
or other than able to use the software for anything that I want.

02:15.880 --&gt; 02:24.360
It was more about how does free software and law interconnect, and the whole concept

02:24.360 --&gt; 02:26.160
of copy left.

02:26.160 --&gt; 02:33.080
Yes, and this is the beauty of the movement, right, because it puts together technical

02:33.080 --&gt; 02:41.360
people, policy people, lot people all working for making software free, right?

02:41.360 --&gt; 02:48.360
And that was the appealing part to me, that traditional institutions, legal institutions,

02:48.360 --&gt; 02:53.960
legal instruments, were being interpreted and used in a completely different way in order

02:53.960 --&gt; 02:59.920
to safeguard freedoms and not to restrict freedoms, and that was for me a game changer.

02:59.920 --&gt; 03:03.680
Thank you for sharing this background, sir, Milukas.

03:03.680 --&gt; 03:07.080
How and why did you join the FSFE?

03:08.080 --&gt; 03:17.240
Yes, so after having this completed turnaround in my life, and I start thinking about what

03:17.240 --&gt; 03:25.680
should I do now, I start researching about free software, and I wrote some legal articles

03:25.680 --&gt; 03:31.560
on free software, and I started learning more, reading a lot.

03:31.560 --&gt; 03:36.680
And in that term point, I said, perhaps I could also do it for a living.

03:36.680 --&gt; 03:39.920
I could perhaps start working with it.

03:39.920 --&gt; 03:49.800
And then in 2018, I saw that the FSFE was hiring, and I applied, and I was very proud

03:49.800 --&gt; 03:56.280
and happy that they accepted me, and I have been working for the FSFE since 2019.

03:56.280 --&gt; 03:57.280
That's quite a long time.

03:57.280 --&gt; 03:58.280
Yes, it's amazing.

03:59.280 --&gt; 04:06.360
During this whole time, what was the best thing that you can remember by working for the

04:06.360 --&gt; 04:09.800
FSFE and connected to free software?

04:09.800 --&gt; 04:17.120
Oh, this is a very hard question, because I have so much good moments, and I'm optimistic

04:17.120 --&gt; 04:24.520
that I still have a lot of good moments, but I think that the community is a great part

04:24.520 --&gt; 04:25.520
of it.

04:26.240 --&gt; 04:35.080
Learning and with people that has a completely different view on things, it's really something

04:35.080 --&gt; 04:36.080
different for me.

04:36.080 --&gt; 04:45.040
I mean, I have learned so much in these four years that I say that perhaps I went again

04:45.040 --&gt; 04:49.960
in the academy of life learning on how to control technology.

04:49.960 --&gt; 04:54.800
So I think the learning process with the community has been the best aspect for me.

04:54.960 --&gt; 04:56.440
I really like that, Lucas.

04:56.440 --&gt; 04:59.560
Thank you so much for sharing this with me.

04:59.560 --&gt; 05:04.360
So as we already established, you have been working for the FSFE now for quite a long

05:04.360 --&gt; 05:05.360
time.

05:05.360 --&gt; 05:11.600
During this time, what are the main areas you worked for, or the main focus you had,

05:11.600 --&gt; 05:13.760
and did this change over the time?

05:13.760 --&gt; 05:14.760
Right.

05:14.760 --&gt; 05:22.040
So since my background as law, I've been working several activities in the legal and

05:22.040 --&gt; 05:24.040
policy field.

05:24.040 --&gt; 05:32.680
Together with my colleague, Gabriel, we facilitate, for example, the FSFE legal network, and

05:32.680 --&gt; 05:36.040
we work also in several legal initiatives.

05:36.040 --&gt; 05:42.800
One of my favorites, because I think this initiative can really change the landscape

05:42.800 --&gt; 05:47.760
of the internet of the future, is the next generation internet.

05:47.760 --&gt; 05:56.320
And we provide hundreds of software projects, help, and organize their license compliance.

05:56.320 --&gt; 06:04.320
And for example, we help them implement our reuse specifications, and between other legal

06:04.320 --&gt; 06:05.320
initiatives.

06:05.320 --&gt; 06:13.480
In the policy side, I've been working mainly in helping people to control their own devices

06:13.480 --&gt; 06:15.560
with the help of free software.

06:15.560 --&gt; 06:22.800
In this regard, I've been spearheading the device neutrality initiative and the router-free

06:22.800 --&gt; 06:24.840
to campaign.

06:24.840 --&gt; 06:30.120
What is device neutrality, and what does this include?

06:30.120 --&gt; 06:35.520
This is a fundamental concept, and to explain this, I would like to start with an example.

06:35.520 --&gt; 06:41.720
Let's imagine that you have bought a smart phone, a shiny new smart phone, right?

06:41.720 --&gt; 06:46.800
And you are thrilled to learn and discover all that your device can deliver.

06:46.800 --&gt; 06:52.320
You want it to install apps, use camera, access the internet, run games, enjoy all that

06:52.320 --&gt; 06:54.480
your equipment can perform.

06:54.480 --&gt; 07:01.000
However, I think everybody who has bought his smartphones in the last years faced this

07:01.000 --&gt; 07:02.000
problem.

07:02.000 --&gt; 07:07.720
You begin to perceive that something is not quite correct, I would say, because in order

07:07.720 --&gt; 07:13.080
to start your phone, you are prompted to create an online account for using this device.

07:13.080 --&gt; 07:14.480
This is the first thing.

07:14.480 --&gt; 07:22.680
Secondly, you start to perceive that you are limited in how you download or install new

07:22.680 --&gt; 07:25.520
apps and programs.

07:25.520 --&gt; 07:32.040
Perhaps you are allowed only to download new apps through the manufacturers or the vendor's

07:32.040 --&gt; 07:34.640
app store or marketplace.

07:34.640 --&gt; 07:40.960
Then you are forbidden to install 30-party software, or if you wanted to install different

07:40.960 --&gt; 07:47.360
repository, for example, F-Droid, you are not allowed, and most weirdly, you are not

07:47.360 --&gt; 07:50.880
allowed to remove pre-installed programs.

07:50.880 --&gt; 07:54.880
And this is really a serious issue, right?

07:54.880 --&gt; 08:02.880
Because you are not allowed to remove programs that are occupying the device memory, space,

08:02.880 --&gt; 08:08.520
or training its battery, or even worse, it's proprietary and you don't know what the

08:08.520 --&gt; 08:10.440
program is doing.

08:10.440 --&gt; 08:16.320
So perhaps you wanted to change the operating system and you are not to do that.

08:16.320 --&gt; 08:23.840
So basically, just to sum up, this sad example that I think every consumer today in digital

08:23.840 --&gt; 08:29.960
markets are facing, although digital devices are ubiquitous today.

08:29.960 --&gt; 08:36.200
The number of devices on which users cannot run free software is exponentially increasing,

08:36.200 --&gt; 08:41.560
and the consequence is an increasing loss of control over user technology.

08:41.560 --&gt; 08:52.960
So device neutrality aims to enable consumers and users, we, to bypass these restrictions

08:52.960 --&gt; 08:56.640
and to use free software on devices.

08:56.640 --&gt; 08:59.800
This is all the device neutrality is all about.

08:59.800 --&gt; 09:06.200
So basically, the name stands for devices should be neutral?

09:06.200 --&gt; 09:13.720
Right, so the concept of neutrality here, and this is not a concept that was invented

09:13.720 --&gt; 09:15.440
by the FSFE.

09:15.440 --&gt; 09:21.600
Device neutrality has been around for quite some time already in Europe, I, for example,

09:21.600 --&gt; 09:24.560
already since 2013, 2014.

09:24.560 --&gt; 09:30.160
There were already some movements in Italy to make this concept to reach a legislation,

09:30.160 --&gt; 09:36.400
but unfortunately, it lost some momentum and track there, but also the academic sector

09:36.400 --&gt; 09:40.840
has been working a lot in order to define in this.

09:40.840 --&gt; 09:47.080
So basically, and the academic sector, there's a lot of studies in the last three years

09:47.120 --&gt; 09:55.000
working on this, and they, they realize that manufacturers, for example,

09:55.000 --&gt; 10:01.200
smartphones, manufacturers or vendors are even internet platforms.

10:01.200 --&gt; 10:12.680
They control specifically, specific points in the device architecture or in the device

10:12.680 --&gt; 10:22.240
infrastructure, that prohibits end users to perform the term functions of this device.

10:22.240 --&gt; 10:30.040
For example, as we just said, it's not possible to install different app stores or repositories

10:30.040 --&gt; 10:37.600
or it doesn't allow to, to uninstall, pre-installed applications.

10:37.600 --&gt; 10:42.480
So basically, these manufacturers and these vendors are even internet platforms.

10:42.480 --&gt; 10:47.760
They have a monopoly on the terms aspects of the device.

10:47.760 --&gt; 10:55.160
And when they have this, this monopoly, they act as a gatekeeper.

10:55.160 --&gt; 11:02.120
They have a weak gatekeeper function controlling these aspects, these elements of devices.

11:02.120 --&gt; 11:11.720
And they can, I can put this, and they can discriminate, they can discriminate in what

11:11.720 --&gt; 11:18.400
functions or what software you can install on uninstall or can run or not run in it.

11:18.400 --&gt; 11:26.080
So the neutrality aspect here, the concept of neutrality is that, is to let users to run

11:26.080 --&gt; 11:32.280
any software that they want in order to explore the functionality of the device.

11:32.280 --&gt; 11:41.000
In fact, this sense, they should be neutral to what the device can do, okay?

11:41.080 --&gt; 11:48.120
All right, so it should be my choice, what kind of software I install on the device,

11:48.120 --&gt; 11:51.320
rather than the choice of the vendor.

11:51.320 --&gt; 12:00.080
Right, of course, that when you buy a smartphone or a computer or a tablet or, you know,

12:00.080 --&gt; 12:05.040
this kind of device is that we are using today, that usually I like to call,

12:05.120 --&gt; 12:12.760
there are general purpose computers, right, that you can run software, we are kind of any free software,

12:12.760 --&gt; 12:13.840
when you buy it.

12:13.840 --&gt; 12:22.520
Well, there are consumers that want to have indeed software already running to it,

12:22.520 --&gt; 12:24.720
that you can already start using it.

12:24.720 --&gt; 12:32.240
Other users prefer to have only the device that they can install by themselves operating systems,

12:32.240 --&gt; 12:42.840
they can, you know, adapt and to configure the device in ways that he or she wants,

12:42.840 --&gt; 12:45.760
but it is a choice.

12:45.760 --&gt; 12:52.440
Yes, so the device, since it's a general purpose computing, it has the capacity

12:52.440 --&gt; 12:58.960
and this capacity to permit users to run the software that they want,

12:58.960 --&gt; 13:05.640
especially when regards to free software, should be protected, should be safeguarded,

13:05.640 --&gt; 13:09.920
and that's what we want with this initiative.

13:09.920 --&gt; 13:13.000
All right, thank you so much for covering the basics of me.

13:13.000 --&gt; 13:21.760
What would you say are the problems that users are facing if device neutrality is not a given standard?

13:21.760 --&gt; 13:30.720
Right, so as I said, the manufacturers, the vendors, the internet platforms,

13:30.720 --&gt; 13:40.720
the gatekeepers, this concept, they control crucial aspects of device operating systems,

13:40.720 --&gt; 13:45.880
app stores, browsers, and perhaps even key online services.

13:45.920 --&gt; 13:51.080
And in general terms, these gatekeepers, they achieve this control,

13:51.080 --&gt; 13:58.440
they achieve this monopoly by a restricting software freedom.

13:58.440 --&gt; 14:03.040
So gatekeepers limit or prevent users installing different operating systems,

14:03.040 --&gt; 14:08.440
browsers that today is very important because we are using browsers more and more,

14:08.480 --&gt; 14:21.200
we are spending more time in browser, using the internet and so gatekeepers,

14:21.200 --&gt; 14:28.480
they restrict our ability to run free software, they restrict software freedom.

14:28.480 --&gt; 14:34.840
But they also lock the device down, they hinder interoperability, for example,

14:34.880 --&gt; 14:42.400
they exercise type control over APIs, they apply proprietary standards,

14:42.400 --&gt; 14:47.440
they hamper functionalities and block access to drivers and hardware.

14:47.440 --&gt; 14:56.880
And they also put end users and consumers inside silos, if we can say like this, if you will,

14:56.880 --&gt; 15:01.280
and they increase switching costs of the devices.

15:01.320 --&gt; 15:07.200
Gatekeepers keep users in these wallet gardens or in silos,

15:07.200 --&gt; 15:14.120
they tie devices to online accounts, bundle app stores and hamper data portability,

15:14.120 --&gt; 15:18.320
making it harder for users to switch software devices or event services.

15:18.320 --&gt; 15:25.640
So basically these are the difficulties that consumers are facing with their devices nowadays.

15:25.680 --&gt; 15:31.240
And how is the FSFE and especially you in this case, supporting device neutrality?

15:32.920 --&gt; 15:40.080
Right, so first we need to understand the causes and we have been,

15:40.080 --&gt; 15:46.840
yeah, as I said, using a lot of concepts that has been developed over the years

15:46.840 --&gt; 15:52.480
by regulators, by the academic sector,

15:52.480 --&gt; 15:58.680
by the free software community itself, because when we see today,

15:58.680 --&gt; 16:04.680
there's a lot of free software alternatives that help users to have much,

16:04.680 --&gt; 16:07.120
much more control over devices.

16:07.120 --&gt; 16:14.760
For example, alternative app stores, alternative browsers, drivers and et cetera.

16:14.760 --&gt; 16:21.600
And we had to adapt to the concept of device neutrality

16:21.600 --&gt; 16:26.600
to and from the perspective of a free software.

16:26.600 --&gt; 16:31.560
And we came out with demands when someone asks,

16:31.560 --&gt; 16:37.240
so what the FSFE is asking for device neutrality?

16:37.240 --&gt; 16:42.680
And in order to use is to regain control over devices,

16:42.680 --&gt; 16:49.360
we think that device neutrality translates into a software freedom.

16:49.400 --&gt; 16:53.920
Regaining control of devices requires safe guiding software freedom.

16:53.920 --&gt; 16:58.720
Users should have the ability to install and uninstall any software,

16:58.720 --&gt; 17:02.000
including operating systems and app stores.

17:02.000 --&gt; 17:07.400
Gatekeepers should provide users the same access privileges

17:07.400 --&gt; 17:10.640
to third party applications as to the pre-installed ones.

17:10.640 --&gt; 17:12.240
So this is very important.

17:12.240 --&gt; 17:19.240
But not only that, we are also against B lock-ins.

17:19.240 --&gt; 17:23.600
We advocate for higher degrees of interoperability,

17:23.600 --&gt; 17:27.360
why the implementation of open standards

17:27.360 --&gt; 17:31.680
in the different aspects and dimensional of devices.

17:31.680 --&gt; 17:36.440
And we promote easier access to APIs specifications

17:36.440 --&gt; 17:40.240
and functionalities invoked by 30-parties apps.

17:40.240 --&gt; 17:47.160
So, and we also the third point

17:47.160 --&gt; 17:50.440
that composed our understanding of device neutrality

17:50.440 --&gt; 17:56.120
is that end users should have control over data in their devices.

17:56.120 --&gt; 18:00.600
So breaking monopolies over devices necessarily requires

18:00.600 --&gt; 18:04.800
empowering users to control their own data on their equipment.

18:07.000 --&gt; 18:11.000
That's why end users should be able to easily transfer personal data

18:11.000 --&gt; 18:15.280
from apps operating systems and across devices.

18:15.280 --&gt; 18:24.520
Most importantly for us, the formats of the standards

18:24.520 --&gt; 18:28.080
that this data portability and this data interoperability

18:28.080 --&gt; 18:30.880
should be, should abide, open standards

18:30.880 --&gt; 18:35.440
and common interfaces for data transfer.

18:35.440 --&gt; 18:41.720
However, all these demands, they are materialized

18:41.760 --&gt; 18:45.280
in several initiatives that we have been running

18:45.280 --&gt; 18:47.800
in the last years.

18:47.800 --&gt; 18:52.560
For example, we engaged with European institutions

18:52.560 --&gt; 18:55.840
in the legislative process of digital markets act.

18:55.840 --&gt; 18:59.480
It's a very important legislation

18:59.480 --&gt; 19:01.600
that entered in force last year.

19:01.600 --&gt; 19:06.000
But we have been working with several decision makers

19:06.000 --&gt; 19:09.680
and policy makers in order to promote

19:09.680 --&gt; 19:14.960
device neutrality principles that I just mentioned in the law.

19:14.960 --&gt; 19:19.480
And we were very happy to see that several of them

19:19.480 --&gt; 19:21.920
were established in the law.

19:21.920 --&gt; 19:26.080
So now we can say that device neutrality,

19:26.080 --&gt; 19:27.800
at least in the legislative level,

19:27.800 --&gt; 19:30.360
is already a reality in Europe.

19:30.360 --&gt; 19:35.320
But we need to work further to implement this on practice.

19:35.360 --&gt; 19:40.600
And this leads perhaps to one also a different activity

19:40.600 --&gt; 19:44.800
that I've been working in the FSFE that is router freedom.

19:44.800 --&gt; 19:48.000
And in this case, we now come to router freedom

19:48.000 --&gt; 19:52.640
as this is the other campaign that you're working on.

19:52.640 --&gt; 19:54.400
What is router freedom about?

19:54.400 --&gt; 19:58.920
Could you quickly recap the connection to device neutrality

19:58.920 --&gt; 20:05.000
for me and how router freedom came into life?

20:05.000 --&gt; 20:06.000
Right.

20:06.000 --&gt; 20:12.080
So as you mentioned, device neutrality is, although it's

20:12.080 --&gt; 20:15.680
very simple to understand, the demands for it

20:15.680 --&gt; 20:19.800
is just we require software freedom on devices.

20:19.800 --&gt; 20:24.920
We advocate against locking, vendor locking

20:24.920 --&gt; 20:30.000
in devices, and users should have control over data.

20:30.000 --&gt; 20:35.720
These are very close, basic to the free software community.

20:35.720 --&gt; 20:39.920
Because historically, that's what the community

20:39.920 --&gt; 20:42.160
has allowed to do with free software.

20:42.160 --&gt; 20:43.560
And free software power is usually

20:43.560 --&gt; 20:45.800
to do this with devices, right?

20:45.800 --&gt; 20:51.400
But the bigger the gatekeepers are,

20:51.400 --&gt; 20:55.560
more control they have over the supply chain.

20:55.560 --&gt; 21:00.160
And more control they have over those bottlenecks on devices.

21:00.160 --&gt; 21:03.240
And that's why implementing device neutrality

21:03.240 --&gt; 21:05.760
and practice is challenging.

21:05.760 --&gt; 21:09.120
Because in the end, we have to challenge

21:09.120 --&gt; 21:12.960
the economic and policy power of these very large

21:12.960 --&gt; 21:15.680
and powerful companies.

21:15.680 --&gt; 21:22.120
But router freedom is a very dedicated also initiative.

21:22.120 --&gt; 21:25.920
Because it deals with a very basic level

21:25.920 --&gt; 21:28.040
of device neutrality.

21:28.040 --&gt; 21:34.920
We want that users and consumers have the right

21:34.920 --&gt; 21:40.160
to choose their own devices when connecting to the internet.

21:40.160 --&gt; 21:40.960
Period.

21:40.960 --&gt; 21:42.480
That's very simple.

21:42.480 --&gt; 21:46.880
So router freedom is that you should be able to choose

21:46.880 --&gt; 21:50.160
your own router or modern.

21:50.160 --&gt; 21:53.400
But even on this level of simplicity,

21:53.400 --&gt; 21:56.160
at least conceptual simplicity, in Europe

21:56.160 --&gt; 22:00.080
has been very hard to implement this.

22:00.080 --&gt; 22:03.560
And router freedom has been running already for years.

22:03.560 --&gt; 22:06.120
And we have been experimenting.

22:06.120 --&gt; 22:10.160
And we have been engaging with policymakers, with regulators,

22:10.160 --&gt; 22:16.360
in several levels, in the national level, in the European level,

22:16.360 --&gt; 22:21.520
in order to make this a reality.

22:21.520 --&gt; 22:25.360
We defend, we argue, and we advocate,

22:25.360 --&gt; 22:33.520
that users should not be obliged to use only the router

22:33.520 --&gt; 22:37.320
that the internet services provider gives them.

22:37.320 --&gt; 22:40.120
And sometimes they give these routers to users,

22:40.120 --&gt; 22:43.480
and they also charge for it.

22:43.480 --&gt; 22:48.400
So they are making money twice with routers.

22:48.400 --&gt; 22:52.160
And all that we want is that end users

22:52.160 --&gt; 22:55.760
should have the ability to just buy their own routers

22:55.760 --&gt; 23:01.880
and to run and to install free software on their routers.

23:01.880 --&gt; 23:06.120
And because there are free software operating

23:06.120 --&gt; 23:10.160
systems for routers, and that's all.

23:10.160 --&gt; 23:15.600
And what perhaps someone can say, but is that important?

23:15.600 --&gt; 23:18.160
Router is perhaps just this equipment

23:18.160 --&gt; 23:20.760
that nobody cares is getting there,

23:20.760 --&gt; 23:25.280
getting a little bit dusty in the corner of your room.

23:25.280 --&gt; 23:33.960
But no, I would like to highlight that routers

23:33.960 --&gt; 23:38.680
are very important piece of equipment.

23:38.680 --&gt; 23:40.520
Let's put this way.

23:40.520 --&gt; 23:44.560
Your whole internet traffic, encryption, backups,

23:44.560 --&gt; 23:47.400
communication, shopping, writings, business

23:47.400 --&gt; 23:51.880
interaction, and so on, are transferred over the internet

23:51.880 --&gt; 23:52.920
through your router.

23:52.920 --&gt; 23:55.600
So the router is your gateway to the internet.

23:55.600 --&gt; 24:00.520
If your router is not free, your digital freedoms

24:00.520 --&gt; 24:02.440
are like to be compromised.

24:02.440 --&gt; 24:05.760
So that's why router freedom should be understood

24:05.760 --&gt; 24:08.440
as quite important.

24:08.440 --&gt; 24:10.640
And it affects everybody, because everybody

24:10.640 --&gt; 24:15.360
or nearly everybody is using a router.

24:15.360 --&gt; 24:21.160
And this is for, like, it affects a lot of people.

24:21.160 --&gt; 24:24.800
And as you already said, it's quite,

24:24.800 --&gt; 24:27.560
sometimes it's a bit hard to think about a router

24:27.560 --&gt; 24:31.840
as something very important that you should run free software

24:31.840 --&gt; 24:35.560
on it, because it is the device that

24:35.560 --&gt; 24:40.080
channels all your communication.

24:40.080 --&gt; 24:42.160
As I said, I completely agree with you,

24:42.160 --&gt; 24:44.960
but that router freedom is not merely

24:44.960 --&gt; 24:46.880
top for expect.

24:46.880 --&gt; 24:48.840
It affects all of us.

24:48.840 --&gt; 24:52.880
And the problem is, is that historically,

24:52.880 --&gt; 24:57.120
internet services providers, they

24:57.120 --&gt; 25:01.280
thought that the router would be an element

25:01.280 --&gt; 25:03.120
of their own infrastructure.

25:03.120 --&gt; 25:06.640
So it would be their equipment that they

25:06.640 --&gt; 25:09.240
would put inside our own home.

25:09.240 --&gt; 25:15.760
But it's not like this, because already in the 80s,

25:15.760 --&gt; 25:17.600
this has changed.

25:17.600 --&gt; 25:24.280
And as with telephones, already we saw in the history

25:24.280 --&gt; 25:27.440
of the telecom sector, that telephones,

25:27.440 --&gt; 25:32.760
they started to be understood as a private equipment.

25:32.760 --&gt; 25:37.320
And people could change their own telephones that they wanted.

25:37.320 --&gt; 25:39.800
And it's the same with routers.

25:39.800 --&gt; 25:43.920
But I just wanted to point out that every time

25:43.920 --&gt; 25:48.960
that new technology emerges, gatekeepers or telecom

25:48.960 --&gt; 25:52.720
providers, they usually take a very restrictive approach

25:52.720 --&gt; 25:55.480
to this, and they wanted to keep this equipment

25:55.480 --&gt; 25:59.600
under their own control and not giving users control over it.

25:59.600 --&gt; 26:03.920
So they always raise arguments of security,

26:03.920 --&gt; 26:07.480
of integrity, of the network, and et cetera.

26:07.480 --&gt; 26:12.960
But our experience has shown that the risks of end users

26:12.960 --&gt; 26:16.880
using their own equipment to the public network

26:16.880 --&gt; 26:18.120
is very, very low.

26:18.120 --&gt; 26:20.960
It's very low.

26:20.960 --&gt; 26:26.000
But the benefits for users having their own equipment

26:26.000 --&gt; 26:28.160
is much greater.

26:28.160 --&gt; 26:34.880
So basically, router freedom allows the router market

26:34.880 --&gt; 26:38.120
to thrive, because with more competition,

26:38.120 --&gt; 26:41.760
there are several types of routers that people can use

26:41.760 --&gt; 26:47.440
and can adapt and can configure it to their own needs.

26:47.440 --&gt; 26:54.040
So people can update the parentheses of the routers by their own,

26:54.040 --&gt; 26:56.600
so avoiding security issues.

26:56.600 --&gt; 27:00.760
So router freedom, in fact, benefits not only users,

27:00.760 --&gt; 27:03.600
but benefit the entire digital ecosystem.

27:03.600 --&gt; 27:06.080
It benefits the digital markets as well.

27:06.080 --&gt; 27:08.280
So that's why with router freedoms,

27:08.280 --&gt; 27:13.120
we invite internet service providers

27:13.120 --&gt; 27:18.360
to take a more lax approach and to allow end users

27:18.360 --&gt; 27:20.840
to use their own routers.

27:20.840 --&gt; 27:26.560
But I would say that this has to be done through regulation.

27:26.720 --&gt; 27:30.520
Because without regulation, the tendency

27:30.520 --&gt; 27:33.800
is that ISPs, internet service providers,

27:33.800 --&gt; 27:36.920
they take a very restrictive approach to this.

27:36.920 --&gt; 27:39.600
We have been quite successful on this front.

27:39.600 --&gt; 27:45.600
I must say, Bonnie, that on the regulatory front,

27:45.600 --&gt; 27:47.880
we have been interacting and working

27:47.880 --&gt; 27:51.440
with regulators all over Europe.

27:51.440 --&gt; 27:56.120
And I'm happy to tell you that several countries

27:56.120 --&gt; 27:58.040
already adopted router freedom.

27:58.040 --&gt; 28:03.040
For example, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland,

28:04.840 --&gt; 28:09.000
most recently, in last week, Greece

28:09.000 --&gt; 28:13.600
has also started regulating router freedom.

28:13.600 --&gt; 28:17.400
We have high hopes for Belgium, for example.

28:17.400 --&gt; 28:20.560
So we have been monitoring the entire landscape

28:20.560 --&gt; 28:23.880
and we have been working with regulators

28:23.880 --&gt; 28:29.840
to tell them why router freedom is important,

28:29.840 --&gt; 28:32.360
not only for end users' perspective,

28:32.360 --&gt; 28:35.960
but for consumer protection, for competition,

28:35.960 --&gt; 28:38.160
for sustainability, because users

28:38.160 --&gt; 28:40.280
can use longer their own routers

28:40.280 --&gt; 28:44.240
and not have to change device frequently.

28:44.240 --&gt; 28:46.280
So these are mainly the arguments

28:46.280 --&gt; 28:49.520
that we have been trying to bring to regulators.

28:50.520 --&gt; 28:53.200
As you already mentioned,

28:53.200 --&gt; 28:57.480
the status of router freedom is getting better and better.

28:57.480 --&gt; 29:00.840
I hear that you also have a survey for this.

29:01.960 --&gt; 29:04.200
Can you tell me a bit more about the survey

29:04.200 --&gt; 29:08.960
and who can participate in it?

29:08.960 --&gt; 29:12.160
What does it ask you for questions?

29:12.160 --&gt; 29:15.720
Is it an expert survey or does everybody can take part?

29:16.680 --&gt; 29:17.520
Right.

29:17.520 --&gt; 29:21.880
So this survey has been running already for some time

29:21.880 --&gt; 29:26.880
and our audience is quite broad.

29:27.680 --&gt; 29:29.520
There is a question on the survey

29:29.520 --&gt; 29:31.360
that you can do a self-assessment

29:31.360 --&gt; 29:34.080
if you see yourself as an expert or not,

29:34.080 --&gt; 29:37.400
but every opinion counts.

29:37.400 --&gt; 29:40.760
Because one issue that we have been facing the last years

29:40.760 --&gt; 29:44.560
is that even regulators, they don't have a clear picture

29:44.560 --&gt; 29:48.400
of the problems that end users are facing with their own routers.

29:48.400 --&gt; 29:51.840
And we wanted to change this raising empirical data

29:51.840 --&gt; 29:56.000
to show them what kind of problems end users are facing

29:56.000 --&gt; 29:57.840
with their own router.

29:57.840 --&gt; 30:02.840
In 2016, a law on net neutrality was introduced in Europe

30:06.600 --&gt; 30:08.840
and one of the articles of this law

30:08.840 --&gt; 30:11.160
is saying that end users have the right

30:11.160 --&gt; 30:14.360
to choose their own terminal equipment.

30:14.360 --&gt; 30:20.360
And we have been working on this law to make this a reality.

30:20.360 --&gt; 30:23.720
But the problem is with the teleconsector is that

30:23.720 --&gt; 30:25.120
in order to implement this right,

30:25.120 --&gt; 30:27.160
there is a lot of technical regulations

30:27.160 --&gt; 30:30.960
that should be implemented by telecom regulators

30:30.960 --&gt; 30:37.560
and sometimes they can take a relatively physical approach to this right.

30:37.640 --&gt; 30:43.720
And we would like to avoid this showing them

30:43.720 --&gt; 30:48.160
that there are violations of this very basic right.

30:48.160 --&gt; 30:50.440
There's a violation of net neutrality

30:50.440 --&gt; 30:55.520
when users are not being allowed to use their own routers.

30:55.520 --&gt; 31:01.320
I'm happy to say that this survey is a success

31:01.360 --&gt; 31:07.640
because more than 1,300 end users,

31:07.640 --&gt; 31:11.040
so people all over Europe had took part on this

31:11.040 --&gt; 31:13.600
and they have been related a lot of problems

31:13.600 --&gt; 31:16.080
that they have been encountered.

31:16.080 --&gt; 31:21.440
So this has been very helpful for us to trace

31:21.440 --&gt; 31:23.160
and to map these problems.

31:23.160 --&gt; 31:27.680
But we also ask them if they think that router freedom is important

31:27.680 --&gt; 31:33.760
and it's quite nice to see that more than 90% of the respondents

31:33.760 --&gt; 31:36.680
said that they think that router freedom is important.

31:36.680 --&gt; 31:38.600
Router freedom is important for security.

31:38.600 --&gt; 31:42.040
Router freedom is important for their old questions that we put there.

31:42.040 --&gt; 31:47.680
And so yeah, these are the results of the survey

31:47.680 --&gt; 31:53.760
that we are planning to publish in the coming weeks in the coming months.

31:53.800 --&gt; 31:57.560
But are the next steps for router freedom?

31:59.520 --&gt; 32:06.520
Right, so yes, it's not a given effect nowadays.

32:06.840 --&gt; 32:10.320
So we have a lot of work in front of us

32:10.320 --&gt; 32:15.320
and we will continue to work on this in the years to come.

32:15.320 --&gt; 32:23.320
So a device neutrality, as I said, it became a reality just last year.

32:23.680 --&gt; 32:26.600
And a legislative reality, I would say.

32:26.600 --&gt; 32:29.440
But as I just mentioned with router freedom,

32:29.440 --&gt; 32:34.440
there was a law in 2016 already grinned in this to end users.

32:34.440 --&gt; 32:39.680
And in 2023, this is not a reality still in Europe, right?

32:39.680 --&gt; 32:44.240
So it requires a lot of engagement of civil society actors.

32:44.240 --&gt; 32:47.120
It requires a lot of work.

32:47.120 --&gt; 32:53.120
And that's why I think that the type of efforts

32:53.120 --&gt; 32:59.200
that we are making within the FSFE to make this reality,

32:59.200 --&gt; 33:03.440
yeah, it's something that we need to keep doing

33:03.440 --&gt; 33:06.480
and not to take that for granted.

33:06.480 --&gt; 33:12.720
And is there anything that people can do to participate

33:12.720 --&gt; 33:16.520
and to support router freedom or device neutrality?

33:16.520 --&gt; 33:18.520
Absolutely, absolutely.

33:18.680 --&gt; 33:22.800
So I'll start with router freedom.

33:22.800 --&gt; 33:26.560
So router freedom, you can participate,

33:26.560 --&gt; 33:31.560
taking part on our survey, the link is on our website.

33:35.160 --&gt; 33:36.400
You can...

33:36.400 --&gt; 33:37.600
And in the show notes.

33:38.640 --&gt; 33:44.640
Yes, and help us understanding better the situation on our country.

33:44.720 --&gt; 33:47.560
There are countries that we have a lot of information already,

33:47.560 --&gt; 33:52.000
for example, in Germany, are in other countries

33:52.000 --&gt; 33:53.800
where router freedom is a reality.

33:53.800 --&gt; 33:56.320
But there is too room for improvement.

33:56.320 --&gt; 33:59.160
So we really would like to see engagement from people

33:59.160 --&gt; 34:00.760
from other countries as well.

34:01.840 --&gt; 34:06.160
And you can talk to other people about it.

34:06.160 --&gt; 34:10.760
You can, for example, if you know how to configure a router,

34:10.760 --&gt; 34:12.920
if you know how to use a router,

34:12.920 --&gt; 34:16.320
perhaps you can talk to your colleagues, to your friends,

34:16.360 --&gt; 34:20.880
to your family, that perhaps they should update the router

34:20.880 --&gt; 34:25.880
and to have a router that is perhaps more suitable to them.

34:28.400 --&gt; 34:32.840
You can also support us, right?

34:32.840 --&gt; 34:36.320
In our work, you can translate our texts.

34:36.320 --&gt; 34:38.320
It's the same for device neutrality.

34:38.320 --&gt; 34:43.120
So the situation with device neutrality

34:43.120 --&gt; 34:44.480
is a little bit more complex

34:44.480 --&gt; 34:47.280
because when you buy your smartphone,

34:47.280 --&gt; 34:51.200
sometimes you are not allowed to do that.

34:51.200 --&gt; 34:55.360
But if you have this ability

34:55.360 --&gt; 34:57.920
with your device to install free software,

34:57.920 --&gt; 35:02.560
please do so and help free software projects.

35:02.560 --&gt; 35:05.960
Install FDroid on your smartphone, for example,

35:05.960 --&gt; 35:09.760
use more free software on your devices.

35:09.760 --&gt; 35:12.360
Install, try to install perhaps

35:12.360 --&gt; 35:15.800
a free software operating system on your laptop,

35:15.800 --&gt; 35:18.640
contribute to this project,

35:18.640 --&gt; 35:23.240
in strength of the community, spread the word

35:23.240 --&gt; 35:25.760
because we need to have a flourish

35:25.760 --&gt; 35:30.560
and health community in order to make our rights a reality.

35:30.560 --&gt; 35:32.080
Thank you so much, Lucas.

35:33.320 --&gt; 35:35.120
Thank you. It was a pleasure to be here.

35:35.120 --&gt; 35:38.320
And not yet quite done.

35:38.320 --&gt; 35:41.720
The last question that I have for you is,

35:41.720 --&gt; 35:46.800
you have all this connection with technology, society.

35:46.800 --&gt; 35:50.360
You pointed out how people can participate.

35:50.360 --&gt; 35:53.160
But what would be the software that you say,

35:53.160 --&gt; 35:54.920
oh, the software is so awesome.

35:54.920 --&gt; 35:57.760
My life would be different without the software.

35:59.760 --&gt; 36:01.560
I love free software activities.

36:01.560 --&gt; 36:03.960
One of my favorites within the FSFE.

36:03.960 --&gt; 36:07.960
And if you check, perhaps my stars on social media

36:07.960 --&gt; 36:10.080
on Macedon, you see that every year,

36:10.080 --&gt; 36:15.440
I have a huge list of free software that I'm thinking

36:15.440 --&gt; 36:20.440
because all of them makes our life easier, nicer,

36:23.480 --&gt; 36:27.160
and it allows us indeed to control technology.

36:27.160 --&gt; 36:31.280
I would be a little bit unfair in this opportunity

36:31.280 --&gt; 36:33.960
that you're giving me here in this very important podcast.

36:33.960 --&gt; 36:37.160
Just think just one software.

36:37.200 --&gt; 36:43.720
Because, as I said, taking on a broader perspective,

36:43.720 --&gt; 36:45.440
there is a lot of them.

36:45.440 --&gt; 36:50.440
And there also in back end also software

36:51.240 --&gt; 36:54.720
that allows this front end software to run, right?

36:54.720 --&gt; 36:58.360
And there is this infrastructure software running on servers

36:58.360 --&gt; 37:02.800
and in other elements that allows these applications

37:02.800 --&gt; 37:05.320
that we are now using.

37:05.320 --&gt; 37:08.160
And more and more that we are working with device neutrality,

37:08.160 --&gt; 37:13.160
we see how important drivers and all of these frameworks

37:13.720 --&gt; 37:17.080
are also very important in order to allow people

37:17.080 --&gt; 37:19.440
to control technology.

37:19.440 --&gt; 37:23.200
Therefore, I would like to thank generously

37:23.200 --&gt; 37:27.880
all the free software developers who have been working hard.

37:27.880 --&gt; 37:31.480
Sometimes without nobody saying taking

37:31.480 --&gt; 37:34.680
or without financial contributions,

37:34.720 --&gt; 37:37.440
but I just want to say that their work

37:37.440 --&gt; 37:40.360
is very, very important for all of people

37:41.360 --&gt; 37:44.320
that are trying to safeguard

37:44.320 --&gt; 37:47.400
or to have better policies on for their digital rights.

37:48.320 --&gt; 37:49.160
Thank you very much.

37:49.160 --&gt; 37:51.240
This was a nice closing word.

37:51.240 --&gt; 37:54.880
And also, as you already said, it's very important

37:54.880 --&gt; 37:59.560
to say thank you to them and to show our gratitude,

37:59.560 --&gt; 38:03.240
but to also sometimes support free software financially

38:03.240 --&gt; 38:06.280
and to not take it for granted or others work on it.

38:06.280 --&gt; 38:09.080
Yes, thank you very much for having me here.

38:09.080 --&gt; 38:10.840
It was a glitch pleasure.

38:10.840 --&gt; 38:11.640
Thank you, Lucas.

38:11.640 --&gt; 38:12.640
Awesome to have you here.

38:12.640 --&gt; 38:14.160
Thank you so much.
