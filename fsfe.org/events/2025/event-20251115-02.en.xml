      <p>Platform regulation is a hot topic. Not only the EU but several countries are regulating big tech’s enormous economic power.</p>
     <p>The DMA in the EU is an example of such regulation, aimed at devices manufacturers, app stores, search engines, browsers and cloud services. The law impacts Free Software due to a series of obligations related to interoperability, side loading and installing of apps. Big tech is very reactive to this law. For instance, Apple started three litigations against the Commission due to the enforcement of the DMA.</p>
     <p>This talk will explain why regulating big tech is key for Free Software, and what steps were taken by the FSFE to protect Free Software in such challenging processes.</p>
