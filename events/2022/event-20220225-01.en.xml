    <body>
	  <p>Are you interested in the new book Ada &#38; Zangemann: A tale of 
	  software, skateboards, and raspberry ice cream? The book is a modern fairy tale that conveys the joy 
	  of tinkering and calls for self-determined use of software: for 
	  children from 6 years of age. A charming story that adults can 
	  also enjoy. </p>
	  
	  <p>
