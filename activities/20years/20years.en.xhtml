<div id="introduction">
    
    <p><strong>
		The Free Software Foundation Europe turns 20. This means two 
		decades of empowering users to control technology. Two decades 
		of helping individuals and organisations to understand how Free  
		Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and 
		self-determination.
    </strong></p>

    <p>
		We would like to take a breath and look back on the road we 
		have come, to reflect the milestones we have passed, the 
		successes we have achieved, the stories we have written and the 
		moments that brought us together and which we will always 
		joyfully remember.
    </p>

    <p>
		But it is not just about the FSFE itself: for our 20th birthday 
		we want to give momentum to our pan-European community, the 
		community that has formed and always will form the shoulders 
		that our movement relies on. <strong>20 Years FSFE is meant to 
		be a celebration of everyone who has accompanied us in the past 
		or still does.</strong> Thank you for contributing your piece 
		of the puzzle that shapes the FSFE and setting the foundation 
		for the next decades&#39; work of the movement for software 
		freedom.

<h3 id="a-birthday-message-from-our-president-matthias-kirschner">A 
message to you from our President Matthias Kirschner</h3>
  
    <p>
        Although technology is ever-changing, our values have been 
        consistent throughout the last twenty years. The core of our work 
        is, in a nutshell: educating people on the nature of Free Software, 
        highlighting its political implications, and simplifying its legal 
        preconditions. Matthias Kirschner, President of the FSFE since 
        2015, explains this in his own words in a short video.

    <p>
        We contacted people who paved the way of the FSFE since its 
        beginning, such as long term volunteers and past staffers. In a series 
        of interviews we discuss the progress of the FSFE as well as 
        technological topics.

        So many things have happened in the last 20 years! Countless of hours 
        that members of our community have spent running booths, giving talks, 
        holding workshops, organise meetings, do lobbying and more. 
        Unfortunately we miss a lot of visuals from these activities! We would 
        love to fill up our archive with all the great things you were doing in 
        support of our cause!

<h2 id="Highlights-from-the-last-20-years">Highlights from the last 20 years</h2>

  <p>
	In 2021 the well-known FSFE looks back on a successful history with 
	major success in the public, legal and political field. For example 
	in 2005, when our intense <a 
	href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2004q2/000057.html">campaigning</a> 
	and collaboration with other organisations persuaded the European 
	Parliament to <a 
	href="https://lists.fsfe.org/pipermail/press-release/2005q3/000109.html">vote</a> 
	against Software Patents. Or two years later, when the European 
	Court of Justice court aligned with the FSFE, <a 
	href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.html">requiring 
	Microsoft to publish interoperability information</a>. It was 
	during that time that the need to support Free Software developers 
	by clarifying the legal aspects of their work, such as the 
	enforcement in case of license violations, led to the FSFE starting 
	to work with Free Software legal advocates and practitioners for 
	legal initiatives in 2006.
  </p>

  <p>
	Meanwhile, the FSFE maintains <a 
	href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/ln.en.html">the world&#39;s 
	largest professional network on legal issues related to Free 
	Software</a>. The FSFE&#39;s legal experts on this network help 
	with concrete licensing consultancy for all. To this end we also 
	created the highly successful <a 
	href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> initiative to provide a 
	set of recommendations that make licensing Free Software projects 
	easier for developers. REUSE has been adopted by well known 
	projects such as the German Corona Warn App and the KDE.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	Since its founding, the FSFE is committed to running public 
	campaigns, helping people to understand the benefits of Free 
	Software. As early as 2012, we helped users to overcome software 
	restrictions in their phones with the launch of our <a 
	href="https://fsfe.org/activities/android/">&#39;Free Your 
	Android&#39; campaign</a>. Two years earlier we introduced <a 
	href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ilovefs/index.en.html">&quot;I 
	love Free Software day&quot;</a> which is celebrated around the 
	globe every year on 14 February. In 2017, we launched the 
	extraordinarily successful <a 
	href="https://publiccode.eu/">&#39;Public Money? Public Code!&#39; 
	campaign</a>, convincing several public administrations to change 
	their IT strategy. The accompanying  <a 
	href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">open letter</a> is signed 
	by several public administrations like the city of Barcelona and 
	the Swedish JobTech Development center, over 200 civil society 
	organisations and more than 31.000 individuals.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Of course, all these accomplishments can only give a glimpse on 
    the impact of the FSFE and our activities in the last 20 years.
