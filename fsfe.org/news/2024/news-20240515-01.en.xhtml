<h1>Ada goes to the set: let’s make an animated movie</h1>

<p>
What do a Prime Minister, an MIT professor, and a child from Rajasthan 
have in common? They, along with other public figures and thousands of 
children, love the illustrated book 'Ada &amp; Zangemann: A Tale of 
Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream'. Ada has already made it 
into homes and libraries around the world, and now she needs your help 
to reach even more kids! Help us make a film of this story to spark more 
 kids’ interest in coding and tinkering!</p>

'Ada &amp; Zangemann: A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice 
Cream', tells the story of the famous inventor Zangemann and the girl 
Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment with hardware and 
software, and in the process realises how crucial it is for her and 
others to control technology.
</p>

<blockquote>"A brilliantly illustrated journey of discovery and resilience that will 
inspire any young mind to embrace their curiosity and create with 
technology." <br/>
- Zach Latta, Founder of Hack Club
</blockquote>

<p>
The story has been translated into several languages and reached 
thousands of children and adults through public readings. Now, we want 
to go one step further and create a 30 minute movie about Ada’s story! 
This movie, released as an Open Educational Resource, will be a tool to 
encourage more children, especially girls, to tinker and learn how to 
code, while fostering inclusiveness and accessibility. <a href="/donate/donate.html">Help us to 
achieve this goal!</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
"I like how [the story] makes a positive statement that girls can code 
and use computers." <br/>
- Child Reviewer, Purdue
</blockquote>

<p>
Girls have often been discouraged from getting involved in technology 
and becoming tinkerers and coders, which has led to technology being 
largely designed by men for men. Ada shows girls and young women that 
they can shape technology for the future they want.
</p> 

<blockquote>"The license choice also favors translations of the work, which gave me 
the idea of a collaborative educational project for its French 
translation." <br/>
- Alexis Kauffmann, Project manager, French Ministry of 
Education and Youth</blockquote>

<p>
Thanks to our volunteers and the FSFE’s supporters the story is already 
available in 9 languages and we are working on more. More than 18,000 
copies of Ada’s story have found their way into the hands of kids around 
the world, and we have been able to reach more than 1,400 children with 
readings, follow-up discussions, and workshops.
</p> 

<blockquote>"A wonderfully entertaining read with an empowering message for younger 
generations, one which will shape our world and the way we live in it."<br/> 
- Kaye Fogarty, teacher from a school in Marbella who did a reading with her students
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="/donate/donate.html">Your contribution will help us</a> to work on the 2D animated version of the 
book to reach an even wider audience so more children, especially girls, 
can hear and watch this story that encourages curiosity and tinkering. 
Everyone will be able to download and share it, use it in schools, and 
integrate it with other educational material, making a difference to the 
quality of IT education that is so vital for young people in our digital 
society.
</p>

<blockquote>
"This modern tale is a superb parable, and a perfect illustration of the 
need for digital freedoms in our daily lives. The tone is positive, 
laughing, and optimistic for the future, so that new generations will be 
stronger than we have been." <br/>
- JB Kempf, President, VideoLAN 
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="/donate/donate.html">Your support will make a difference!</a> It will help us to create this 
movie but also to continue to spread the story of Ada through readings 
in different languages, and to encourage others to do so!
</p>

<blockquote>"This book is exactly what I want to pass on to my children!" <br/>
- Canelle A., 18-year-old student translator in a Parisian high school </blockquote>
