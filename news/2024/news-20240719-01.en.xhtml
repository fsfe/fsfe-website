<h1>EC cuts funding support for Free Software projects</h1>

<p>The Next Generation Internet initiative has supported Free Software 
projects with funding and technical assistance since 2018. Despite its 
proven success, the European Commission made the decision to cut this 
funding in the current draft for the Horizon Europe 2025 Work 
Programme. This decision highlights the larger problem of the lack of 
motivated and sustainable public funding for Free Software projects.

<p><a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">The Next Generation Internet (NGI)</a> initiative has been a project of 
the European Commission’s (EC) Horizon Europe programme since 2018. It 
provides funding for scientific research and innovation that can 
improve the Internet as a platform, including for the development of 
Free Software. The FSFE has always been a part of this initiative as a 
consortium member in the NGI Zero (NGI0) sub-group, where we provide 
legal and licensing support to more than 400 Free Software projects 
funded by the initiative.</p>

<p>As the EC works on the future plans for Horizon Europe, the FSFE is 
disappointed to learn that NGI is no longer mentioned as part of the 
plans for the Horizon Europe funding drafts and work programmes for 
2025. The lack of public funding to such crucial technologies 
negatively impacts not only Free Software but the whole future of the 
Internet.</p> 

<h3>A blow to the vast NGI ecosystem</h3> <p>NGI is structured to 
 support a large number of organizations and individuals working on open 
 digital technologies, through open calls and <a 
 href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/funding-tenders-opportunities/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=25559615">a 
 cascade funding system</a>. Through this system, the NGI allocates its 
 budget to fund crucial open technologies of the Internet. Open assets 
 include Free Software, Open Hardware, Open Data, Privacy Enhancing 
 Technologies, AI, networking, and many more. Under the previous <a 
 href="https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/cluster-4-digital-industry-and-space_en#work-programme">Horizon 
 Europe Cluster 4 Work Programme</a>, spanning from 2023-2025, €27 
 million have been allocated to these projects.</p> 

<p>The FSFE has over the past years seen the wide array of 
Free Software projects funded by NGI, that support, in their mission, 
values that promote privacy, security, diversity in opinion and 
participation, as well as choice in the digital sphere, among others. 
These are values we view to support democratic participation online, 
and to enable users to better control their digital technology. NGI 
funding support was also crucial for the FSFE <a href="http://reuse.software/">to develop better 
copyright and licensing practices</a> for software projects, making 
compliance easier for everyone.</p> 

<p>This cascade funding system is however 
not renewed in the current draft proposal for Horizon Europe 2025, 
which will have the unfortunate effect of depriving many Free Software 
projects (and other types of beneficial research and innovation 
projects) of vital funding. This has us worried about the future of 
many of these ongoing grassroots level Free Software (and other) 
projects.</p> 

<h3>Where did the funding go?</h3> 
<p><a href="https://www.ngi.eu/news/2024/07/11/ngi-impact-study/">An impact 
study</a> finds that NGI projects have been immensely positive in 
providing funding and 
technical support for a diverse range of open projects, and in 
fostering an internet ecosystem that respects digital rights, promotes 
sustainability, and upholds EU legislation and values. Indeed, in 
practical terms, the study also notes that from the over 1,000 projects 
that received funding, 57% offer “viable alternatives to existing 
market solutions”, and 74% continue to operate post-funding.</p> 

<p>Given 
these positives achieved by the NGI initiative at large, it is 
disappointing and baffling to see the decision to discontinue funding 
for it. Without the Horizon Europe 2025 umbrella, NGI is now left 
without alternative funding, which will harm the Free Software 
ecosystem and therefore, EU innovation. The reasons for this shift in 
budget away from funding Free Software and the NGI initiative seems to 
be an allocation of more funds for AI, leaving internet infrastructure 
by the wayside. Meanwhile, <a 
href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/17/foss_funding_vanishes_from_eus">the 
EC has thus far declined to comment</a> to 
share its official reasoning for striking this funding from its budget.</p>

<h3>The future of an open Internet needs public funding</h3> 

<p>Funding is an important component in nurturing new Free Software 
technologies, and often makes the difference for whether a Free 
Software project is able to survive, succeed, or fall into abandonware.  
This is a particular problem because large parts of our infrastructure 
are based on these projects, as they guarantee the necessary 
independence and resilience. Cancelling funding means curtailing our 
own autonomy. This debate once again demonstrates a fundamental 
problem: We need sustainable, secure, and dedicated funding for NGI and 
Free Software solutions that help Europe to control its technology.</p> 

<p>With the EU attempting to create fairer and more competitive markets 
with the <a href="/activities/dma/dma.html">Digital Markets Act</a>, 
boosting alternative business models that 
challenge large, monopolistic, and consolidated digital platforms (also 
known as “gatekeepers”) is essential. <a href="/news/2024/news-20240627-01.html">Free Software is key for 
achieving such ambitious objectives</a>. Public money is therefore more 
important than ever to support Free Software alternatives in internet 
infrastructure. It is impossible to achieve <a 
href="https://deviceneutrality.org/">Device Neutrality</a>, and a 
free and open internet without the commitment of the public sector to 
maintain a vigorous and sustainable ecosystem of viable and real-life 
tested software alternatives that can disentrench gatekeepers.</p>

<p>We therefore call for these funds to be made available again immediately 
and for funding to be secured in the medium to long term. This is the 
only way to successfully drive the digitalisation of Europe forward.</p>

<h3>What you can do to help</h3>

<p>The budget decision is not yet official - so there is still a chance 
to allocate funds for NGI. It is therefore very important to <a 
href="https://commissioners.ec.europa.eu/ursula-von-der-leyen_de#paragraph_343">contact 
Ursula von der Leyen (President EU Commission)</a>, <a 
href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/write-us">DG Connect</a>, to ask them to make the funds 
available. </p>

<p>Pressure is also needed from member states. <a 
href="https://www.ideal-ist.eu/representatives">Contact your National 
Contact Point (NCP)</a> and persuade them to also advocate for the NGI 
funds to be made available.</p>
