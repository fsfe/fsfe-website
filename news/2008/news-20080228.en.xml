	  <title>FSFE calls on Microsoft to release interoperability information without restrictions</title>
    <body>
The European Commission has fined Microsoft 899 million Euro for 
anti-competitive behaviour by restricting access to interoperability 
information.  "Microsoft is the last company that actively promotes the use of
software patents to restrict interoperability. This kind of behaviour
has no place in an Internet society where all components should connect
seamlessly regardless of their origin," says Georg Greve, president of
the Free Software Foundation Europe.
