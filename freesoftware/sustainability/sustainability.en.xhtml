    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

    <p><strong>
     		  International development cooperation is increasingly digitised. Free Software thus is becoming an indispensable fundamental technology that guarantees legally compliant international cooperation and reuse, a technology that enables global scaling with simultaneous local adaptability. In order to tap the full potential of digital development cooperation, the FSFE demands that all software development (co-)financed by taxpayers' money be published as Free Software.

	<p>Free Software (also known as Open Source Software) is any software that grants any user the four freedoms to use, study, share and improve the software<a class="fn" href="#fn1">1</a>. These <em>“four freedoms”</em> are given by a software licence<a class="fn" href="#fn2">2</a>. Software licences define the conditions under which a programme can be used and reused. For it to be Free Software, the licence text must contain at least the full exertions of the aforementioned four freedoms without limitations. Read more about the understanding of <a href="/freesoftware/">What is Free Software</a> and how these four freedoms help support other fundamental rights like freedom of speech, freedom of press and privacy on the <a href="/">Free Software Foundation Europe’s webpages</a>.</p>

	<p>In contrast to Free Software however, sustainable software is still in need of a precise definition. This short study is intended to help with the understanding of sustainable software and sheds light on how the four freedoms of Free Software support the sustainability of and by software.</p>

	<p>The study is separated into four chapters. In chapter one (1), the most important aspects covering the preservation of software as a resource for modern societies are examined and sustainability of Software is outlined by using the United Nation’s definition of “sustainability”. In the second chapter (2) the previous findings are applied to discuss the sustainability of IT-infrastructures and Free Software ecosystems. In the third chapter (3) the impact Free Software can have on reducing our consumption of natural resources is examined, in particular the possibilities of Free Software to overcome the dilemma of software obsolescence and other means. In chapter four (4) concrete policy recommendations are given that help to foster a sustainable use of our IT infrastructure and in the final chapter five (5) we conclude with some suggestions for further readings and other initiatives in the field of digital sustainability. </p>

    <p>
		What is sustainability? What characterizes the sustainable consumption of a resource? And what specifically applies to a sustainable consumption of the resource software? In this chapter we elaborate how software has become a resource of modern societies (1.1) and how o preserve a contemporary software resource for the future (1.2). We briefly examine the influence of different license models (1.3) to further elaborate on of the potential of saving the last copy of a resource (1.4) and the sustainable use of a resource called brainpower (1.5)
	</p> 
     
     
	<h3 id="#software-as-a-resource-of-modern-societies">(1.1) Software as a resource of modern societies</h3>
	
    <p>
		Software has become an indispensable resource of modern societies. Whether industrial production, science, public administration, our media consumption or even our everyday communication: almost all areas are now permeated by software. A modern society without the use of software no longer seems conceivable. <strong>The existence of and access to software thus becomes a prerequisite for modern social organisation and functioning.</strong> But not only our social organization is based on software, so are our machines and our tools as well. <strong>Hardware needs software to function and vice versa.</strong> All machines and automated systems around us - whether at home, at work, or in public infrastructure - need software as an indispensable resource to do whatever they were designed to do. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Both dependencies – the one on the functioning of our machines and the one on the functioning of our social organisation - together make software indispensable for modern, networked societies.
    </p>
    
    
    <h3 id="about-the-sustainability-of-free-software">(1.2) About the sustainability of Free Software</h3>
    
    
    <p>
		The moment we recognize software as a fundamental and indispensable resource of modern societies, there also arises the realization and urgency to develop or, if necessary, consume this resource in the most sustainable way possible. After all, the stability and resilience of our current social organisation depends on this resource. But what actually characterizes the sustainable consumption of a resource? And what specifically applies to sustainable consumption of the resource software?
    </p>
    
	<blockquote>"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" </blockquote>
    
    <p>
		is an often quoted definition of sustainability from the famous UN-publication <em>"Our Common Future"</em><a class="fn" href="#fn3">3</a>. With regard to natural and limited resources, a form of renunciation can be derived from this definition: present generations should moderate their consumption and draw from limited resources only to the extent that there is still enough left for future generations. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
		Software, however, is not a limited resource; <strong>software cannot be consumed in such a way that it would ever exhaust the basic quantity of the resource.</strong> If we want to preserve today's software as a resource for future generations, it is actually not necessary to practice renunciation; contrary approaches might be helpful instead. 
    </p>
    
    <h4>"Resource Software"</h4>
    
    <p>
		The “resource software” is initially unlimited: software can be installed, copied and used as often as wished without ever reducing the quantity or quality of the resource. In fact, regarding the amount of the resource, the opposite applies: If we consider a certain software, e.g. the “operating system X”, as a resource and one installation of this operating system X as amount 1 of this resource, then the overall amount of the “resource operating system X” is increased with each subsequent installation. With the second installation of the operating system X we have the basic set 2 of this software, with the third installation the basic set 3 and so on. <strong>Each further installation, each copy and each use of a specific software increases the basic set of the resource instead of decimating it.</strong> That means that instead of practicing doing without, as is the case with finite resources, a possible strategy for preserving a contemporary software resource for the future would be to use it as widely as possible – meaning to install it as frequently as possible. This is because the higher the basic set of a resource, the lower the risk of losing or exhausting the resource - so the simple conclusion<a class="fn" href="#fn4">4</a>. This method however is in contradiction to certain certain aspects of the sustainable use of hardware and energy consumption (as elaborated in chapter 3), and so a more promising method to sustain software seems the complete archiving of the resource as discussed later in this chapter (1.5). </p>

	<p>
		Still, in this simple paradigm we already see a fundamental characteristic regarding the sustainability of Free Software: <strong>Free Software can be copied, shared and reused as often as desired.</strong> 
    </p>
    
    <p>
		In contrast, this is by no means possible with proprietary software because the originally unlimited resource software artificially runs short in proprietary business models with the use of technical measures and enforced by legal regulations and policies. Such technical measures are, for example, copy limitation measurements or other forms of digital restriction management<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a>, usually directly implemented by their authors.  These technical measures are often accompanied and enforced by legal measures and other governmental regulations, usually intended to strengthen 20ths centuries ideas of intellectual limitation rights<a class="fn" href="#fn6">6</a> such as copyright and patent law<a class="fn" href="#fn7">7</a>. 
    </p>
    
    <h4>"Intergenerational Equity"</h4>
    
    <p>
		While proprietary software artificially tightens the resources that have become fundamentally important for the organization of our societies and withholds them from the general public and future generations, Free Software opens up and removes any artificial restrictions  to these resources. <strong>Free Software licenses guarantee unrestricted access to the resource software not only for all people, but also unlimited in terms of space and time.</strong> Because of the resource’s availability in an infinite time span, we also speak of “Intergenerational equity” which aims at an equity between people who lived in the past, who live today and who will live in the future<a class="fn" href="#fn8">8</a>. It is precisely this intergenerational equity that has found its way into the core of the environmental sustainability debate since <em>“Our Common Future”</em> because – as already quoted – <em>“sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"</em>.

			<p>The release of software under a Free License<a class="fn" href="#fn5">5</a> enables a sustainable business and development model even after a solution has been handed over to the partner organizations, and offers unlocking the full potential of the digital resource: Since there are no license costs, no licensing restrictions or dependencies, Free Software can be reused and scaled without limitations - locally and globally. </p>

          <div>	
			<h3 id="independence-ownership">Independence and ownership</h3>
			
			<p>Via its license, Free Software offers the unrestricted possibility to further develop existing code and thus to adapt software. These adaptations can be done by users themselves or as a service undertaken by third parties. This allows, for example, local service providers to take over further development, maintenance and support of the software without restrictions. Free software allows maximum independence for service providers, service recipients, and partner organizations and can thus serve to build local IT expertise.</p>
