        The Society for Free Culture and Software is a Swedish non-profit
        organisation working for a society built around a free exchange of
        knowledge, ideas and culture. The society works inter-disciplinary and
        gathers knowledge at the conference FSCONS from several different
        groups, including Creative Commons, Free Software Foundation Europe,
        Wikimedia, FriBit and EFN.
