    <title>IPRED2</title>
    <description>
A second directive on the enforcement of &quot;intellectual property
rights&quot; has been proposed by the European Commission.  It aims to
criminalise all &quot;intentional, commercial-scale&quot;
infringements, and to allow rights-holders to take part
investigations.  FSFE will be pointing out to the EU institutions how
such laws encourage abuse of the legal system and have chilling
effects on law-abiding activities.
