	<h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act: Free Software is key! </h1>

	 <p> In the effort of adopting digital policies aligned with 
	 people's fundamental rights, the European Parliament is in the 
	 process of finding a position on the legal framework for the 
	 development and use of AI technologies. The FSFE is following this 
	 process so Free Software is included, innovation is fostered, 
	 control enhanced, and trust strengthened.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p> It is clear that digital technologies are advancing at a fast 
	 pace, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no exception. Technical 
	 improvements, the accumulation of large, detailed datasets and 
	 advancement in computer hardware have led to an AI revolution. 
	 However, these technologies are a double-edged sword: they have 
	 the potential to bring benefits to peoples' lives and to the 
	 economy, but also to lead to harmful discrimination and human 
	 rights violations. That is the reason we call attention to the 
	 important role that Free Software plays in this regard. There is a 
	 need for verifiable and trustworthy AI technologies, and Free 
	 Software is crucial to achieve this. Our demands in this regard 
	 are based on three pillars; innovation, control, and 
	 trustworthiness. </p>

	 <p>The collaborative ecosystem that Free Software enhances is key 
	 for the development of robust, accurate, and innovative AI 
	 solutions. Researchers, scientists, and developers alike can focus 
	 on creating new and better AI software if they can reproduce 
	 existing work. This reproducibility is doable thanks to the 
	 freedoms that Free Software offers (to use, to study, to improve, 
	 to share) and constitutes the heart of the scientific process: the 
	 creation of new knowledge from what already exists. Not to 
	 mention the advantages that this collaborative ecosystem can have 
	 in interoperability and cost savings.</p> 
	 
	 <blockquote><em> "We have already seen how global problems require 
	 global solutions. Thanks to Free Software, existing solutions in one 
	 country can be adopted in another one which saves duplication of work 
	 and time, while it enables a higher auditability and inspection of the 
	 source code"</em>, says Lina Ceballos, FSFE Policy Project 
	 Manager.</blockquote>
	 

	<h2 id="free-software-enhances-control-over-ai">Free Software enhances control over AI</h2>
	
	 <p>Understanding the factors that lead to predictions in AI 
	 technologies is important not only for transparency but also 
	 for further improvement. Free Software allows everyone to run and test 
	 the AI to understand how it works and to identify potential risks that 
	 can be fixed if the four freedoms are granted.  The right to improve 
	 the software is closely related to the avoidance of vendor lock-in. 
	 This means a boost in Europe's innovation capacity and 
	 competitiveness in this field. </p> 
	 
	  <blockquote><em> "From self-driving cars to predictive policing 
	  to healthcare - we need to stay in control of technology. The 
	  four freedoms of Free Software help enhancing the auditability on 
	  the AI, thus it allows us to have control over it"</em>, adds 
	  Alexander Sander, FSFE Policy Consultant.</blockquote>
	
	
	<h2 id="free-software-strengthens-trust-in-ai-technologies">Free Software strengthens trust on AI technologies</h2>
	
	 <p>AI predictions are subject to errors, which can sometimes even 
	 violate fundamental rights. By putting the AI under the 
	 oversight of everyone, these perils can be identified and fixed, 
	 thus having a positive impact on the trustworthiness of the AI. 
	 Trust will enhance the promotion and uptake of these technologies. 
	 The freedoms granted by Free Software lay the groundwork for an 
	 ecosystem in which acknowledging the potential of AI and control 
	 over it can converge. </p> 
	 
	 <blockquote>Lina Ceballos explains <em>"In decision-making processes 
	 led by AI, human oversight is highly critical. This auditability is 
	 viable if people have the right to use, study, share, and improve the 
	 software. In this regard, the openness that Free Software offers is 
	 crucial in the development of AI technologies and their compliance 
	 with fundamental rights obligations". </em></blockquote>
	
	<h2 id="fsfe-s-involvement-in-the-european-legislative-process-of-ai-technologies">FSFE's involvement in the European legislative process of AI Technologies</h2>
	
	<p>Already for five years, the FSFE has been demanding with its <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money? Public Code!</a> 
	initiative that publicly financed software must be made publicly 
	available under a Free Software licence. Publicly financed AI 
	technologies also fall under this scope. </p> 
	
	<p>We are requiring that public procurement, as well as in-house 
	development, encourage Free Software AI and digital solutions to be 
	used in the public but also private sector. Therefore, public 
	authorities using AI systems should make them publicly available. 
	These demands also apply to public research and public institutions 
	inventing, using, or procuring AI systems.</p> 
		
	<p>Thus, with the intention of bringing our demands into the 
	discussion in the European legislative process, we have prepared a 
	<a href="https://download.fsfe.org/campaigns/AIandFS/fsfe_AIandFreesoftware.pdf">dedicated 
	document for decision-makers, with more elaborated arguments on the 
	use of Free Software in AI technologies</a>, which highlights the 
	benefits that Free Software can offer to this crucial regulation. 
	</p>
 
	 <p>AI technologies are showing us already the potential that they have 
	 to become an important aspect of our daily lives. Therefore a 
	 well-thought-out AI legislation that acknowledges the advantages of 
	 Free Software is needed. This set of rules will define the framework 
	 in which AI technologies can be used and developed. Thereby Europe 
	 can become fit for the digital age without undermining our ability to 
	 control technology.</p>
