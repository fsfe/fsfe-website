    <h2>Free Software, Free Society</h2>

    <p id="introduction"> 

      Free in Free Software is referring to freedom, not price.  More
      precisely, it is about the four freedoms to <a
        href="/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html">use, study, share
      and improve</a> software.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) was founded in 2001 as
      the sister organisation of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in
      the USA to take care of all aspects of <a
        href="freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> in Europe.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll find in this section basic information on Free Software,
      its history, its current relevance for our society, our economy
      and our educational system, but also some information on the legal
      aspects of Free software and much more.
