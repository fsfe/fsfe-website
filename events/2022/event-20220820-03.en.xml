    <body>
      <p>The German Ministry of Environment opens its doors to citizens this weekend, organising talks, music shows, and workshops. Also it gives space to many organisations, and the FSFE will be present with an information booth. Free Software does not only help the users, but also the environment.</p>
      <p>On Saturday and Sunday from 10:00 to 18:00 you will find us at spot 26 in Potsdamer Platz. You can experiment in flashing phones and learn why Free Software is the most sustainable option. See you there!</p>
