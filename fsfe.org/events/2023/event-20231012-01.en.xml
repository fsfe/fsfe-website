        <title>Fellowship-Meeting of the FSFE Berlin in Berlin, Deutschland</title>

    <body>
      <p>For the coming meeting, we have invited Joseph from KDE, who will give a talk about the KDE Eco project.</p>
      <p>Software has a direct influence on energy and resource consumption. Since 2022, KDE has the goal of providing software which does this in a way that reduces software's environmental impact for us and future generations. In this talk he will present the work KDE Eco is doing to achieve that goal.</p>
      <p>Joseph P. De Veaugh-Geiss is the community manager of the KDE Eco project. The goal of KDE Eco is to strengthen sustainability as part of the development and adoption of Free Software.</p>
      <p>The event will start at 7 p.m. at "offline", Lichtenrader Str. 49, 12049 Berlin.</p>
