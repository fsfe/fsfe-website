    <title>FSFE joins 100+ organisations in call to restrict surveillance</title>
    <body>

      <p>
Privacy is a fundamental human right, and is central to maintaining
democratic societies. FSFE joins more than 100 other organisations in
demanding that states respect human rights, and bring their
surveillance apparatus under democratic control. We have signed the <a
href="https://en.necessaryandproportionate.org/text">International
Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications
Surveillance</a>. These principles are an important contribution to
the discussion about how to provide security in a free society. More
than one year in the making, they are now more relevant than ever.
