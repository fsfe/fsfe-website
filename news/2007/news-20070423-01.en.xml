    <title>European Parliament must prevent criminalisation of software vendors
    and users</title>
    <body>
The FSFE criticises the proposed "second Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement
Directive" (IPRED2) for sweeping criminalisation across various areas of law
and loosely described areas of activity, including for 'attempting, aiding or
abetting and inciting.' The proposed text criminalises these acts for
infringement of many dissimilar laws including copyright, trademark, and
patents.
