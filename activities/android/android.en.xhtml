          Android is a <a

          title="Android and Users' Freedom">mostly free</a> operating system
          developed mainly by Google. Unfortunately, the drivers for most
		  devices and most applications from the "market" are not
		  <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html" title="What is Free Software?">free (as in free speech, not free beer)</a>.
		  They frequently work against the interest of the users,
		  spy on them, and sometimes cannot even be removed.

        <p>
          This campaign can help you to <strong>regain control</strong>
          of your Android device and your data. We collect information about
          running an Android system as free as possible and try to coordinate
          the efforts in this area. 
        </p>

	  Do you want a mobile device that was really yours when you bought it?
	  Do you want a mobile device that does not spy on you and hand over your data to big corporations?
	  Then read on!

	  <h2 style="clear:both;" id="Why">Why Your Mobile Device Needs To Be Free</h2>

    <p>
	  Mobile devices are small computers that we carry around all the time.
	  They know our current location and contain private pictures. We use
	  them to communicate with our friends, our family and maybe our secret
	  love. They also provide access to the internet and have built-in
	  camera and microphone. Being such powerful tools, they can bring great
	  risks to privacy, but at the same time we can achieve great things
	  with them: it depends on who controls them.
    </p>
      
      <h3>Freedom and Control</h3>
      
      <p>
        Most mobile devices are not controlled by the users, but by the manufacturer
        and the operator. The software that runs on them is not Free Software.
        Even Android phones ship with non-free software and proprietary add-ons
        that often work against the full interest of the user. Software
        updates will only be made available as long as the manufacturer still has a
        commercial interest in your device. The applications (apps) available
        from the official market are commonly non-free. Nobody is
        allowed to study how they work and what they really do on your phone.
        Sometimes they just don't work exactly as you want, but oftentimes they
        even contain malicious features.
      </p>

      <p>
        Running exclusively Free Software on your device puts you in full control.
        Even though you may not have the skills to directly exercise all of your freedom,
        you will benefit from a vibrant community that can do it together.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      
      <p>
        Our mobile devices contain more personal information than most private
        diaries. But proprietary systems, even most Android phones, are designed
        to hand over this data to companies like Google or Apple. Most
        users do not have full control over the personal data on their device.
        Convenient solutions for synchronisation and data backup
        trick more and more people into storing all their data on centralised
		servers run by some profit-driven corporation. These are usually based in the US
		and are required to hand your data over to the US government on mere request.
        Whoever has personal information about us is able to manipulate us.
        Therefore, non-free devices are a threat to democracy and to our society.
      </p>
      
      <p> 
        Privacy is one of the most important reasons to support Free Software.
        Proprietary add-ons like <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_IQ">Carrier IQ</a> spy on
        smartphone users without their knowledge. Many apps from the market
        contain malicious features. They read your private data, such as 
		<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/feb/15/apple-iphone-address-book-privacy"
		title="Apple faces US inquiry over iPhone address book privacy">your address book,</a>
        and "phone home", or they use
        <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/mobile/android.html#overview">Google Analytics</a>
        to send data to Google. These are just a few examples out of many that have been
        discovered so far. The lack of freedom impedes independent inspection
        and secret spy features only become known by accident.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most smartphones require you to connect and identify yourself to a
        centralised server before you can use them properly. Users have to trust
        the server without knowing what information is stored and how it is
        processed or related to other data. A phone running only Free Software
        does not require you to provide data to an untrustworthy company or
        pressure you to do so – at least this is very unlikely, as the
        software's actions would be obvious and the community would be able to
        develop an alternative version. The convenience of "value-added"
        services that are often coupled with such connections can be provided
        using Free Software as well. This keeps you in control of your personal
        data. Your diary remains in your possession. You can have your cake and
        eat it too.
      </p>
      

	  <h2>Other Related Initiatives</h2>

	  <p>
	    Even though this campaign is about Android, there are other
		initiatives that make it possible to use small mobile computers with
		(mostly) Free Software. Due to the driver situation of mobile
		hardware, none of these initiatives really can run such machines in
		freedom. Non-free drivers and firmware are needed for many peripherals
		to work.
