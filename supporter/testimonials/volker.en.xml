         I have always been fascinated by free software. I'm supporting free 
         software projects in my spare time. My education as well as my work 
         would not be possible without free software. The fellow group in Berlin 
         showed me how to contribute to free software in a non-technical way. It 
         was and still is great fun to work with them in a cogenial atmosphere. 
         As I'm involed in the group now, I think it is time to join the FSFE 
         officially and to support them financially.
