    <title>Berlin Fellowship Meeting with the topic "Earning money with Free Software - (how) is that possible?" in Berlin, Germany</title>
   <body>
     <p>
    On Thursday, February 13, there will be the next Berlin Fellowshipmeeting, as usual in the e-lok (near Ostkreuz). This time, Paul and Richard will tell us about diverse possibilities of earning money with Free Sofware. Richard can give us theoretical background and Paul will share his own experience as a Free Software web developer. 

    As usual, the Fellowship meeting is a good possibility to meet other Fellows as well as other Free Software enthusiasts. You can get good food and best drinks at e-lok for a reasonable price and good mood for no cost. Official start is at 19:30.
