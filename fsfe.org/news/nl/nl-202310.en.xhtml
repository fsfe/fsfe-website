<h1>GNU turns 40 +++ Router Freedom, Fediverse &amp; Ada</h1>

<p>October starts after celebrating the 40th anniversary of the GNU 
project, that marked the beginning of our Free Software movement. The 
new political season has started, both at the EU and the national 
levels. Thanks for contributing to make our What is Free Software video 
available in more languagesâ€¦ and we had the first Ada reading in 
Italian!

<h3 id="#Happy-40th-Anniversary-of-Software-Freedom!">Happy 40th Anniversary of Software Freedom!</h3>

<p>For four decades <a href="/news/2023/news-2020926-01.html">the Free 
Software community has been working to empower users to control 
technology</a> and to help our society understand how Free Software 
contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination.</p>

<p>On 27 September, the Free Software community celebrated the fortieth 
anniversary of the announcement of the GNU Project with a hacker 
gathering in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland, which brought together many of 
our movement's key players of the past decades.</p>
         
<h3 id="Router-Freedom-German-telcos-want-to-exclude-fiber">Router Freedom: German telcos want to exclude fiber</h3>
 
<p>German network operators have requested the national regulator 
Bundesnetzagentur to start procedures to exclude Router Freedom from 
fiber networks. In a consultation, <a href="/news/2023/news-20230915-01.html">the FSFE picks apart all the 
telcosâ€™ arguments and calls on the regulator to respect consumer 
rights</a>.</p>

<h3 id="#Sovereign-workspace-openDesk-German-Ministry-of-the-Interior-provides-answers">Sovereign workspace openDesk: German Ministry of the Interior provides answers</h3> 
<p>The German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI) and the public IT 
service provider Dataport are working on administrative workspaces to 
enable digital sovereignty. But are both products Free Software? How are 
they related? <a href="/news/2023/news-20230920-01.html">We asked the BMI and publish the answers</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="EU-Digital-sovereignty-&amp;-Interoperability-What-about-the-role-of-Free-Software">EU: Digital sovereignty &amp; Interoperability. What about the role of Free Software?</h3> 

<p>Speaking about Digital Public Infrastructures at the G20 Summit, EU 
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pointed out that "the trick is 
to build public digital infrastructure that is interoperable, open to 
all, and trusted". <a href="/news/2023/news-20230920-02.html">What 
exactly does this mean? What is required to achieve such an accessible 
digital infrastructure that can help foster innovation and allow 
cooperation on a global scale? What role does Free Software play in this 
ambition?</a></p>

<h3 id="Fediverse-Symposium-&amp;-FediGov">Fediverse Symposium &amp; FediGov</h3> 

<p>On 22 September, more than 70 Fediverse experts, activists, 
representatives of educational and public institutions, and individuals 
attended our Fediverse Symposium to discuss decentralised social 
networks and the future of the internet.</p>
	
<p>The Fediverse Symposium was hosted by FSFE together with the Centre for Civic Education of the 
	State of North Rhine-Westphalia (LpB NRW) and the Adult Education 
	Centre Cologne (VHS KÃ¶ln). We will publish the recording of the event 
	soon. In the meantime, check out our <a href="https://fedigov.eu">FediGov 
	campaign</a> and follow us on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@fsfe">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://media.fsfe.org">PeerTube</a>!</p>
	
<p>Moreover, we have great news to share about our FediGov campaign! The Swiss Federal Chancellery has 
	opened a Mastodon instance as a pilot project, which you can follow at 
	@BK_KOMM@social.admin.ch. <a href="https://gnulinux.ch/die-fedigov-initiative-zeigt-erfolg">Read 
	more about it (in German)</a>.</p>
	
<p><italic>An important impulse for a free internet at the right time, the 
	#fediversefachtag at the VHS Forum in Cologne. Many thanks for the great 
	commitment of the organisers! This is a wonderful impulse for us in 
	#mediaeducation. â€“ 	@thowelsch@bonn.social</italic></p>

 
<h3 id="Software-Freedom-Day-Ada-goes-to-Italy-ice-cream-and-inclusiveness-included!">Software Freedom Day: Ada goes to Italy - ice cream and inclusiveness included!</h3> 
<p>We celebrated Software Freedom Day in Italy with the <a href="/news/2023/news-20230907-01.html">first reading of the story of Ada 
in Italian</a>. The reading, co-organised with the Bergamo Linux User 
Group, took place in Nembro. After that, there was a workshop for the 
children, and everyone enjoyed homemade ice cream thanks to one of our 
volunteers!</p>

<p>Have you realized that one of the characters in the 
book has a 3D leg? (I am sure you are currently looking for it - I did 
too ðŸ˜‰-). <a href="https://k7r.eu/importance-of-more-inclusive-illustrations">Some 
kids at an impairment hospital in the Middle East noticed 
it and were really happy about it</a>. Another example of how 
inclusiveness is important in techâ€¦ and in illustrations.</p>

<p>Our local group in Berlin also celebrated Software Freedom Day with a 
meeting. How did it go? <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/tobiasd/2023/09/17/software-freedom-day-2023-in-berli">Read 
about it (in 
German)</a>.</p>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is committed to empower users 
to control technology to digital civil rights, transparency and control 
over technology. It does this by promoting Free Software (also known as 
Open Source Software). In addition, Free Software promotes innovation 
and prevents vendor lock-in. <a href="/news/2023/news-20230906-01.html">Digital sovereignty is only 
possible with 
Free Software</a>.</p>

<h3 id="What-is-Free-Software-video-Thanks-for-a-successful-campaign">What is #FreeSoftware video - Thanks for a successful campaign!</h3> 
 <p>Thanks!! Your support for this initiative helped us to be able to 
 translate this video into more languages. Thanks to your contribution 
 we have the video currently in Albanian, Danish, Dutch, English, 
 French, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and 
 Swedish. <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/p/9gYSyoEYggsqBExLWjRejL">You can find all of them here</a>.</p>
 
<p>Our campaign has just ended but if you still want to contribute to have the video 
 translated into even more languages, you can still <a href="/donate?mtm_campaign=video">support us with a 
 contribution</a>. </p>

       </figure>

<p>Ada Lovelace Day is an international celebration of the 
achievements of women in STEM, held every year on the second Tuesday of 
October. A perfect way to celebrate it is with an â€˜Ada &amp; Zangemannâ€™ 
reading! We will be having one  at a school in Berlin so if you want 
to celebrate it, take action and organise one (and let us know).</p>

<p><italic>"I really like 'Ada &amp; Zangemann'. At FrOSCon 2023 on short notice I got 
the chance to do a reading. I went for an interactive format with the 
audience helping to read the book. It was a wonderful collaborative 
experience. The slides are great and one for each picture in the book 
is a dead easy approach to understand. My daughter joined me on stage 
and she had a great time too! In case you are wondering if you should 
do a reading too: Grab the book, get the slides - it really is easy and 
a rewarding experience no less." Isabel Drost-Fromm, member of the 
Apache Software Foundation, co-founder and board member of the 
InnerSource Commons Foundation.</italic></p> 

<p>Plus, this day is a perfect occasion to 
get the book and give it to any girl you know to encourage her to 
study and work in STEM!</p> 

<h3 id="Save-the-date-SFScon">Save the date! SFScon</h3> 
<p>We are warming up for SFScon! The South Tyrol Free Software Conference in Bolzano will 
be this year on 10-11 November. We will be there with a booth and 
several talks so if you are planning to go, come and say hi!</p> 

<!--this paragraph will be used in case the deadline is 
extended-->
<p>The European SFS Award ceremony will take centre stage on the 
first day of the SFSCON conference. <a href="https://sfscon.it/eu-sfs-award-nomination/">Nominate the Free 
Software Contributor of 2023 for the European SFS Award!</a> Help us to 
find great 
Free Software contributors by telling us who should receive this award!</p> 

<p>Until SFScon we will have more events! For example, in October we 
are having the Award Ceremony for the second edition of YH4F and a booth at 
an additional Veganmania edition in Vienna as this year it is 
celebrating its 25th Anniversary. <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/franz.gratzer/">(Read how it went this 
summer there)</a>.Stay tuned at <a href="/events/events.html">fsfe.org/events</a>!</p>


<h3 id="Quote-of-the-Month">Quote of the Month</h3> 
<blockquote>
  <p><cite>â€œ40 years ago, a group of hackers came together to do what seemed 
	impossible -- write a fully free operating system that gave users 
	full control over their computers. They proved that it could be 
	done, by doing it. Everyone feeling hopelessness about the state of 
	modern computing -- mobile surveillance devices in our pockets, 
	black-box AI threatening the fabric of society, streaming and 
	publishing companies trying to claim all human culture and 
	knowledge as their own by virtue of their control over the digital 
	distribution platforms -- should look to the example of GNU's 
	origin to know that we *can* actually get out from under this, if 
	we come together in support of each other and do our best to reject 
	what's being forced on us.â€œ</cite> John Sullivan, Alliterative Advising 
	LLC, former Free Software Foundation Executive Director</p>
