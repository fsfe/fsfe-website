            I am a strong supporter of the ideas behind free software and a daily
            user of free software. I think a voice that explains why Free Software
            is good for society and what are the conditions under which the Free
            Software ecosystem can grow is vitally important. By joining FSF and
            FSFE, I wanted to say thanks to free software advocates and developers
            and help in maintaining political conditions that allow and favor free
            software development and use.
