    <title>Berlin Fellowship Meeting with the topic "The potential of Free Software in public administration" in Berlin, Germany</title>
   <body>
    On Thursday, April 10, there will be the next Berlin Fellowship meeting, as usual in the e-lok (near Ostkreuz). This time, Andreas Pittrich will tell us about "The potential of Free Software in public administration". Andreas will report his insights and experience he made inside the Free Software comission in the Bezirksamt Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. We are looking forward to hear the outcome and the steps taken towards political influence. 

    As usual, the Fellowship meeting is a good possibility to meet other Fellows as well as other Free Software enthusiasts. You can get good food and best drinks at e-lok for a reasonable price and good mood for no cost. Official start is at 19:30.
