              <h1 id="-a-place-for-public-code-fsfe-support-job-vacancy">"A place for public code" +++ FSFE support +++ Job vacancy</h1>

        <p>Read in our September newsletter about a new strong alliance formed by administrations, politics, business and civil society organisations asking for "A place for public code". Also read about our call to apply for FSFE support for your local project, our job vacancy, and about our other diverse community activities.</p>

		<h2 id="-a-place-for-public-code-">&quot;A place for public code&quot;</h2>

        <p>A special interest group composed by the FSFE and many other civil society organisations as well as major German municipalities like Munich and Frankfurt have published a <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/papers/20200910-Ein-Ort-fuer-oeffentlichen-Code.v1.pdf">working paper (DE)</a> as a first concept for a common code repository for the public sector. Under the slogan <a href="/news/2020/news-20200910-01.html">&quot;A place for public code&quot;</a>, the interest group now wants to pave the way for one portal through which the public administration in Germany can exchange and jointly develop Free Software in an adequate and legally compliant manner. </p>

        <p>With the slogan &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot;, the FSFE is campaigning since 2017 that publicly financed code developments shall be published under a Free Software license. Facilitating the exchange of this software is just as important as the publication. And while other countries in Europe lead the way with other approaches but similar initiatives - for example the <a href="/news/2018/news-20180601-01.html">Technology Transfer Centre</a> in Spain or <a href="/news/2020/news-20200609-01.html">Etalab</a> in France - in the biggest economy in Europe however &quot;a common place to exchange this software within public institutions is still missing in Germany.&quot; explains Alexander Sander, EU Policy Manager of FSFE.</p>
        
        <p>The initiative invites administrations, politicians and the Free Software community to participate in the discussion and to further develop the project.</p>

		<p>From international campaigns to local information booths, our successful spreading of software freedom is based on many shoulders from active members within our community. This is why ever since the FSFE e.V. has been keen on supporting initiatives and activities from local FSFE groups to single supporters. We happily support you with our expertise, our information material, our networks or even financially.</p>
		
		<p>To help formalize our support we will from now on <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2020/news-20200907-01.html">run a bi-monthly call for FSFE community projects</a>. Participating in the first edition is as simple as filling out <a href="https://fsfe.org/community/projects-call/projects-call.html">a short online-form</a> until 4 October 2020.</p>

			<p>The biggest financial impact the FSFE faces in these times of physical distancing is the cancellation of Free Software conferences, including our own events. To keep the software freedom movement solid and alive, please consider <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate?referrer=nl">donating a part of your conference budget to Free Software organisations, including the FSFE</a>.</p>
