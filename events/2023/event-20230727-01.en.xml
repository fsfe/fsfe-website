        <title>An evening about Free Software with the Berlin supporter group of the FSFE in Berlin, Germany</title>

    <body>
      <p>Software influences all areas of our lives. It is important that this technology helps us rather than limits us. Free software gives everyone the right to use, understand, distribute and improve programmes for any purpose. These freedoms strengthen other fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to privacy.</p>
      <p>At the Free Software Evening at Kieztreff Undine (Hagenstr. 57, 10365 Berlin (barrier-free access) directly at S/U station Lichtenberg), the Berlin group of the Free Software Foundation Europe wants to introduce itself and the work of FSFE, meet new people and network over a nice evening.</p>
      <p>Topics for the evening on Free Software</p>
      <ul>
		  <li>What is Free Software and why is it important for a self-determined use of technology?</li>
		  <li>What is the FSFE?</li>
		  <li>Who is the Berlin group</li>
      </ul>
