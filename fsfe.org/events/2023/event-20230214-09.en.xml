        <title>I â™¥ Free Software Day in Lisbon, Portugal</title>

    <body>
      <p>
        MiniDebConfs are local meetings organized by Debian project 
        members to achieve similar objectives to those of the DebConf, 
        but on a regional context. In this first MiniDebConf in 
        Portugal, we'll not only be focused on Debian, but in the Free 
        Software communities in general. As this year's "I Love 
        Free Software Day" coincides within the dates of the 
        MiniDebConf, we'll have a moment dedicated to show our love to 
        Free Software on the 14th.

  Marcos Marado is a member of ANSOL, the Portuguese sister 
  organization to FSFE, and in this 30 minutes presentation he plans to 
  tell you a little bit of what is ANSOL, how has it been celebrating 
  this date each year, and how can you, too, show your appreciation for 
  Free Software on this day. The event takes place at Tecnico Lisboa, 
  Lisbon, Portugal, Alameda Campus, Av. Rovisco Pais, 1049-001 Lisboa. 
  The room is VA2 - on the 1st floor. The event takes place from 14:00
