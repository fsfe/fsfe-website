	  Free Software is one of the defenders of our freedom in the
	  information society. We have to use and support Free Software whenever
	  possible in order to gain more power and control over the omnipresent
	  information processing. If power shall remain to the people, public
	  authorities in particular should not depend on software which source
	  code is secret. Democracy needs Free Software!
