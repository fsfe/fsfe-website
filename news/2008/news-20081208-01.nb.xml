<h1>FTF og GPL-Violations publiserer retningslinjer for rapportering og fiksing
av lisensbrudd</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">FSFEs Freedom Task Force (FTF) og GPL-Violations.org
publiserer idag retningslinjer for rapportering og fiksing av saker som
omhandler lisenskompatibilitet.  Retningslinjene er ment for å hjelpe brukere
og utviklere med behandlingen av rapporter om lisensbrudd.  De forklarer
hvordan man kan lage en rapport, hvilken informasjon det er hensiktsmessig å ta
med, og tilbyr gode råd for hvordan prosjekter eller bedrifter bør forholde seg
til rapporter om lisensbrudd.</p>

<p><a href="/projects/ftf/reporting-fixing-violations.html">The guide</a> is
released as part of the strategic partnership between the FTF and
GPL-Violations.org, who work together to improve licensing awareness and
compliance in Europe.  It is located on the new FTF website, <a
href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/ftf/">http://www.fsfeurope.org/ftf/</a>, along
with information on how projects and businesses can get help with understanding
Free Software licences.  Translations into several European languages will be
made available during coming weeks from the FTF website.</p>

som en del av det strategiske samarbeidet mellom FTF og GPL-Violations.org, hvis mål er å
styrke 


<p>"The best way to solve compliance issues is to prevent them happening in the first place", says Shane Coughlan, FTF Coordinator. "We work to support this by educating the community at large. When problems do occur, we want people to be able to share information and resolve them effectively."</p>
