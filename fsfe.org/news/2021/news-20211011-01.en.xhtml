<h1>Translators team: Reaching more people in their native language</h1>
  
<p>The FSFE's translators team has been working tirelessly throughout the
second year of Covid-19 to enable people all across Europe to read and learn
about Free Software in their native language. Since the beginning of 2021 we
have had over 230 new translations into 9 different languages, not counting the
English originals.</p>

<p>Since the founding of the organisation in 2001 the FSFE's translators team
has been an important part of the FSFE. The translations made by the
translators team have enabled people all across Europe to learn and read about
software freedom and the FSFE's mission to empower users to control technology.
Translations from English to another language enable people who are not fluent
in English to read, learn, and participate in Free Software. Without the help
of our translators team, this would not have been possible.</p> 

<p>For the last 20 years the FSFE's translators team has been working on
translating the FSFE's statements, news items, activities, campaigns, and
background information. The first translation for our website, which is today
no longer available on the website, was made in 2001 by translating the <a
href=
"https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/fsfe-website/commit/e761cc866c4a245d0ec3dc1323257aedaaf70ae5">
"Volunteers welcome" text to French</a>. Later the "Volunteers welcome" text
became <a
href="/contribute/">our contribute page</a>. In 2004, with the move from
gnu.org to our own infrastructure, the then translation coordinator, <a href=
"/news/2021/news-20210305-01.html">Reinhard Müller</a>, launched the first
general information page about the translators team and the translation
process. Since then a lot has happened.</p>

  <blockquote>Reinhard Müller: "Translating web pages and press releases for
  FSFE is not only an important contribution to increase the outreach of our
  message, it has also proven to be an excellent first step for getting
  involved in FSFE's work."</blockquote>

<h2>FSFE's translators team today</h2>

<p>Today we have over 280 members on the translators mailing list, helping us
in their spare time to translate for software freedom. We have 40 languages
represented on our web page, with almost 7,000 translations. Among them are 
large projects, like the nearly finalised translation of the <a
href="/activities/publiccode/brochure">"Public Money? Public Code!"
brochure</a> to Spanish and the on-going translation of it to Italian.</p>

  <blockquote>Alejandro Criado-Pérez, translations to Spanish: "It's especially
  important to propagate the FSFE message in as many languages as possible,
  because Free Software's freedoms and their implications are often unknown or
  misunderstood, causing the general public to undervalue their vital
  importance to our democracy, privacy, and sustainability." </blockquote>

<p>Not only have we increased our numbers in every direction (members,
languages and translations), we have also improved our translation process.  We
have an actively maintained <a href="https://webpreview.fsfe.org"> webpreview
tool</a> which allows translators as well as proofreaders to view the HTML
source code as an actual web page. And of course we have also kept working on
our style guide, wordlist, and the translators wiki. All of this is done with
the help of the translators team itself.</p>

<p>If you are interested in joining the FSFE's translators team you are very
welcome to subscribe to our <a
href="https://lists.fsfe.org/postorius/lists/translators.lists.fsfe.org">mailing list </a>
and have a look at our <a
href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Translators">wiki page</a>.</p>

  <blockquote>André Ockers, Deputy Coordinator Translations, Translations to
  Dutch: "I translate for Free Software because I support the Free Software
  movement and want to help spread our message of empowering people to control
  their technology to Dutch-speaking people. Dutch is also the policy language
  in the Netherlands and a policy language in Belgium, so translations might be
  helpful in enabling policy advocacy on that level."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Luca Bonissi, Deputy Translators Coordinator, Translations to
  Italian: "I love translating items about Free Software mainly because I love
  Free Software and I want that all Italian people could easily know the
  benefits of Free Software in their own language. As a side effect, since the
  translation process usually involves more than one person, I'm also learning
  more about English and Italian too! :-P "</blockquote>

  <blockquote>T.E. Kalayci, Translations to Turkish: "I like doing translation for
  FSF(E) because I want to spread the wise words of Free Software (which is
  very important to humanity and society in my opinion) to Turkish-speaking 
  people. I am hoping that more people will understand the words,
  embrace the ideas in it and take part in the community to provide benefit to
  all the people."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>Pablo González, Translations to Spanish: "I like translating into
  Spanish because Free Software is for everyone, including people that don't
  understand English. One of the barriers here for the adoption of Free
  Software is the language."</blockquote>
