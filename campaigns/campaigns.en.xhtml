      	  We endorse and support the Geneva Declaration, and invite its
      	  drafters, signatories, and the United Nations to start thinking
      	  now not only about what the role of WIPO should be, but rather
      	  what kind of organisation it should become in the future in
      	  order to manage our intellectual wealth.
