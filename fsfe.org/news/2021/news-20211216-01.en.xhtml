<h1>Lack of public code cost the city of Stockholm €100 million</h1>

<p>
 <i>Öppna skolplattformen</i> was developed out of the frustration of some parents 
 in Stockholm when they noticed some irregularities and security issues in the
 proprietary school platform provided by the city. The original app cost the 
 city one billion Swedish krona (around €100 million) and it turned out to be 
 badly flawed.

<p>
  Administrations are relying more and more on digital solutions to improve their
   workflows and to make daily processes easier. This was exactly the case of the 
   city of Stockholm and its original <i>Skolplattformen</i>. This platform was meant to 
   be used as a common digital platform for Stockholm's kindergartens and schools, 
   by giving parents information about their children's school directly to their 
   devices. However, the platform did not work as expected, and once some parents 
   took a closer look at the software, they found numerous flaws in the app.
</p>


<p>
This frustrating situation made them decide to reverse-engineer the platform's 
API to create a Free Software alternative - <a href="https://github.com/kolplattformen/skolplattformen">Öppna skolplattformen</a> - 
  that offers a simpler, faster, and more secure experience. Despite these efforts, 
  the city of Stockholm was neither happy nor willing to collaborate with the 
  team of <i>Öppna skolplattformen</i>, and instead decided to start a legal investigation 
  and fill out a police report against the developers of the app arguing misuse 
  of personal data.

<p>
  This is the story of a struggle of some parents trying to fix the problems 
  that pricey proprietary software brought, and a skeptical administration that 
  found itself trapped in a serious vendor lock-in. With Christian 
  Landberg - co-founder and developer of <i>Öppna skolplattformen</i> - and Alexander 
  Crawford - early supporter and strategic, policy and communication advisor of 
  <i>Öppna skolplattformen</i> - we talked in depth about the Open School Platform. 
  What drove them to release it under a Free Software license, its progress and 
  current situation, and what lies ahead for this platform, but also for the use 
  of public code in the public sector?

<h2>Public Money? Public Code!</h2>
<p>
 Over the last four years, the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) has been 
 advocating for more software freedom in the public sector in the framework of 
 the Public Money? Public Code! initiative. It requires that publicly financed 
 software developed for the public sector should be made publicly available under 
 Free Software licenses. The arguments for this demand are based on the benefits 
 that Free Software can foster, such as saving long-term costs, promotion and 
 support of the local economy, transparency, interoperability, and more.
