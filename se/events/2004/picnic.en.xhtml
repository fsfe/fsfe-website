      <p>
       On the 15th of May, the Free Software Foundation Europe invites
       you to a picnic in Slottsskogen in Gothenburg, Sweden. We will
       gather at Linnéplatsen at 18.30 and will then take a walk into
       Slottsskogen.
</p>
<p>
       Discussions on Free Software, copyright, patents and other closely
       related areas will be in the air during the evening. Key signing
       will also take place, so remember to bring your GPG fingerprint and
       ID.
</p>
<p>
       You should bring with you what you wish to eat and drink. If you
       wish to take part of a joint purchase of food, you can contact
       Jonas Öberg <a href="mailto:oberg@fsfeurope.org">&lt;oberg@fsfeurope.org&gt;</a> who will organise this in return for a donation to the FSF Europe.

</p>
<p>
       If the weather takes a turn for the worse, we will have to gather
       someplace else. We will inform about that in this page before the
       actual picnic.
