    <title>FSFE Websprint</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        Over the week-end, the FSFE web team will meet to work on FSFE's website. A new design for the 
FSFE will be implemented, and a slew of new improvements will be applied. For this unique gathering, we need Developers (HTML, CSS, XSLT, Perl), good English speakers/writers and translators (of all languages).
For more details on the activities that will be undertaken, please consult the <a href="http://home.e-tjenesten.org/~ato/2010/fsfe/web-sprint/">schedule</a></p>

      <p>
        The Web sprint will take place in FSFE's Berlin Office, in the Linienstr. 141, 10115 Berlin. Contributors get free snacks and refreshments. If you want to spend some time with the web team but not distract their work, join us for dinner - departing from Linienstr. at 19.00 on Friday and Saturday, and 18.00 on Sunday.
