   <title>Social Event at German speaking team meeting, Essen, Germany</title>
   <body>
     On Saturday 14 June at 18:00 there will be a social event in the
     Linuxhotel in Essen. During the weekend the German speaking teams of FSFE
     will have an internal coordination meeting. On Saturday we invite all
     Fellows and Free Software activists to meet us at the Linuxhotel, discuss
     Free Software issues with us, and hopefully enjoy the good weather with a
     BBQ. Please let us know if you plan to come and if you can also bring some
     snacks, so we can keep that in mind when we buy food.
