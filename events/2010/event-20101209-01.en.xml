   <body>
  <p> This month again, the Berlin Fellowship meeting will be in the Newthinking Store, in the <a href="http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=Tucholskystr.+48">Tucholskystr. 48, 10117 Berlin</a>.
   We'll be there from 19:30. Ali G端nd端z will make a presentation there on "<a href="http://aligunduz.org/blog/free_gsm_talk_next_week.html">Free Software GSM"</a>. The talk will be aimed at those without any prior knowledge of GSM
protocols. "You have gotten used to the idea of Android and Meego? Let's see what
you'll think about the possibility of Free Software handling what your
cell phone is primarily made for" announces Ali G端nd端z.
As usual, this invitation is for everyone interested 
   in the FSFE or Free Software. We're looking forward to seeing 
   you there!</p>
