        <title>Public Money? Public Code! workshop in Vigo, Spain</title>

    <body>
      <p>The Public Money? Public Code! campaign has been supported by over 29.000 people and nearly 200 NGOs. Already five public entities, the Swedish JobTech Development, the German “Samtgemeinde Elbmarsch”, the Spanish parliament from Asturias “Junta General del Principado de Asturias”, the Spanish city of Benigànim, and the Spanish city of Barcelona have signed our open letter. We would like to have more administrative units supporting our cause. But to achieve this we need your help. In this workshop that will take place on Saturday 25th of June at 12:30 CEST at esLibre 2022 in Vigo - Spain, Lina Ceballos and Alexander Sander will explain how we convince local administrations or other institutions, decision-makers, and parties to use more Free Software in the future. The event is in Spanish, free of cost, but you need to register. Everyone who is interested is welcome to join.</p>
