          The <em>Web team </em> maintain and develop the FSFE's websites —
          ranging from <a href="/">fsfe.org</a> to project and campaign
          sites.  Webmasters are volunteers working to enhance the
          organization's face to the world, and to improve the technical
          solutions of our web efforts.

        <h2>Get to know us, get to know the website</h2>
        
        <p>
        If you want to get an idea of what work on FSFE's website consists
        of, the best way is to come have a chat with us. Some of the
        webmasters are regularly on freenode's #fsfe channel, where we
        will be happy to meet you and answer your questions!
        To check out who is working on the website, and with
        FSFE as a whole, visit <a href="/about/team.html">the FSFE's team page</a> and the specific <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Web">Web team page</a>.

        Your web coordinator, Paul Hänsch.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          The technologies and programs used to maintain the FSFE web page
          should already be familiar to many developers and authors and might be of
          interest to those that have not yet discovered them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Translators and occasional volunteers will most likely only get in touch
          with

            version control of web page sources
          </li>
        </ul>

          Volunteers interested in getting deeper into the maintenance should also
          be familiar with

            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a> – for the maintenance

          </li>
        </ul>


        <h2 id="Understanding">Understanding how the web pages are built</h2>

        <p>
          The web pages of <var>fsfe.org</var> are maintaned as a set of
          XML files.  The web server generates the HTML pages from these XML files
          automatically every ten minutes.  Consequently, all editing of the pages
          is done in the XML files, and the HTML is never edited directly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every page on fsfe.org is named
          <var><em>pagename</em>.<em>language</em>.html</var>
          (<em>language</em> being the two-letter <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO-639
          code</a> of the language, like "en" for English or "de" for German).
          The source files are named
          <var><em>pagename</em>.<em>language</em>.xhtml</var>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some pages have a dynamic part: apart from the fixed texts taken
          from the XHTML file, they include information from one or several
          XML files.  Whenever such a page is built, the build system takes
          the translated XML files where available, and falls back to the
          English version of those XML files that have not yet been
          translated.  This way, such pages can end up with parts of the
          text being translated and other parts still showing in English.
          Examples of such pages include the <a href="/">start page</a>, the
          <a href="/news/">news page</a>, and the <a href="/events/">events
          page</a>.
        </p>
