    <title>AGNULA: A GNU/Linux Audio distribution</title>
    <description>
      The AGNULA project aimed to create a fully functional, completely Free 
      Software GNU/Linux distribution for professional audio users. Run by key 
      players in the audio community, and funded by the European Commission, the 
      FSFE was a partner in the project, taking care of the legal issues, its 
      long-term aspects, and making sure that the interests of the Free Software 
      community were heard.
