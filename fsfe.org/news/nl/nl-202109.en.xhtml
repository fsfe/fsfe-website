<h1 id="demand-for-transparent-covpass-apps-in-eu-dutch-gain-router-freedom-70-80-">Demand for transparent CovPass apps in EU +++ Dutch gain Router Freedom</h1>

  <p>
	  In our August-September Newsletter, we celebrate the 
	  right of using a custom router in the Netherlands. We explain why 
	  every app that tackles the spread of Covid-19 has to be Free 
	  Software. We share the news of our vibrant community, following 
	  up what happened in the summertime and what lies ahead of us. 
  </p>

<h2 id="covpass-apps-should-be-available-to-all-thus-they-should-be-free-software">CovPass apps should be available to all; thus, they should be Free Software</h2>

  <p>
	  Apps that are necessary for everyone should be available to 
	  everyone, without having to install additional and proprietary 
	  software stores. This was not the case with the German CovPass 
	  app, which provides the EU digital COVID certificate for Corona 
	  vaccination on smartphones. It was only available on Apple, 
	  Huawai and Google app stores due to proprietary dependencies. 
	  Such a practice neglects those who consciously avoid proprietary 
	  software and choose to use Free Software. For them, the app was 
	  unavailable.

  <p>
	  Experts saved the day, and therefore we would like to thank <a 
	  href="https://gitlab.com/jugendhacker">@jugendhacker</a>, <a 
	  href="https://gitlab.com/mythsunwind">@mythsunwind</a>, <a 
	  href="https://gitlab.com/rugk">@rugk</a>, <a 
	  href="https://gitlab.com/tzugen">@tzugen</a>, Felix C. Stegerman, 
	  and Marcus Hoffmann. Together, they worked selflessly for weeks 
	  and developed the CovPass app for F-droid.  The experts also 
	  removed proprietary Google libraries which were not necessary for 
	  the app to function.
  </p>
  
  <p>	  
	  This additional work would not have been necessary if the CovPass 
	  developers – who are paid with public funds – had not included 
	  these unnecessary proprietary libraries from the beginning. 
	  Furthermore, the company developing CovPass was unsupportive 
	  towards external developers, which increased the difficulty for 
	  the volunteers to contribute improvements. Because of this, 
	  improvements which would have required little effort by the 
	  original developers turned out to be a difficult task for 
	  third-party experts. It is a typical problem that can be avoided 
	  by releasing as Free Software any software whose development is 
	  publicly funded.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	  The same process happened last year with the German Covid-tracing app: 
	  experts voluntarily <a 
	  href="/news/2020/news-20201208-01.html">took over</a> 
	  governments&#39; and administrations&#39; tasks to make this 
	  app available to everyone. In the case of Covid-related apps, <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210830-01.html">public bodies have 
	  failed</a> in Germany. &quot;We urge the government to quickly 
	  adapt its practices and make sure everyone can use such apps 
	  without any restrictions from the start&quot; says Matthias 
	  Kirschner, President of the FSFE. The silver lining in contrast 
	  is the example of Switzerland, where the official Covid 
	  certificate app was added to F-droid by the Federal Office of 
	  Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication (FOITT).

<h2 id="advocating-pays-off-dutch-internet-users-gain-router-freedom">Advocating pays off: Dutch Internet users gain Router Freedom</h2>

  <p>
	  Router Freedom is now a reality in the Netherlands. All Internet 
	  Service Providers (ISPs) must <a 
	  href="/news/2021/news-20210805-01.html">allow end-users</a> to 
	  choose and use their own routers and modems within 6 months. 
	  Also, it was secured that consumers who set up an alternative 
	  router should still enjoy technical support by the ISPs. The 
	  Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets' (ACM) decision 
	  represents a victory for consumers in the Netherlands and a win 
	  for net neutrality in Europe.

  <p>
	  The new rules passed after a persistent effort of the FSFE to 
	  draw attention to the importance of Router Freedom. The FSFE 
	  contacted BEREC raising the Router Freedom demand for the first 
	  time three years ago, in 2018, resulting in establishing Router 
	  Freedom as a standard for European countries. In 2019, 
	  the FSFE contacted the Dutch national agency too, to enquire 
	  about the situation in the country. Since then, the <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/BNL">FSFE&#39;s Country 
	  Team Netherlands</a> pushed the issue through by organising 
	  seminars, talking to stakeholders, going to events, raising the 
	  issue on social media, and helping with the elaboration of 
	  technical and legal documents.
  </p>

  <p>
	  Now, it is the time to celebrate. ACM&#39;s decision is a major win for all end-users in the Netherlands!

<h2 id="upcoming-events-">Upcoming events:</h2>

  <p>
	  On Wednesday 15 September at 20:00 CEST, the <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/BNL">Dutch FSFE team</a> 
	  will have its monthly meeting. The Dutch team always welcomes new 
	  members. If you would like to take part in the meeting, please 
	  contact the FSFE Coordinator of the Netherlands, Nico Rikken. 
  </p>

  <p>
	  In September&#39;s monthly meeting, the <a 
	  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/Women">FSFE Women group</a> 
	  will discuss gender aspects of learning programming. Research 
	  papers will be briefly presented and discussed. We welcome new 
	  members who identify as females. The date is still to be arranged, 
	  so if you are interested in Free Software join our <a 
	  href="https://lists.fsfe.org/postorius/lists/fsfe-women.lists.fsfe.org">mailing 
	  list</a> and get to know us.

	  <p>
		  On July 30th, Max Mehl, Programme Manager of the FSFE, <a 
		  href="https://www.thelocal.de/20210730/germany-knew-its-disaster-warning-system-wasnt-good-enough-why-wasnt-it-improved-2/">gave 
		  an interview</a> in thelocal.de about the disaster warning 
		  system of Germany. The topic came to the spotlight after the 
		  floods in Germany, but the weaknesses of the warning system 
		  were a known issue already. Max argues in favour of 
		  warnings sent through cell broadcast  instead of apps, 
		  because they can reach everyone with a phone and target 
		  specific locations. There is also a publicly accessible <a 
		  href="https://www.newsday24.com/norway/germany-knew-its-disaster-warning-system-wasnt-good-enough-why-wasnt-it-improved/">reprint</a> 
		  available.

	  During the last weekend of August, the FSFE Austria participated 
	  in the annual Veganmania summer festival. Next to live music, 
	  street food, and DIY workshops, the Viennese FSFE volunteers team 
	  organised a <a 
	  href="https://www.veganmania.at/2021/insel.htm">booth</a> to 
	  explain the basics of Free Software to visitors. The Veganmania 
	  festival is visited by thousands of visitors with diverse 
	  backgrounds. The supporters noticed an increase in how many 
	  people were technically conscious compared to the previous 
	  years. Also, newcomers in the field of Free Software were 
	  interested to read our guides with technical tips to increase 
	  their computer security. Instructions on basic utilities such as 
	  email encryption and password managers gained a lot of attention.

  <p>
    The biggest financial impact the FSFE faces in these times of 
    physical distancing is the cancellation of Free Software 
    conferences, including our own events. To keep the software freedom 
    movement solid and alive, please consider  <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate?referrer=newsletter">donating a 
    part of your conference budget to Free Software organisations, 
    including the FSFE</a>.
