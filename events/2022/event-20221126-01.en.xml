      <p>Artificial intelligence has many applications in various fields such as finance, health, justice or law enforcement and thus can have a significant impact on our lives. Therefore, it must be fair and without discrimination. Vincent Lequertier gives a talk 'For an inclusive and ethical artificial intelligence'. This presentation will give tools to understand the notion of inclusiveness and ethics of artificial intelligence, through Free Software software and technology.</p>

      <p>The presentation is part of the event Campus du Libre (Free Software campus), and the FSFE will be there with a booth.
