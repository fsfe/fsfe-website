<p newsteaser="yes">On Wednesday 14th of February, many chose to acknowledge and celebrate the annual <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2019/news-20190214-01.html">"I love Free Software Day"</a>. It was THE day to express your love for Free Software and gratitude for your favourite pieces of Free Software. The Free Software Foundation Europe would like to say a huge THANK YOU to everyone who joined and contributed to making this day special for everyone involved.   <div style="max-width: 600px; width: 30%; clear: right;" class="captioned right">

<p>We counted hundreds of Tweets and Posts both on Twitter and the Fediverse, and we are happy to announce that participation has increased a lot compared to <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2018/news-20180308-01.en.html">previous years</a>
Some were inspired to come up with their own visuals, while others decided to use our balloons and posters to decorate and remind those in the offline world the importance of thanking on this day all those Free Software solutions that they use on a daily basis:</p>

             </footer></div>

<p>People from all over the world joined with their own blog posts, news items, photos and artworks showing and encouraging others to join using the hashtag #ilovefs. As a result, Twitter, the Fediverse and even Facebook were flooded with love messages by people tagging their favourite Free Software projects. Thanks to our former intern and current volunteer <a href="https://twitter.com/JayVii_de">Jan Weymeirsch</a> who wrote a scraper to collect and analyse the data, accurately following each #ilovefs post, we have exact numbers and visuals to support them:</p>

<p>Overall 667 distinct #ilovefs posts on Twitter and Fedeverse were counted, made by 530 individual accounts, mentioning at least 231 projects and developers. Posts on Twitter were coming from at least 230 different locations from all over the world in 16 different languages. There were many more "I love Free Software"; posts that did not use the hashtag #ilovefs. </p>

<p>The important takeaway from all these numbers is the feeling of community that it generates; that such a diverse group of people can share common values and attitudes towards software. It shows how much we all love sharing, using, studying, and improving software for a better digital and analogue world!</p>

<p>There were also projects and individuals from all over the world dedicating special blog entries or news items, and we would like to share some of them with you. We were especially impressed by a student from Nepal, who used the occasion to spread the word and explain this day and the Free Software concept to those who are still unfamiliar <a href="https://sigdelsanjog.com.np/i-love-free-software">https://sigdelsanjog.com.np/i-love-free-software</a> </p>
  
<p>The OpenProject went even further by expressing their affirmation for Free Software by integrating a #ilovefs banner into their platform:</p>

<p>As we strongly encourage companies to also get more active with spreading the #ilovefs word, Zalando hosted a special event dedicated to the "I love Free Software" Day, hosted at their premises in Berlin. There were some interesting discussions with speakers sharing their reasons for using, loving and developing Free and Open Source solutions. Videos from the gathering can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf9bd23pftk-oYkS22pcW_wKBKmSczse6">watched in their channel</a>.</p>

<h2 id="save-the-date-">Save the date!</h2>
<p>In case you missed your opportunity to thank your favourite project, mark February 14 as &quot;I Love Free Software Day&quot; in your calendar for next year. But remember, you can always and without a special occasion create and opportunity to express your gratitude and appreciation throughout the entire year. You do not need a special day, as there is simply no wrong time for that!</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone involved in and contributing to this day, as well as the countless developers, translators, community managers, artists and anyone involved in Free Software.</p>


<p>We hope that this year's "I love Free Software" Day has planted the seeds of Free Software passion in all of you, just like Sonja planted hers.</p>
