<h1>Upcycling of software +++ FSFE Translators +++ Router Freedom at risk in Latvia</h1>
  
  <p>
	  In our November Newsletter learn why device neutrality and 
	  upcycling of software are essential to make (re-)using our 
	  hardware more resource-efficient. Read about the key role 
	  translators play in the FSFE and about the loss of Router Freedom 
	  in Latvia. Watch a new video on Free Software core values, and 
	  follow our community events.

<h2>Free Software helps extending hardware lifespans</h2>
  
  <p>
	  In the European Union we currently see a strong desire to make 
	  digitisation more sustainable, with the European Commission 
	  aiming at making our product lifecycles more resource-efficient 
	  as well as making circular economy methods applicable. Technological 
	  devices should be designed in a way that they last for a longer 
	  period of time. The Circular Electronics Initiative recognises 
	  that a common issue is that manufacturers stop updating the 
	  software of a device and then the user of the device has to buy a 
	  new one. A solution that gains ground in the Circular Electronics 
	  Initiative is that manufacturers of smartphones and tablets 
	  should provide security updates for five years and function 
	  updates for three years free of charge.

  <p>
	  In an in-depth study, the FSFE <a href="/news/2021/news-20211015-01.html">explains</a> that 
	  publishing the source code after the end of support is a more 
	  effective way to extend the lifespan of devices than relying 
	  exclusively on the manufacturers' extended support. If 
	  manufacturers publish a device's underlying source code under 
	  a Free Software licence at the end of support, the software of 
	  the device can be modified. This way, the device can still be 
	  used and its hardware gets a second life. Reusing software can 
	  help steer the European digitisation from a market of linear 
	  hardware production towards circular electronics devices. We are 
	  asking for truly opening up the circular reuse of electronics by 
	  enabling an upcycling of software. For a critical, long-lasting, 
	  and sustainable change in the extension of our hardware usage 
	  lifetimes, however, products <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html#id-device-neutrality">need 
	  to be designed with device neutrality in mind from the 
	  beginning</a>.

<h2 id="the-key-role-of-translators">The key role of translators</h2>
  <p>
	  <a href="/news/2021/news-20211011-01.html">Translators 
	  empower people</a> to learn about Free Software in various 
	  languages. Since the founding of the organisation in 2001, the 
	  translators team has been an integral part of the FSFE. Today we 
	  have over 280 members on the translators mailing list, helping us 
	  in their spare time to translate for software freedom. We have 40 
	  languages represented on our web page, with almost 7,000 
	  translations.

  <p>
	  "I love translating items about Free Software mainly because 
	  I love Free Software and I want that all Italian people could 
	  easily know the  benefits of Free Software in their own language. 
	  As a side effect, since the translation process usually involves 
	  more than one person, I'm also learning more about English 
	  and Italian too!" says Luca Bonissi, Deputy Translators 
	  Coordinator.

<h2 id="regulation-in-latvia-takes-away-router-freedom">Regulation in Latvia takes away Router Freedom</h2>
  <p>
	  <a href="/news/2021/news-20211027-01.html">Latvia 
	  has created a risky precedent against end-users' rights</a> 
	  by allowing internet service providers (ISPs) to restrict the use 
	  of personal routers and modems based on "technological 
	  necessities". When the Latvian Regulatory Agency (SPRK) 
	  asked for public feedback about the regulation, the FSFE shared 
	  its concern and engaged with the regulator. In May 2021, we 
	  submitted a <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe%20latvia%20ntp%20consulation.pdf">consultation</a> 
	  explaining to the SPRK that its approach limits Router Freedom 
	  and would not comply with European laws. Unfortunately, the 
	  regulator decided to keep its position.
  </p>
 
  <p>
	  ISPs can now deny people the right to use a personal router or 
	  modem in Latvia, claiming technological issues. If they do so, 
	  they would have to justify on their respective websites why they 
	  are restricting Router Freedom. Even so, SPRK still withheld the 
	  ability to assess these claims by the ISPs, and they would have a 
	  final say on the claimed necessities. Beyond hampering consumer 
	  rights, the Latvian situation creates unnecessary friction for a 
	  functional and harmonised framework on the terminal equipment 
	  market, negatively affecting European router manufacturers and 
	  vendors.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	No other EU country has identified such technological necessities 
	so far. We encourage, therefore, Latvian consumers to report 
	ISPs' practices in our <a href="https://survey.fsfe.org/index.php/628449?lang=en">survey</a>, 
	so we can get data and bring this to the attention of BEREC and the 
	European Commission, and so defend end-user rights.

<h2 id="public-money-public-code-now-in-japanese">Public Money? Public Code! Now in Japanese</h2>

  <p>
	  Code paid for by the people should be available to the people! This 
	  demand is said in many languages, and now it is said in <a href="https://publiccode.eu/ja/">Japanese</a> too. After growing 
	  increasingly popular, the FSFE's initiative PMPC has had its 
	  website and video translated into Japanese as well. <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/oiUmbjjiQKudwpWouPXEy1">The 
	  video</a>  was done by the same team which created the 
	  aforementioned new video about the core values of software 
	  freedom.
  </p>

  <p>
	Now with the Japanese translations, the "Public Money? Public 
	Code!" video is available in 10 languages: Dutch, English, 
	French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and 
	Japanese.

	  Help us translate the new video about the core values of Free 
	  Software into more languages, just as we did with the Public 
	  Money? Public Code! video. The cost of a professional 
	  translation is ~850 EUR, including editing of the script, an 
	  external professional speaker, and potential studio costs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
	We want to offer our new video in many other languages to help 
	people understand why it is important for society that software 
	grants the freedoms to use, study, share, and improve it. This 
	demand concerns us all as technology users, regardless of the 
	language we speak. You can support our translation effort as well 
	as our other work for Free Software by <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate?">becoming a supporter</a>.
