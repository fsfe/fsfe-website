    <title>PDFReaders talk at the FISL 2012</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        Matthias Kirschner, FSFE coordinator for activities in Germany,
        will present the successful <a href="/activities/pdfreaders">PDFReaders</a>
        campaign started last Autumn. The concept –
        removing advertisings for non-free software from public sector
        organisations' websites – will be explained in detail, as well
        as the keys to succeed in a similar action.
      </p>
      <p>
        The talk will take place in "room 41-A fisl 1" on the 1st of
        July, at 16:00 in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
