Before we start with the podcast, we would like to say thank you to all of you who support

00:04.800 --> 00:11.760
the FSFE's work of money. Working for software freedom and producing podcasts costs money.

00:12.800 --> 00:19.040
Please consider supporting us with our nation and the FSFE.org slash donate and in the show notes.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.120
Let's get started. Welcome to the software freedom podcast. The podcast is brought to you by

00:39.120 --> 00:44.880
the Free Software Foundation Europe. We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.280
I'm Bonnie Mehring and today I'm here with my colleague Johanna NÃ¤der.

00:49.920 --> 00:56.800
Johanna's is the FSFE's German team coordinator and he's also the person responsible for

00:56.800 --> 01:02.640
the public money public code initiative and today we will talk about open washing.

01:02.640 --> 01:07.520
Johanna's does sounds a lot like green washing but first of all thank you so much for being here.

01:07.520 --> 01:11.520
Thank you so much for making the time. I'm really looking forward to our chat.

01:12.240 --> 01:19.360
Thanks for having me for you always a pleasure. So open washing, it sounds a lot like green

01:19.360 --> 01:26.080
washing but what is it? Yes indeed so I think this is one of the first thing that people think of

01:26.080 --> 01:31.360
when hearing the term open washing and not knowing about it so it's similar to sound similar to

01:31.360 --> 01:38.160
green washing so somehow it must be a misleading market behavior mislabeling your product or

01:38.160 --> 01:45.760
something like this to fulfill certain criteria but so if you want to have a look at what it exactly

01:45.760 --> 01:51.440
means in the field of Free Software. Yeah it's a bit different already and in the last spring so

01:51.440 --> 01:58.080
in 2024 as the FSFE we conducted a community survey so we reached out to our community to get a

01:58.080 --> 02:05.120
better overview of examples of opinions and strategies of open washers and this led to our

02:05.120 --> 02:12.000
definition that we came up with and this definition is open washing means distributing

02:12.000 --> 02:17.680
propriety software while creating the misleading impression that it is Free Software.

02:17.680 --> 02:23.120
So we have two criteria that must be fulfilled the one thing is the product distributed must be

02:23.120 --> 02:29.040
proprietary so the software is not or not completely Free Software and second criteria and

02:29.040 --> 02:33.520
criterion is that there must be some sort of misleading communication around this so the

02:33.520 --> 02:39.680
manufacturer somehow suggests in his communication that it is Free Software although that is not so

02:39.680 --> 02:45.760
it's a form of mislabeling and typically it's used to have some sort of market advantage for

02:45.760 --> 02:54.320
proprietary software products. Yeah that's so much about the definition I think maybe we should

02:54.320 --> 02:58.800
take one step back because I already said something about proprietary software and Free Software

02:58.800 --> 03:05.680
and a lot of our listeners will know what this means of course but I think it's especially important

03:05.680 --> 03:11.760
for this topic because it's a lot about terms it's a lot about definitions and a lot about confusing

03:11.760 --> 03:16.960
these definitions and terms so it's important for us to be very clear about against what free

03:16.960 --> 03:23.200
software is and what it is not so to just make clear how open washers work so if we talk about free

03:23.200 --> 03:30.480
software we mean software that yeah gives the users gives all users for basic freedoms for rights

03:31.440 --> 03:37.440
which are the rights to use to study to share and to change or to improve the software

03:38.240 --> 03:44.400
and these are granted by licenses they are lists of licenses and yeah if one of those

03:44.400 --> 03:49.520
freedoms is not granted to the users then it is not Free Software so all of those four freedoms

03:49.520 --> 03:56.400
must be there yeah I think this is exactly the point where open washers try to confuse terms

03:56.880 --> 04:05.840
yeah all right I do have some questions here yeah sure let me shoot them so thank you

04:05.840 --> 04:12.560
first of all for the distinction between Free Software and proprietary software my question now is

04:12.560 --> 04:19.920
you already mentioned that it could be a Free Software that is not fully free or that it could be

04:20.560 --> 04:29.120
like in part free would this then also count as a washing or is the second criteria the one about

04:29.120 --> 04:36.960
the communication around it does this also is the case if a Free Software product has some parts

04:36.960 --> 04:44.560
that are for example an extra function or something like that that would not be available would that be

04:44.560 --> 04:54.720
count as open washing I know what you mean yes this depends again so if we have those types of software

04:54.720 --> 05:01.120
that some people call open core or sometimes we have a community edition and there's an enterprise

05:01.120 --> 05:06.560
edition so the community edition is Free Software and the enterprise edition comes with additional

05:06.560 --> 05:13.280
add-ons which are proprietary this can be open washing not necessarily but washing can happen here

05:13.920 --> 05:21.120
if the public gets the impression that everything is Free Software so if you have a community

05:21.120 --> 05:26.320
edition and enterprise edition for example and the manufacturer gives the impression that

05:26.320 --> 05:32.160
everything is open source of Free Software but you need the enterprise edition in order to have

05:32.160 --> 05:36.800
those add-ons that you really need for your purpose and those are proprietary but you're not well

05:36.800 --> 05:44.560
informed about this and you cannot obtain the code even if you receive the yeah the software you

05:44.560 --> 05:49.840
don't get the code and you don't get the full freedoms that you need so in this case it would be

05:49.840 --> 05:55.920
open washing if this misleading communication is around that does it make this this part clearer

05:55.920 --> 06:03.520
already it does it does now I'm very curious about other strategies that are around open

06:03.520 --> 06:09.600
washing I can imagine that different companies or that different projects have different strategies

06:09.600 --> 06:16.400
and that there are a lot of strategies that exist in this kind of marketing space you know what I

06:16.400 --> 06:23.680
mean so can you elaborate a bit on them yes we it's also something that we asked the community

06:23.680 --> 06:30.080
in this community survey and yeah people that answered our survey and contributed there came up

06:30.080 --> 06:36.480
with several examples and also yeah informed us about strategies or by that we could collect those

06:36.480 --> 06:43.920
strategies and one thing that definitely happens a lot is bus wording or misleading names so companies

06:44.800 --> 06:50.080
have a lot the word open in their communication or free but mostly it's the word open that they have

06:50.080 --> 06:55.040
in their communication around the product that it's that is proprietary or even they have misleading

06:55.040 --> 07:02.160
names so a very prominent example here is open AI the company that property you are know of course

07:02.160 --> 07:08.640
that's behind chatty pt which is of course not open but it's already the name of the company so

07:08.720 --> 07:14.000
people who don't know about we software will have the feeling that wow this is very open so this

07:14.000 --> 07:21.360
kind of bus wording of misleading names is meant to confuse things so whenever you come about something

07:21.360 --> 07:28.080
that's only open then you can it's it's not you cannot be sure that it's open washing but you

07:28.080 --> 07:33.520
should maybe have a closer look if the code is really there if you really get the far freedoms so

07:33.600 --> 07:40.400
this would be one thing one other thing is misleading licensing or hidden license changes it's

07:40.400 --> 07:47.120
something that we've seen a lot during the last years that some manufacturers had a software that

07:47.120 --> 07:53.680
was released under Free Software license but then at some point they added something to the license

07:53.680 --> 07:59.280
and to the Free Software license and then it wasn't the Free Software license anymore because there

08:00.080 --> 08:06.320
additional condition like can only be used for private purposes and not for business purposes

08:06.320 --> 08:12.640
or something like that and the public wasn't really informed about this there was a license change

08:12.640 --> 08:18.560
and it wasn't really Free Software anymore so this is I think pretty pretty popular of course

08:19.760 --> 08:28.400
there are also companies that start from the beginning with a license that it's not a Free Software

08:28.400 --> 08:34.480
license but really sounds like one so and they also say it's Free Software it's open source

08:35.040 --> 08:39.600
and then you take a look at the well known software so Free Software license lists that are

08:41.280 --> 08:45.920
you can you can take a look at the Free Software Foundation or at the Debian project or at the

08:46.480 --> 08:52.880
open source initiative they have those lists of Free Software of acknowledged Free Software licenses

08:52.880 --> 08:58.080
and if this software license isn't there then it's probably not Free Software and it's not a free

08:58.080 --> 09:06.000
software license yes one other thing one other strategy might be having Free Software client software

09:06.960 --> 09:14.320
but depends on proprietary server so far instance if you have telegram it's a Free Software client

09:14.320 --> 09:20.480
but it depends on proprietary server and you can't really use it without the server one other

09:20.480 --> 09:26.960
strategy there there even more but maybe this is worth mentioning is manufacturers who try to

09:26.960 --> 09:34.160
secretly redefine open source they continue to do the open source bus wording and say we are

09:34.160 --> 09:39.280
very open source here's the source code the source code is available that source available

09:40.240 --> 09:44.960
and of course this is not not enough because if you have the source code it's not sufficient to make a

09:44.960 --> 09:50.720
software Free Software if you don't have the other rights if you can modify it if you can distribute it

09:51.280 --> 09:57.200
so source available source available software isn't the same as open source software and

09:58.240 --> 10:04.080
or Free Software and if companies try to give this impression they try to confuse the terms

10:04.640 --> 10:09.840
and this as I said a lot what's happening here so confusing the terms making people unsure

10:10.480 --> 10:16.160
giving people the wrong impression that it is Free Software and in the end it is not

10:16.880 --> 10:22.080
okay so that sounds like there are a lot of strategy around open washing to be honest like

10:22.080 --> 10:28.640
there's a lot of different approaches how to do this but is there also a clear cut where you say

10:28.640 --> 10:34.720
okay this is not open washing and this is not a Free Software project anymore because it was

10:34.720 --> 10:40.960
realized and this was communicated very clearly can you also state some things that you would say

10:41.040 --> 10:46.960
they are not open washing yes absolutely so you already mentioned it so if a proprietary software

10:46.960 --> 10:52.640
product is clearly labeled as proprietary so if they don't do this open bus wording around if they

10:52.640 --> 10:58.800
don't claim it to be Free Software or open source then it's also not open washing also if someone's

10:58.800 --> 11:03.920
forking a Free Software and releasing fork as proprietary but being very honest about this saying

11:04.160 --> 11:11.360
this is proprietary then it's not open washing and also if a company is taking the code made by

11:11.360 --> 11:18.320
others of a software product and selling it without giving back to the original producer this is not

11:18.320 --> 11:22.640
really open washing it doesn't have anything to do with it so I think we should be very precise

11:22.640 --> 11:27.920
in our communication around open washing while those examples may be problematic for us free

11:27.920 --> 11:33.520
software and we criticize them and we are not very happy that this kind of stuff happens let's

11:33.520 --> 11:38.480
still not call them open washing to remain very clear in our analysis let's always check those

11:38.480 --> 11:43.440
two criteria in the beginning it must be proprietary and there must be misleading communication

11:43.440 --> 11:49.040
suggesting that it is Free Software or open source software all right maybe there are also some

11:49.040 --> 11:56.000
borderline cases so is it already open washing to call a proprietary product open blabla open

11:56.000 --> 12:04.000
something so open AI or is it already open washing to call a software open or source available

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
without mentioning open source of Free Software I would say yes in my personal opinion it is

12:10.000 --> 12:16.160
because it confuses the public about what is really Free Software and this is what open washing

12:16.160 --> 12:23.600
is all about all right thank you very much Johannes for this introduction to open washing my last

12:23.600 --> 12:29.040
question in disregard of the introduction is the survey you have mentioned the survey in our

12:29.040 --> 12:35.840
few times and I would like to know is it available for the public is there can others look into it

12:35.840 --> 12:42.400
and how was the survey conducted and what stuck out for you the most in this in those answers what

12:42.400 --> 12:50.400
was was there something that really surprised you so first yes it's available we don't link it

12:50.400 --> 12:57.600
on our website because so we I usually have a QR code in my in my parks when I talk about this

12:57.600 --> 13:03.520
and we I think we can also add the link in the in the show notes so everyone who's listening here

13:03.520 --> 13:08.480
if you have something that you want to contribute there you can of course still do that so it's

13:08.480 --> 13:15.840
open and we receive your answers what struck me the most is that there it was so pretty much everyone

13:15.840 --> 13:23.040
who answered there agreed about what is open washing and so it seems to be pretty pretty clear

13:23.040 --> 13:28.080
in the end at least in the in the community at least in that part of the community that took part

13:28.080 --> 13:36.960
in our survey it seems to be pretty clear and everyone came up with with examples also and everyone

13:36.960 --> 13:44.160
was also very clear in the in stating that it is a huge problem for Free Software and it's a

13:44.160 --> 13:51.680
huge problem for the idea of public money public code so that if we if public administrations

13:51.680 --> 13:57.360
spend money on software then it should be also Free Software because it misleads the public about

13:57.360 --> 14:02.400
taxpayer funded software and somehow it also cements the vendor lock in and its hampers

14:03.360 --> 14:09.600
tax guarantees so everyone in this survey was very very much agreeing on this point that is

14:09.600 --> 14:13.920
that it is a big problem for public money public code for Free Software and for

14:14.640 --> 14:22.800
the idea of tax sovereignty through Free Software I'm very happy to add that link and I find

14:22.800 --> 14:29.360
it's very fascinating that this is something that everybody is aware of even if there has not been

14:29.360 --> 14:35.280
quite a clear communication around this before because I think you started this like in the last

14:35.280 --> 14:42.560
year and I find this really fascinating that it has been a topic of people before we started

14:42.560 --> 14:47.440
the communication around this you know what I mean it has been definitely so we are not the first

14:47.440 --> 14:52.560
ones that are talking about it and being honest of watching is not new and so it has been around

14:53.280 --> 14:59.200
since yeah basically since people started to sell Free Software or sell services around free

14:59.280 --> 15:06.640
software so it's really something that has been around for decades now and as a topic also it has

15:06.640 --> 15:13.120
been discussed for many years sometimes under other labels but open washing is pretty much the term

15:13.120 --> 15:22.800
that's being used today still I think it's growing I have a feeling and also many people from

15:22.800 --> 15:27.600
those from the survey had the feeling that it's growing issue because there's more interest now

15:27.600 --> 15:34.160
in Free Software especially from the public sector so we see debates about digital sovereignty

15:34.160 --> 15:40.240
or tech sovereignty across Europe and several member states also on the European level and many

15:40.240 --> 15:45.200
experts also we as the FSFE say that Free Software is a prerequisite for tech sovereignty

15:46.320 --> 15:51.920
yeah suddenly there's more public interest in Free Software to get closer to this idea of

15:51.920 --> 16:01.680
tech sovereignty and in this situation apparently also there's more money in the game so states and

16:01.680 --> 16:06.400
administrations start to spend more money for Free Software or also we want them to even

16:06.400 --> 16:13.200
spend more money for Free Software in the future and if there's more money then they're certainly

16:13.200 --> 16:19.920
parties around that want to get their piece of the cake and yeah there are different strategies to

16:19.920 --> 16:26.000
get there one is to really produce Free Software but if you don't want to do that for several reasons

16:26.000 --> 16:32.720
then you might come to the idea that it's good idea to do open washing but of course it is not so

16:35.680 --> 16:40.160
all right um Johannes you already mentioned quite a lot of the problems around

16:40.960 --> 16:47.520
open washing and especially also in regard to public administration but can you drive into them

16:47.520 --> 16:55.440
again for me and elaborate a bit more on them yeah sure so I already mentioned public money public

16:55.440 --> 17:02.800
code so that's our initiative our initiative we started some years ago to to make it clear that

17:02.800 --> 17:09.200
wherever administration spent money on on software public money on software then it should be

17:09.200 --> 17:15.280
Free Software it should be open source software so public code and yeah open washing

17:15.280 --> 17:21.840
misleads the public about taxpayer finance funded software and the idea of this public money

17:21.840 --> 17:27.600
public code is that the state public administrations are nowadays pretty much in a vendor lock-ins

17:27.600 --> 17:35.120
so they are dependent from vendors with a lot of market influence that use their product being

17:35.120 --> 17:41.200
proprietary to lock the administrations in and make it very very hard for them to to change

17:41.840 --> 17:48.800
to move to another software to another product and now the whole idea or a big part of the idea

17:48.800 --> 17:54.800
of public money public code is to use Free Software to break this vendor lock-in and to help

17:54.800 --> 18:00.240
administrations to break out of it to break out of this vendor lock-in and yeah we in the future

18:00.240 --> 18:06.960
hopefully at some point we'll have some thing like mandatory Free Software first policies

18:07.520 --> 18:13.280
or public money public code legislation that makes it mandatory for administrations

18:13.920 --> 18:22.000
if they procure software then it must be Free Software and then if companies in those tenders

18:22.000 --> 18:30.000
in those procurement process try to place their proprietary products secretly calling it open

18:30.000 --> 18:35.120
source calling it Free Software then this is really a problem because in the end we again have

18:35.120 --> 18:40.480
proprietary software we again have the vendor lock-in and for the administrations nothing really

18:40.480 --> 18:46.720
changes and this of course is a yeah it's a big problem also for the debate around tech sovereignty

18:46.720 --> 18:54.160
about digital sovereignty because what what is meant by this is in the end public administrations

18:54.160 --> 19:03.280
have the chance to control to modify to change their and to to to change it also to to being

19:03.280 --> 19:09.920
control of their digital infrastructure which is only possible with Free Software not with proprietary

19:09.920 --> 19:15.680
products even if they are made in Europe which is which is now a big discussion by European

19:16.400 --> 19:23.280
as an answer for as an answer to the dependencies that we have on software companies from the US

19:23.280 --> 19:28.720
from China from other countries so but by European is not the solution because in the end it will

19:28.800 --> 19:35.040
lead us again lead our administrations again into dependencies from from proprietary products from

19:35.040 --> 19:40.160
companies who sell proprietary products so Free Software is what we need there and open washing

19:40.160 --> 19:46.160
again it confuses a lot here we must somehow do something against it

19:48.080 --> 19:56.320
and how can we counter open washing is there other strategies or yeah how can we step up and

19:56.480 --> 20:02.960
promote or advocate more for a Free Software because this is what we do we want to have Free Software

20:04.000 --> 20:10.800
yeah of course let's maybe distinguish there what can public administrations do and what can we

20:10.800 --> 20:15.680
all do so public administrations and of course we want and we as the Free Software Foundation

20:15.680 --> 20:22.320
Europe want to help public administrations on on this way they should try of course to reduce

20:22.320 --> 20:27.600
the risk of open washing when awarding contracts and for this they need expertise

20:28.800 --> 20:35.680
they need reliable structures and institutions that know about this problem that somehow come up

20:35.680 --> 20:43.280
with knowledge and strategies how to reduce the risk of open washing and very important for

20:43.280 --> 20:50.640
procurement we think is a tendering criteria so procurement criteria that try to keep open

20:50.640 --> 20:56.400
brushes out of the game in the end always a good checkpoint good checkbox for public administrations

20:56.400 --> 21:02.960
is do we with this and that product maintain the ability to change at some later point or do we

21:02.960 --> 21:08.960
run into a new lock-in and also important is the willingness to learn so it's good to learn how

21:08.960 --> 21:16.080
we can avoid traps how we can avoid pitfalls and like open washing in this process and of course

21:16.080 --> 21:22.000
it's important also for public administrations because they are also in in some cases developing

21:22.000 --> 21:29.600
software to avoid their own open washing so also by this it's good to have license criteria which

21:29.600 --> 21:40.000
licenses to use they can use tools like our reuse tool which helps them to yeah also to

21:40.560 --> 21:48.720
to label and licensing of their software products it's good for them to do open development to code

21:48.720 --> 21:54.880
in the open to do that maybe on on the open code platform so the code sharing platform for public

21:54.880 --> 22:00.960
administrations in Germany or in other countries the respective open code platforms they should try

22:00.960 --> 22:08.560
to be compliant and get their products maybe included in Linux distributions they should aim at

22:08.560 --> 22:13.840
multi-stakeholder participation to make it less likely that there happens something like open

22:13.840 --> 22:20.880
washing or they run into vendor lock-ins and also yeah to build up expertise to not run into

22:20.880 --> 22:27.120
open washing situations so that's on the part of the public administrations what can we all do of

22:27.120 --> 22:32.000
course we all can if we if we are programming if we are coding we can try to and we should and

22:32.000 --> 22:38.800
definitely should try to avoid own open washing also I think is what we're working on is that we

22:38.800 --> 22:43.760
all should try to develop a deeper understanding of open washing of the strategies of red flags

22:44.640 --> 22:50.880
yeah that might be a hint to open washing and if we understand it better ourselves then it's

22:50.880 --> 22:56.720
important that we start to raise awareness for the topic by talking about it in the public so give

22:56.720 --> 23:03.120
talks about it talk to public administrations to decision makers to politicians to raise awareness

23:03.120 --> 23:12.640
and also we should monitor open washing so be very yeah yeah keep our eyes open to see what happens

23:13.520 --> 23:19.680
if it happens somewhere if we see it happen it's good to ask to educate to convince so go there

23:19.680 --> 23:24.160
talk to the people ask them why did they change your license why do you call it open if it's not

23:24.880 --> 23:31.440
in some cases this might really help so there's an interesting maybe you can also add this in the

23:31.440 --> 23:38.400
in the show notes there's a person who's running a repository and collecting open washing cases

23:38.400 --> 23:45.120
there the then brown also trying to he's also trying to contact people behind those open washing

23:45.120 --> 23:50.960
cases to convince them to stop this behavior and to go back to releasing it Free Software or at least

23:50.960 --> 23:55.280
saying clearly that it's proprietary so in some cases this also works this also helps

23:55.920 --> 24:00.640
but in many cases of course it will not and then it's really important that we so we as the

24:00.640 --> 24:06.240
FSFE also we as the Free Software community that we identify and that we criticize

24:06.240 --> 24:12.480
open washing cases that we speak up if this happens let's not remain silent I think this is very

24:12.480 --> 24:20.720
important to to not let it happen and to yeah to yeah have a public debate about this because it's

24:20.720 --> 24:28.320
really a problem if it happens and yeah keep us from reaching our goals in terms of having more

24:28.320 --> 24:33.440
Free Software in public administration of having public money public code and also it's a problem

24:33.440 --> 24:39.440
for ourselves if we cannot be sure that software that we ourselves want to use is free or not because

24:39.440 --> 24:46.720
it's really somehow confusing I would love to link this repo I think this sounds very interesting

24:46.720 --> 24:52.960
I find it very fascinating that Dan Brown is actually reaching out to the projects there

24:53.840 --> 24:59.920
do you have any experience in how it is when you reach out some of the projects or do we be

24:59.920 --> 25:04.480
do this as Free Software Foundation Europe and reach out to projects that are going in the

25:04.480 --> 25:12.960
direction of open washing and what is the reaction that you experience the most there yes actually

25:12.960 --> 25:19.200
we do that and we we have done it in the past for example yeah in a case that happened in Germany

25:19.200 --> 25:26.400
two years ago when data port data port is a public IT provider provider when data port offered

25:26.400 --> 25:34.480
digitally sovereign workspace for public administration so workspace a suit of tools for public

25:34.480 --> 25:41.440
administrations the so-called DE-Phoenix suite and it was of course funded with taxpayers money of

25:41.440 --> 25:48.000
course I promised two digital sovereignty to German public administrations and it was actually

25:48.000 --> 25:53.600
also based on Free Software components like Nextcloud, Jitsi and Colabora and they even called it

25:53.600 --> 26:00.000
open source but of course we found out yeah if you look for the code the code of the whole product

26:00.000 --> 26:05.440
wasn't released there were links to some yeah to some repos of the original components but you

26:05.440 --> 26:10.240
couldn't install the whole thing on your server or deploy it yourself and it was also not handed

26:10.400 --> 26:17.840
to eligible parties so we received the lock-in to the to the product but we never received the code

26:17.840 --> 26:23.600
when asking for it so data port is owned by several German federal states and apparently they

26:23.600 --> 26:28.000
wanted to make sure that they were the only ones to be able to deploy the software suite

26:28.000 --> 26:34.640
as the software suite to make the most money out of it and yeah so we asked them about the code

26:35.200 --> 26:40.880
we asked several times we didn't get it we criticized this internally towards them and they were

26:40.880 --> 26:50.480
apparently seeing that there is a problem but yeah saying that at some point at some later point

26:50.480 --> 26:54.960
it will be released and please have a look at those original repos that we are linking on our

26:54.960 --> 27:00.080
website but it wasn't the whole code so we at some point started to criticize this publicly and

27:00.160 --> 27:07.840
others also did and we followed up regularly as I said we tried to be in this watchdog role around

27:07.840 --> 27:13.520
this case and what happened at the same time is that the German center for digital sovereignty

27:13.520 --> 27:20.960
and so centers released a similar product product to DE-Phoenix and this was Free Software so at some

27:20.960 --> 27:26.160
point during the last two years data port must have realized that with this kind of critical

27:26.160 --> 27:32.480
publicity from our site and from others and also with the site of Free Software competition from

27:33.200 --> 27:40.800
centers their open washing strategy doesn't work so today they don't have DE-Phoenix they don't have

27:40.800 --> 27:46.400
this open washing suite on their portfolio anymore of course we would have preferred if they had

27:46.400 --> 27:52.160
decided to release the full code under Free Software license but still one case less of open

27:52.160 --> 27:59.680
washing for us this is a success so if we talk to organizations to companies to also to public

27:59.680 --> 28:05.600
administrations about this topic about potential on open washing we are glad if they pick up our

28:05.600 --> 28:10.720
arguments and if they try to to go in the direction of Free Software and public money public code

28:10.720 --> 28:16.880
rather than open washing if this doesn't work if it's not the case yeah they can be sure that at

28:16.880 --> 28:25.520
some point we will speak up about this and I think it's also important that yeah that we as a

28:25.520 --> 28:34.080
community that we do that you mentioned speaking up but I guess there's no central institute that

28:34.080 --> 28:39.760
others can contact and say oh there's an open washing case so what happens if somebody of our

28:39.760 --> 28:46.960
listeners would now encounter a product a Free Software product for example that would go in a

28:46.960 --> 28:53.120
direction of open washing or that would go in a direction of open core what could they do I mean

28:53.120 --> 29:00.480
there's also no legal option for them so do you have any advice yeah so as you said it's a

29:00.480 --> 29:05.600
it's a bad practice it's harmful towards Free Software and our communities but in most cases it's

29:05.600 --> 29:10.640
not a legal so the legal options are really limited you cannot just go there and say I'm going to

29:10.640 --> 29:16.560
sue you because you're doing open washing in most cases it's not possible and as you also said there

29:16.560 --> 29:22.480
is no such thing as a reporting center for open washing so as a consequence the whole debate around

29:22.480 --> 29:28.960
open washing is always a debate around public opinions around political views decision-making

29:28.960 --> 29:34.400
and also around best practices so what you all can do what we all can do is to have a deep

29:34.400 --> 29:40.160
understanding of the problem it's reasons the strategies the consequences and that to raise

29:40.160 --> 29:47.760
awareness to talk to people about open washing also like like I already said to can't give it

29:47.760 --> 29:53.280
to try to talk to potential or obvious open washes but it's very good if you find cases and you're

29:53.280 --> 29:57.680
not sure about how to deal with that and you really think it's important and also important for

29:57.680 --> 30:05.040
yeah it might help our public money public code you can always contact us and tell us about this

30:05.040 --> 30:11.200
so as I said this the survey in the in the show notes you can use this or you can also just write

30:11.200 --> 30:18.320
an email to contact at FSFE:.org and this will really help us we will in many cases not go there

30:18.320 --> 30:23.600
and convince them or not will be able to convince them that they stop this behavior stop this

30:23.600 --> 30:30.240
open washing behavior but we can use those examples for the debate we can use it for raising awareness

30:30.240 --> 30:36.400
around the topic and we give sometimes counsel to public administration to public administrations

30:36.400 --> 30:41.360
who want to go in the direction of public money public code so we can also tell them about those

30:41.360 --> 30:47.200
examples to help them better understand the situations and also to help them better understand

30:47.280 --> 30:55.680
where our potential players that go more in the direction of open washing thank you

30:57.040 --> 31:03.440
do I think I find this a very helpful advice let me maybe add one thing which you always can do to

31:03.440 --> 31:08.960
support our case against open washing become a supporter of the FSFE: so that's really easy just

31:08.960 --> 31:15.680
go to FSFE:.org slash donate also I think you will find the link in the in the show notes and yeah

31:15.760 --> 31:21.920
start supporting us with a regular donation every month this really helps us because our work is

31:21.920 --> 31:28.720
funded by donations mainly and yeah really depend on your donations so this would be really something

31:28.720 --> 31:33.200
where you can also contribute and if you want to become active it's also something that you can do

31:33.200 --> 31:39.840
check out our website there are described many ways how you can become active with the FSFE:

31:39.840 --> 31:45.360
but again donations are the easiest thing it's really easy just yeah maybe consider to help us

31:45.440 --> 31:52.000
that way which will also really help Free Software and public money public code thank you so much

31:52.000 --> 31:56.880
for being here thank you so much for your time thank you so much for elaborating on open washing

31:57.440 --> 32:03.200
and yet taking us on this journey there and letting us dive into this topic thank you so much

32:03.200 --> 32:09.600
Bonnie that's really pleasure to talk with you thanks all right dear listeners thank you so

32:09.600 --> 32:14.960
much for being with us thank you so much for listening to us this was the software freedom podcast

32:15.440 --> 32:22.160
if you liked this episode please recommend it to your friends and rate it stay tuned for more

32:22.160 --> 32:27.440
inspiring conversations that explore the importance of software freedom and its impact on our

32:27.440 --> 32:33.840
digital to lives this podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe

32:33.840 --> 32:40.880
there are a charity that works on promoting software freedom if you like our work please consider

32:41.520 --> 32:49.600
supporting us for the nation you find more information under FSFE:.org slash donate thanks bye bye

32:56.000 --> 33:03.040
hi i'm Daragh from the FSFE island next you will hear Bonnie and I talking about how and why I got

33:03.040 --> 33:08.720
involved the Free Software Foundation Europe and Free Software as a whole my first contact with

33:08.720 --> 33:14.560
the FSFE: was actually the software freedom podcast so thank you for that it's um I'd gotten

33:14.560 --> 33:19.520
into Linux for a while i'd been using open source because uh I was opening my computer every day

33:19.520 --> 33:24.000
and it felt like I had to personally fist fight Microsoft every morning and I was going insane

33:25.040 --> 33:29.600
so I started looking more into kind of the ethos around open source and I find the software freedom

33:29.600 --> 33:33.840
podcast and I really loved it I thought it was really interesting stuff with really great content

33:33.840 --> 33:40.240
really insightful talks so then I applied for an internship at the FSFE: because I noticed there was

33:40.240 --> 33:46.000
an opening and I happened to get it after a very entertaining interview I will say it was

33:46.000 --> 33:49.920
pretty funny at the time because uh I accidentally joined the wrong room and then there was some

33:49.920 --> 33:56.480
chasing around so do you know those scenes and cartoons with scooby-doo when they're all coming out

33:56.480 --> 34:01.520
of doorways and then someone's coming out of another doorway I was doing this for about 15 minutes

34:01.920 --> 34:06.480
uh I think at some point I might have ended up fun like a team skull with someone else somehow i

34:06.480 --> 34:11.760
don't even know what FSFE: doesn't use teams it was uh an entertaining disaster zone for 15 minutes

34:12.320 --> 34:18.000
but finally it went well enough I don't know and then i've got an internship so then I worked

34:18.000 --> 34:22.560
with the FSFE: as an intern and i've stayed on as a volunteer fixing some things around the place

34:23.120 --> 34:30.720
and uh I think that's about that that's a really really funny story I don't know

34:31.920 --> 34:39.760
yeah okay so you knew the FSFE: before but why what made you stay like what was the reason for

34:39.760 --> 34:46.160
you to say oh yeah I do this internship and then after this internship you stick around I stay

34:46.160 --> 34:52.240
around at the FSFE: and work with the FSFE: because I think the FSFE: does really incredible work with

34:52.240 --> 34:56.880
the governments of Europe in particular the European Union there's a lot of Free Software projects

34:56.880 --> 35:01.120
and they do their best writing great code and doing really great community work but to properly

35:01.200 --> 35:05.600
support them there needs to be organizations talking to government and talking to large organizations

35:05.600 --> 35:10.160
to make sure those people get the support they need and I think the FSFE: is one of the premier

35:10.160 --> 35:14.880
organizations on the planet are doing that right now so I'm happy to be a part of that really excellent

35:14.880 --> 35:22.000
work thank you and what would you say to a person that you wouldn't meet and that wants to join the

35:22.000 --> 35:29.680
FSFE: by they should join the FSFE: so support or volunteer I would say that people should work with

35:29.760 --> 35:34.960
and support the FSFE: because if you want to get up every morning and use tech devices and not

35:34.960 --> 35:39.120
feel like the entire time like you're fighting with someone who wants to steal all of your information

35:39.120 --> 35:44.720
sell it to someone and also make you buy like new shoes or something you should work with the

35:44.720 --> 36:03.760
FSFEe because otherwise that's what it feels like every day thank you
