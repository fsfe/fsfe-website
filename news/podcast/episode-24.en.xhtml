<p>Karen Sandler is the executive director of the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> and has a background in law and engineering. Our second guest for this  episode is the FSFE's Senior Policy Consultant, Alexander Sander. In his work, Alex focuses on policy topics, always raising the status of Free Software within Europe. Over the past year, he has met with many decision-makers in Europe such as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) or officials from the European Commission and Council, to talk about Free Software, for example in relation to the AI Act, the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), or the Product Liability Directive (PLD).</p>

<p>At the same time, across the ocean, the Software Freedom Conservancy has been working <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2023/dec/06/sfc-amicus-curiae-in-dmca-suit/">with a broad alliance</a> to advocate for the right to repair.</p>

<p>In short a lot has happened in the past year. Luckily, Alex and Karen are here to talk with our host Bonnie about the current situation and what we still need to do for software freedom. Learn more about the state of Free Software with Alex and Karen and find out how you can support software freedom.</p>

<p>This is the perfect episode for everybody who needs a quick summary of the past year. Let's start software freedom!</p>
