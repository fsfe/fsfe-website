      "A fun and insightful children's book that cleverly promotes digital citizenship and the value of sharing. . . . Whether read aloud by a parent or guardian or independently by a young reader, this book's engaging narrative and vibrant illustrations are sure to captivate children's imaginations while instilling important values that they can carry with them as they grow (and code)."
