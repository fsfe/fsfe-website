		<h2>I ♥ Free Software Day 2024: Forge the future of Free Software</h2>

		<p>“I Love Free Software Day” has been a long lasting tradition. On this day, we thank all the people behind Free Software projects or programs and let them know that their work does not go unnoticed. Let’s celebrate together all the wonderful people working for Free Software: you are invited to join “I Love Free Software Day” celebrations all across Europe. Connect with your <a href="/about/groups.html">local FSFE group</a> and organise a fun meetup.</p>

		<p>We are grateful to those who work and contribute to the Free Software universe: developers, designers, translators, advocates, donors, users, and more. There are a lot of different Free Software communities out there, with different values or different focuses in their work. But we all share our love for Free Software and value the freedom to use, study, share and improve software. Let's celebrate our appreciation for Free Software and the people behind it with a simple <q>Thank you!</q></p>

		<p>This year’s edition is themed “Forge the future with Free Software” because we want to focus on the critical value of new generations. We want to involve youngsters in the celebration, both by thanking young contributors, and by introducing the principles of Free Software to those who were not aware of it before. You can be part of this by joing the celebrations and organising a gathering in your local area.</p>

		<h2>Join the party</h2>
		
		<p>Do you want to celebrate with other Free Software enthusiasts? Soon, we will be announcing the gatherings happening all around Europe! Follow us on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@fsfe">social media</a> not to miss anything!</p>
