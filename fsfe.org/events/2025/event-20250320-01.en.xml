      <p>We are a group for women* who are interested in Free Software. Once a month, on the 20th, we meet to talk about Free Software and women* in the tech. Together we learn about Free Software
      and related topics that we care about and discuss recent developments.</p>
     <p>The group is women-centric and open to all women*, inter, trans and non-binary people. We meet on the 20th of March at 20:00 (CET)
