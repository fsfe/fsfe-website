      Nowadays we use social networks, laptops and mobile devices every day.
      And very frequently we lose the important social and political vision of
      Free Software in all of them. Thanks to FSFE, FSF and other similar
      organizations and many local groups, we maintain the torch of a different
      world where everyone can use and share a lot of programs and code, no
      matter the country you live in or how much money you can afford to spend
      on it.
