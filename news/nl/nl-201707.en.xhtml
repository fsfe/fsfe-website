	<h2>The FSFE now provides Git hosting for its supporters</h2>

		<p newsteaser="yes">Sharing one's knowledge and enhancing collaboration are core principles in the Free Software community. Therefore, the FSFE is happy to now provide its supporters and registered volunteers a platform to create and manage Git repositories with a comfortable web interface under <a href="https://git.fsfe.org">git.fsfe.org</a>.</p>


		
		<p>With git.fsfe.org, the FSFE allows its supporters to share and collaborate on a platform <a href="/news/2017/news-20170616-01.html">that fully respects their freedoms</a>. And while users are free to use this platform for their private purposes, we encourage every activist and local group of the FSFE to host code they are using for their FSFE activities, to share minutes or other documents of FSFE group meetings as well as any other publicly interesting information. This way, we would like to facilitate and stimulate collaboration, feedback and creativity inside our pan-European community. </p>

		<p>Official teams and working groups of the association of the FSFE will also strive to migrate as much code and relevant files as possible to this new platform. For example future website developments, promotion material, and helpful scripts for the organisation's day-to-day work. For Git beginners we explain the service in detail in the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/TechDocs/Git">FSFE wiki</a>. Advanced users are welcome to help extending guides for the most common Git workflows.</p>	
		
		<p>Find us and use, study, share and improve at <a href="https://git.fsfe.org">git.fsfe.org</a>.</p>
