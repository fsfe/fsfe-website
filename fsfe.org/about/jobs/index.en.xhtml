  <h2>About the FSFE</h2>

  <p>
    Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to control
    technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives and it
    is important that technology empowers rather than restricts us. Free
    Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt, and share
    software. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom
    of speech, press, and privacy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free Software
    contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination. It enhances
    users' rights by abolishing barriers to Free Software adoption, encourages
    people to use and develop Free Software, and provides resources to enable
    everyone to further promote Free Software in Europe.
  </p>

  <p>
    The FSFE operates in a lively environment of numerous volunteers from many
    countries and several full-time employees. We are involved in <a href="/activities/">many activities</a> in <a href="/about/ourwork.html">social,
    political, legal, and technical areas</a> that are driven by staff and
    volunteers.

  <h2>Our offer to you</h2>

          My eleven months as trainee and part of the FSFE's international team,
          have been full with new things to learn, great people to meet,
          challenges to overcome and opportunities to grasp. There was never a
          boring day. I was involved in high-level legal and policy work as well
          as community building and awareness-raising activities. I was in the
          core preparation team of short and long-term campaigns.
