    <h1>Petition for advertisement-free governmental websites</h1>
<!-- decide on the title : with "advertisement-free" we reject the possibility of having alternative advertising for free PDFreaders, with "fair government advertising" we have a very tricky formulation, with "to stop governments endorsing the PDFreader monopoly" it sounds very agressive...-->

    <p>Each time that they redirect you to a downloading interface for a 
non-free PDFreader while you have to read a PDF file, government websites 
are advertising for proprietary software. Apart from being against FSFE's 
philosophy to advocate Free Software, we believe that governmental website 
are to be neutral towards private products.</p>

<p>In redirecting you to a downloading interface, they commit two major mistakes :</p>

<ul><li>Firstly, they tell you that to read the pdf document, you <strong>need</strong> 
to download the software the proprietary software that they propose.</li></ul>

<p>This is not true. <a href="http://pdfreaders.org/">Pdfreaders.org</a> 
a site launched by the Fellowship of FSFE, provides information about Free 
Software PDF readers for all major operating systems. It clearly shows 
that there are many programs to read and write PDF documents.</p>

<ul><li>Secondly and worse, the public institution that provides you this 
link is <strong>deliberatly advertising</strong> in favor of this particular PDFreader, 
while public institutions are not supposed to prefer one product over another, 
except on the ground that it meets better its own needs. Here, the choice 
is only made on the ground of the best know reader. In doing so, governmental 
institutions give an economical advantage to the advertised product over 
its competitors.</li></ul>

<p>If you also want these advertisements to be removed from governmental websites or to have an alternative proposal of a downloading interface for free PDF-readers, sign this petition <!-- in sending your name and contacts to pdfreaders@lists.fsfe.org or in filling the following form-->.</p>
