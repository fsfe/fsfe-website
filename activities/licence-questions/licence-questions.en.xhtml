    <h1>The FSFE's Licence Questions Mailing List</h1>

    <!-- What -->
    <p>
      The FSFE’s License Questions mailing list is our group of
      volunteers dedicated to provide help with Free Software licenses
      and compliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you need advice on what Free Software licence you should use,
      or if you want to know more about what rights you have over a
      piece of Free Software, you can contact us by sending a message
      to <a
      href="mailto:licence-questions@fsfe.org">licence-questions@fsfe.org</a>.
      While the members of the Licence Questions mailing list come from
      a variety of different countries and different backgrounds, to
      ensure that you get a faster reply, it is advisable to write in
      English, as that is the language in which the internal
      discussions are held.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please understand that, as an NGO, the FSFE is neither in a
      position nor allowed to give legal advice. If that is what your
      situation requires, we will be glad to use the FSFE’s extensive
      legal contacts<a class="fn" id="ref-1" href="#fn-1">1</a> to
      point you to a specialised lawyer in your jurisdiction.
    </p>

    <!-- Who -->
    <p>
      The Licence Questions mailing list is composed of around 20
      volunteers that are experts in Free Software legal matters
      selected directly by FSFE. We consider the information shared in
      such list confidential and we will not share it with anyone
      outside this list.
    </p>

    <!-- How -->
    <p>
      Due to high levels of spam, we have to moderate all incoming
      messages. If you receive a warning after posting to the list,
      please ignore it: your email will be accepted by our moderator
      shortly after. Once an enquiry reaches the list, our experts
      discuss it internally; this might take different amounts of time
      depending on the complexity of the question. When the list
      reaches a general consensus, we will write you directly with our
      answer.
    </p>
