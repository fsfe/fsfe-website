    <p id="introduction">
      FSFE believes that access to software determines who may
      participate in digital society.  The freedoms to
      <a href="/about/basics/freesoftware.html">use, study, share, and improve</a>
      software are necessary for equal participation in the information age.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is a non-profit
      non-governmental organisation active in
      <a href="/contact/local.html">many European countries</a> and involved in
      many global activities.  Access to software determines participation in a
      digital society:  To secure equal participation in the information age,
      as well as freedom of competition, the Free Software Foundation Europe
      pursues and is dedicated to the furthering of Free Software; defined by
      the freedoms to use, study, modify and copy.  Founded in 2001, creating
      awareness for these issues, securing Free Software politically and
      legally, and giving people Freedom by supporting development of Free
      Software are central issues of the FSFE.
