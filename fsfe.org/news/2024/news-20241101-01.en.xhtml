<p>As one of Europe’s most established annual events on Free Software 
in Italy, <a href="https://www.sfscon.it/">SFSCON</a> promotes the use of Free Software in digital 
infrastructure as a tool to achieve innovation and competitiveness. 
Taking place in November, the conference features a dynamic line-up of 
leading experts, workshops, and discussions to  highlight current 
trends, challenges, and opportunities within the Free Software 
community.</p> 

<p>SFSCON is also the place where the European SFS Award  2024 is 
presented. This recognition, from the FSFE and the Linux User Group 
Bozen-Bolzano-Bulsan, honours outstanding Free Software developers who 
have significantly advanced the spread and advocacy of Free Software 
across Europe. Last year the award went to <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20231110-01.html">Nextcloud founder Frank 
Karlitschek</a>. Upon learning the name of this year’s recognition, our 
colleague Lucas Lasota will take the stage to deliver a keynote 
speech.</p>

<p>As in previous editions, the FSFE will also contribute with talks 
and workshops, including a session on our <a 
href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/for-the-right-of-general-purpose-computers/">DMA 
litigation case</a> and the 
pressing <a

for sustainable, long-term financial support</a>. You can 
also stop by our booth to chat with us, pick up some promotional 
materials, browse our merchandise, or simply say hello! Explore the 
entire <a href="https://www.sfscon.it/programs/2024/">SFSCON 2024 
Programme</a> to discover all activities planned for 
this year’s edition. Join us at the NOI Techpark in Bolzano!</p>

<h2>NGI: A successful EU initiative that shows the need for sustainable, long-term financial support for Free Software</h2>

<p><strong><a 
href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/lessons-from-the-eus-next-generation-internet-initiatives/">Lessons 
from the EU’s Next Generation Internet Initiatives: What We've Learnt 
From Looking At 500 Free Software Projects</a></strong><br/> 8 November, 
14:00h. - Seminar 1<br/> Lina Ceballos, our Policy Project Manager will 
speak about some simple trends in Free Software legal and licensing that 
we’ve observed over the years in independent Free Software projects and 
their developers, and how these affect aspects of the Free Software 
ecosystem.</p>


<p><strong><a 
href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/ngi-no-more-eu-funding-for-free-software/">NGI: 
No more EU funding for Free Software?!</a></strong><br/> 8 November, 
14:40h. - Seminar 2<br/> Later that same day, in the Seminar 2, 
Alexander Sander, FSFE’s Senior Policy Consultant will show the urgent 
need for sustainable, long-term financial support for Free Software to 
ensure Europe’s technological independence. The <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240719-01.html">decision to cut funding</a> 
resulted in a loss of €27 million for software freedom. Since 2018, the 
European Commission has supported the Free Software ecosystem through 
NGI, that provided funding and technical assistance to Free Software 
projects. The ease with which this funding was excluded underlines this 
need.</p>


<h2>Policy and Software Freedom</h2>
<p>
<strong><a 
href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/cra-pld-liability-rules-and-software-freedom/">CRA 
&amp; PLD Liability rules and Software Freedom</a></strong><br/> 8 
November, 11:40h.- Seminar 1<br/> With the Cyber Resilience Act and 
Product Liability Directive liability rules for software have been 
introduced with a broad exception for Free Software. In this talk 
Alexander Sander will discuss what this new regulation means for 
software freedom in future and what happens at this stage and how to be 
involved in implementation.

<strong><a 
href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/for-the-right-of-general-purpose-computers/">We 
went to court against Apple – a case for Software 
Freedom: Breaking lock-ins over devices with Free 
Software</a></strong><br/> 8 November, 12:40h. - Seminar 1<br/>
Lucas Lasota, FSFE’s Legal Programme Manager will 
	explain why FSFE’s litigation against Apple represents a key case for 
	Software Freedom. The talk will present how Device Neutrality – a 
	solution to enable end-users to bypass gatekeepers in order to run Free 
	Software independently of the control exercised by hardware 
	manufacturers is at stake.</p>

<p><strong><a 
href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/tackling-openwashers-freeloaders-and-cuckoos/">Tackling 
Openwashers, Freeloaders and Cuckoos: How to 
safeguard the Free Software market against unfair 
competition</a></strong><br/> 8 November, 16:00h. - Seminar 1<br/> 
Companies that produce and sell Free Software face a problem: some 
competitors use problematic means to compete, making their products 
cheaper and winning bids. This kind of market behaviour is increasingly 
becoming a threat for Free Software producers. In this talk Johannes 
Näder, Senior Project Manager, will take a closer look at such 
problematic practices and show why they harm Free Software 
manufacturers and the Free Software ecosystem., before discussing ways 
to limit their success.</p>

<h2>Diving into the Fediverse</h2>

Our Internet workshop</a></strong><br/> 9 November, 
10:40h. - Seminar 2<br/> Starting with the “Knitting Our Internet” 
workshop, we will dive in into the history of the Internet, and how it

decentralized networks. The workshop questions the very essence of 
today’s social media, exposing the critical limits posed by 
centralization, monopoly, and surveillance.</p>


<p><strong><a href="https://www.sfscon.it/talks/aboutfediverse/">about:Fediverse</a></strong><br/>
11 November, 11:40h. - Seminar 2<br/>
In this talk, Tobias Diekershoff, FSFE’s System Administrator will 
give a short introduction to the Fediverse of 2024 and how it started 
to evolve in 2008. A network where users can share and interact with 
each other regardless of the platform they use.  What is possible in 
the Fediverse of 2024 today? What will be possible in the future? And 
how can you get started today?</p>

different EU languages, more about our initiatives!<br/><br/>In 
addition, our partnership with the ITS Academy Last and the Edulife 
Foundation will continue, so we will meet a second year of ITS students 
during SFSCON: we will welcome them in an official meeting and give them 
some recommendations for talks to attend so they can make the most out 
of it.

<p>See all of you at SFSCON!</p>
