	<h1>Help the FSFE to connect with representatives</h1>

<p>Developed by the Free Software Foundation Europe,
MP Explore is a Free Software tool to
help us reaching out to representatives in Parliaments across Europe. We
need your help! Contribute by adding your local, regional, and national

<p>MP Explore is a tool designed to retrieve official and publicly
available up-to-date contact information about Members of Parliament
(MPs). This information, alongside other capabilities, such as
filtering, is important for the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE)
policy activities to effectively reach representatives from several
parliaments. MP Explore allows to obtain this data from any number of
sources, therefore becoming an effective tool to obtain such information
of political representatives.</p>

<h2>Contributing to MP Explore</h2>
<p>MP Explore relies on well-maintained data sources that collect
up-to-date, official, and accurate information of MPs across Europe.
Such data sources are based on official and publicly accessible sources
from parliaments. Currently, we have developed data sources for the
European Parliament, the German Parliament (<em>Bundestag</em>), and the
North Rhine-Westphalia State Parliament (Germany).</p>

<p>When data is not readily accessible in well-established data formats
from official sources, it can be difficult to explore all of the
different representative bodies while trying to get the nuance of the
different local, regional, or national political systems right. In order
to build a resilient and modular system, your help is needed! Contribute
by creating data sources for MP Explore!</p>

<p>Helping us connect with representatives by building sources for
local, regional, and national parliaments is the best way to get
involved. This is a <a
href="https://git.fsfe.org/mp-explore/documentation/src/branch/main/community/sources.md">documented</a>
process and the FSFE team can guide you throughout it. Before taking up
on the challenge of creating your own MP Explore data source, we
encourage you to contact us by sending an e-mail to <a
href="mailto:contact@fsfe.org">contact@fsfe.org</a>. This allows us to
better coordinate efforts and ensure a well-maintained, reliable, and
vibrant ecosystem of data sources.</p>

<p>Aside from taking up the challenge of creating your own data sources
for local, regional, and national parliaments, you can also contribute
to our work towards Software Freedom <a
href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">by becoming a supporter or
donating</a>.</p>


<h2 id="using-mp-explore">Using MP Explore</h2>

<p>In order to use MP Explore, you need to create a workflow. Workflows
define from where are you getting which data, what to do with that data, and how to store it. For
example, a workflow allows you to store the information of members of a
given committee in a CSV file. Workflows are one of the building blocks
of the MP Explore ecosystem.</p>

<p>We have developed two end-user tools, <a
href="https://git.fsfe.org/mp-explore/mp-explore/src/branch/main/mp_explore_cli">MP
Explore CLI</a> and <a
href="https://git.fsfe.org/mp-explore/mp-explore-ui">MP Explore
UI</a>, to simplify the execution of such workflows. You may find <a
href="https://git.fsfe.org/mp-explore/library/src/branch/main/LICENSE">CC0
1.0</a> licensed workflows to build upon in the <a
href="https://git.fsfe.org/mp-explore/library/src/branch/main">Library
of Workflows</a>.</p>

<p>A key aspect of tailored and strategic communication is collaboration
and coordination, which ensures that our efforts best contribute to the
advancement of Software Freedom. Therefore, we encourage you to send an
e-mail to <a href="mailto:contact@fsfe.org">contact@fsfe.org</a> if you
are planning to contact representatives on topics related to Free
Software. We have a lot of experience in this area and would be happy to
support you in your efforts.</p>
