	<p>Free Software is software that guarantees a set of freedoms to its users. It is 'free' as in freedom not as in 'free of charge'. Although <a href="/about/basics/freesoftware.html#terminology">a variety of terms</a> are used to refer to it, at FSFE <a href="/documents/whyfs.html">we prefer to talk about Free Software</a> because this better reflects the philosophy of the <a href="/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.html">four freedoms</a> which are intrinsic to it. </p>
      
    </div>
    
    <p>The Free Software movement was started by Richard Stallman in 1983 when he inaugurated the <a href="/freesoftware/basics/gnuproject.html">GNU project</a>. This was based on the idea that people should have full control over the software they own. Stallman recognised that in order to achieve this, access to a computer program's <a href="/freesoftware/basics/sourcecode.html">source code</a> was a fundamental requirement. Beyond the realm of just the computer industry, the struggle for Free Software has extended to the adoption of laws on <a href="/activities/os/os.html">open standards</a>.</p>
