<h1>Who owns Free Software?</h1>

<h2>Conceptions of ownership</h2>

<p>Software is an intangible thing. It can be thought of as a set of ideas, and as such traditional ideas of ownership which affect objects like food and land do not apply to it. Therefore when we talk about intangible things like software, different conceptions of ownership apply, and these can typically be split into three categories:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Copyright</li>
	<li>Patents</li>
	<li>Authorship</li>
</ol>

<p>Copyright is a widely used set of laws which grants exclusive rights to creative work such as illustrations, various forms of music, and literature and software. It is a government imposed exclusive monopoly on ideas, and provides a legal and conceptual framework for the private ownership of intangible things.</p>

<p>Patents are separate system which relate specifically to industrial processes, and like Copyright they provide a legal and conceptual framework for the private ownership and restriction of ideas in this category. Patents have very different aims and restrictions to Copyright however, and generally only affect the activities of corporations.</p>

<p>Authorship relates to the original creator(s) of an idea, and the moral rights that those creators have to the idea in a legal and moral sense. Moral rights are legally recognised in most countries and allow authors, amongst other things, to prevent their work from being used in a way which would damage their reputation. Many people also recognise an informal right of authors to have their work attributed to them (ie for their work to carry a notice stating who the original author was), although this moral right to attribution is not protected by law unless the author has legally retained this right, which is commonly not the case.</p>

<p>Generally Copyright has the greatest impact on what we can and can't do with software. For simplicity this shall be the focus of this article.</p>

<h2>Legal ownership</h2>

<p>The copyright to software is always owned by someone, be it a group or an individual. The only exception is software that has been released into the Public Domain, which has no owner and absolutely no restrictions on its use [][]. This is also true of Free Software. Different Free Software projects have different policies concerning who is the copyright owner of the code.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel, for example, has thousands of owners, each of whom hold the copyright to the parts of the kernel that they have written and contributed to the larger project. The Linux kernel's policy is that contributors retain copyright ownership of their work, but it also requires that all contributions use a Free Software license []. Other projects take a different approach. Mozilla Firefox, for example, requires that the copyright ownership of all contributions are assigned to the Mozilla Foundation, which is a non-profit organisation with legal responsibility to use its ownership of Firefox for the public benefit.</p>

<p>Free Software does have legally recognised owners therefore, and typical Free Software users are not amongst them. Who owns the copyright of Free Software is important for legal procedures, such as updating the Free Software license to a new one (eg. from GPLv2 to GPLv3), and ensuring that the Free Software license is complied with (and the right to take legal action to protect freedoms when necessary). <em>Copyright ownership does not affect your rights to Free Software however</em>.</p>

<h2>A more important kind of ownership</h2>

<p>Free Software licenses are unique in that they use copyright law to grant to the public the freedoms that are usually reserved for the copyright owner. The 'PL' in 'GPL' stands for 'Public License'; the license hands the most important rights to everybody ('The Four Freedoms'). Critically, Free Software licenses are also irrevocable. Once software has been published under such a license it will forever be publicly available, and no change of heart, corporate merger, or legal argument can restrict our access to it [].</p>

<p>Everybody 'owns' rights to Free Software therefore; <em>we all have inalienable rights to use it as we wish in a way which is traditionally associated with legal copyright ownership</em>. In this wider sense of ownership we all "own" Free Software. Some Free Software advocates refer to Free Software as being "publicly owned". Non-Free software is often referred to as being 'proprietary', which highlights this distinction in who "owns" rights to the software in question.</p>

<p>Whoever owns the copyright to Free Software always has the most rights in relation to it. Owners of Free Software choose to use their rights to share their rights as widely as possible. Therefore in a narrow legal sense Free Software is privately owned by software developers, foundations and companies. In a wider sense however we all own Free Software, because our freedom to use, modify, share, and improve it are guaranteed.</p>

<p>[] Though there are no copyright restrictions on works in the public domain, there may be other restrictions, such as restrictions on the distribution of software deemed to post a risk to national security in the United States, for example.
[] Executable files which are in the Public Domain do not necessarily have their source code similarly available.
[] Specifically, the Linux Kernel is licensed as GPLv2.
[] Only a fundamental change in international copyright law could affect the public's rights to Free Software for the worse, and currently this looks likely to occur in the foreseeable future.</p>
