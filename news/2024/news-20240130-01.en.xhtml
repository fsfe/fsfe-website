<p>FOSDEM brings together thousands of Free Software enthusiasts in 
Brussels on the first weekend of February each year to discuss Free 
Software related topics. Once again, we are participating in this 
two-day event at the Free University of Brussels with our booth, the 
Legal and Policy Devroom that we co-organize, and other interesting 
talks. Our team will be there ready to meet you, engage in fruitful 
discussions, and network with the Free Software community. Come along to 
check out our socks and t-shirts, along with a bunch of freshly-printed 
stickers!

<h3>Saturday, 3 February</h3> 
<p>
From Saturday, as usual, you will find us around, mainly at our booth. 
Whether you are a newcomer or a Free Software expert, our team will be happy 
to meet you at the FSFE booth. Come to chat with us and discuss of 
Free Software, get informed about our activities, share with us your 
impressions about our new stickers, and add a new t shirt - or a pair of 
socks - to your wardrobe. Our booth is the best place to find our team!

interest in these topics. Our Legal and Policy Issues Devroom is taking

Although we hope we do not have a lot of merchandise left at the end 
of the conference, tearing down the booth is usually not an easy task so 
we might need extra hands on Sunday. Contact our Office Assistant, 
Francesca, at <email>fi@fsfe.org</email> if you can join us!
