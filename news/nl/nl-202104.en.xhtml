    <p>In our April Newsletter read about our Router Freedom Activity Package, our interview with former Vice President Fernanda Weiden, our new Software Freedom Podcast with Elisa Lindinger, our Spring Sales and as usual our other diverse community activities.</p>

    <p>Router Freedom is the right that consumers of any Internet Service Provider (ISP) have to choose and use a private modem and router instead of equipment that the ISP provides. In the context of reform of telecommunications law, since June 2020 <a href="/news/2020/news-20200601-01.html">a new set of rules guides the implementation of Router Freedom in Europe</a>. </p>

    <p>Although the new rules will provide more clarity in several respects concerning end-users&#39; rights, the awareness of Router Freedom is low across Europe. Active participation of local communities in the legislative processes of laws impacting the ability of end-users to choose their network devices is crucial for leveraging the protection of Router Freedom in national jurisdictions. </p>

    <p>Therefore, we have <a href="/news/2021/news-20210330-01.html">prepared an activity package for individuals and organisations</a> who want to communicate with regulators and decision makers of  their countries and take a stand for Router Freedom. The package consists of an <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-router-freedom-activity-summary.pdf">activity summary</a>, a <a href="/news/2021/news-20210330-01.html#id-monitoring-map">monitoring map</a> and a <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/CompulsoryRouters/">wiki page</a> with relevant information for local engagement. </p>

    <p>We would love to know more about your experience with Router Freedom, so we can act accordingly. Please participate in our <a href="https://survey.fsfe.org/index.php/628449?lang=en">end-user survey</a>. It will take only a few minutes!</p>
    


    
    <h2 id="20-years-fsfe-interview-with-fernanda-weiden">20 Years FSFE: Interview with Fernanda Weiden</h2>

    <p>In our third birthday publication <a href="/news/2021/news-20210420-01.html">we interview Fernanda &quot;nanda&quot; Weiden</a> who was raised n Porto Alegre, Brasil, where she organised FISL, the largest Free Software conference in Latin America. Later she became a founding member and council member of the Free Software Foundation Latin America, before moving to Europe, where she joined the FSFE as a volunteer. Just a little bit later she was elected Vice President of the Free Software Foundation Europe from 2009-2011.</p>

    <p>In these early years of her engangement with the FSFE, Fernanda helped to shape the FSFE&#39;s profile and organisation. Her favourite campaign that she was heavily contributing to was the Document Freedom Day, a campaign to highlight the importance of Open Standards and a global day to celebrate them. Fernanda is also co-founder of the &quot;Women in Free Software Project&quot; in Brazil and former member of &quot;Debian Women&quot;. Until today Fernanda is part of the FSFE&#39;s General Assembly and helps the organisation with her manifold professional skills if needed.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>With a groundbreaking resolution, Dortmund has committed itself to the use of Free Software. With an overwhelming, cross-faction majority, <a href="/news/2021/news-20210331-01.html">the city council has paved the way for &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot;</a> In the future, software developed or commissioned by the administration will be made available to the general public.</li>
        <li>Max Mehl, FSFE programme manager, gave a talk on <a href="http://www.europe-direct-dortmund.de/event/digitale-souveraenitaet-in-europa-freie-und-open-source-software-als-schluessel/">&quot;Digital Sovereignty in Europe - Free Software as the Key&quot;</a> in which he provided an overview of the most important contexts and discussed pragmatic possibilities based on existing examples to put public digital infrastructure on a modern footing.</li>
        <li>Ralf Hersel, Coordinator of the FSFE local Zurich group, gave a presentation on &quot;Learning like the Pros&quot; <a href="https://openeducationday.ch/programm-2021/">during the Open Education Day conference</a>. Learning like the Pros informs about Digital Sovereignty, explains professional approaches and offers concrete suggestions.</li>
        <li>For the International Transgender Day of Visibility, Carmen Bianca Bakker writes about <a href="https://www.carmenbianca.eu/en/post/2021-03-31-whats-in-a-name/">&quot;What&#39;s in a name?&quot;</a></li>

The course is dedicated to several elements that compose the terms that are being discussed in public debates, but from the legal perspective.</li>

    <p>Although Spring seems a little bit late this year in Northern Europe, we have started <a href="/news/2021/news-20210406-01.html">the FSFE Spring Sales</a> in which we offer all our coloured T-shirts, magnets, pins, gym sacks and children's shirts at a reduced price for a short period. Be quick, because the offer is only valid while stock lasts. Moreover, sale products that are sold out will no longer be reordered as we will refresh our inventory.</p>
