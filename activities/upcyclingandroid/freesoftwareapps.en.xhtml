  <p>
    Luckily, the Google Play Store is not the only source to obtain apps for your Android devices. Luckily because there are several issues with the Google Play Store: It offers you non-free and intransparent software, let alone the fact that using Google Play Store also requires a Google account and Google software that continuously spies on you and tracks your behaviour. In sum, it is recommended to not use this market at all. 
        </p>

    <div class="infoitem">
      <h2 class="painted" id="Fdroid">F-Droid</h2>
      <div class="with-image-left">
        <img alt="F-Droid logo" src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/thumb/e50bafbaaf03067800de118043ed2ee5.jpeg" />
      <p>
        The <a href="http://f-droid.org/">F-Droid initiative</a> introduced an installable catalogue of easily-installable Free Software applications for the Android platform. In practice, F-Droid is like other stores that make it easy to browse applications, install them onto your device, and keep track of updates. With the difference being that in F-Droid all applications are Free Software. 
      </p>

      <p>The F-Droid store is not available in any other store. If your custom ROM does not come with f-droid pre-installed or you like to try F-Droid in your stock Android, you need to download it from ist homepage and manually install it on your phone once. To help you get started, we produced a <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#f-droid">leaflet that explains the installation and use of F-Droid</a>. It also includes some recommendations of pretty good Free Software Apps for you to use.</p>
      
      <div class="color-box background rounded" data-color="android-lime">
        <p>
          <a href="https://f-droid.org/">Get F-Droid</a>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>The F-Droid store has many benefits in comparison to the Google Play store: It only offers you Free Software apps, no account is needed and you can use it anonymously. There are no hidden costs and the store is transparent about any <a href="https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/AntiFeatures">antifeatures</a> an app contains.</p>

      <p>If you have installed a Custom-ROM and you like to avoid Google after all, the best option is to install F-Droid and get your apps from there.</p>

      <p>If you still have your default Android installed, we recommend to look which app you can better install via the F-Droid store instead of the non-free Google Play Store (you will see that many apps are available in both stores) and what other interesting apps you find in F-Droid that you do not find in the Google store. To get you started we created the list below with some recommendation.</p>

      Nowadays, we fortunately live in a world in which we can choose from
      various Free Software apps for almost any use case. So many, that it is impossible to list them all. This section only aims at presenting a small selection to help you get started.</p>
      <p>Being listed here does not mean the app is of higher quality than another. We mainly selected them based on their popularity and we encourage you to discover the best apps by yourself and browse the <a

    <h2 class="painted" id="web-browsing">Web browsing</h2>
    
    
    <p>Web browser are among the most used apps on any smartphone. There are plenty of browsers available on F-Droid, from <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid">Firefox</a> to the <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.stoutner.privacybrowser.standard">Privacy Browser</a> to <a href="https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/">Tor</a> and many more. We can only list the two most popular ones below:</p>

    <div class="infoitem">
      <h3 id="Fennec">Fennec</h3>
      <div class="with-image-left">
        <img alt="Fennec logo" src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/thumb/1e013e5145aaf5732b5b78fb9f7f5f5d.jpeg" />
      <p>If you like the Mozilla Firefox, then <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/">Fennec F-Droid</a> will be your choice. Fennec F-Droid is based on the latest Firefox release (codenamed Fenix). It has proprietary bits and telemetry removed, but still connects to various Mozilla and Google services that can track users. </p>

      <p>If you like Chromium, then <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.anddevw.getchromium/">getChromium</a> will be your choice. The app is a little helper to install the latest build of Chromium for Android. Push the button to install Chromium, then push the button and install Chromium again. Each time you install Chromium it updates Chromium. Chromium unfortunately does not auto-update. </p>
      <div class="center">

    </div>


    <h2 class="painted" id="chats-and-messaging">Chats and messaging</h2> 

    <p>Again, chats and messaging clients are among the most used apps on most smartphones and naturally the choice of options is exhausting. Some of them are complete Free Software like <a href="https://signal.org/download/">Signal</a>, others only the client is Free Software, like <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.telegram.messenger/">Telegram</a>. Some are centralised, others are decentralised or can even be used offline, like <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.briarproject.briar.android">Briar</a>. Again, we can only give you a glimpse on popular apps out of many diverse available.</p>

    <div class="infoitem">
      <h3 id="Telegram">Telegram</h3>

      <p><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.telegram.messenger/">Telegram</a> is a very popular chat application whose client is available as Free Software but that unfortunately is running proprietary software in the backend.</p>
      <div class="center">
        <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.telegram.messenger/"><img class="center" width="200" src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/small/36bb0a8e207558ac55ad6379d031a266.png" /></a>

        <img alt="Chromium logo" src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/thumb/91cee811f73127dc87dd1d5397c69f23.jpeg" />
      <p><a href="https://signal.org/android/apk/">Signal</a> is becoming more and more popular as an encrpyted chat application. Its benefit is that the client as well as the server software is Free Software. Unfortunately you cannot install it directly from F-Droid but have to either include the repository in F-Droid or directly install it from the <a href="https://signal.org/android/apk/">web page</a>.</p>
        
      </div>
    </div>



    

 
   <h2 class="painted" id="social-media">Social Media</h2> 

    <p>Many social media platforms are critical to use for several reasons. Those who are proprietary and do not offer open APIs do not end up of having a client in F-Droid. If you look for access to these social media platforms read about how to connect using the <a href="#aurora">Aurora store</a>.</p>

      <p><a hef="https://microg.org/">MicroG</a> is a <em>"Free Software re-implementation of Google’s proprietary Android user space apps and libraries"</em>. In practice that means MicroG allows other Free Software apps to seamlessly integrate into the Android system without having to use proprietary Google libraries for this. This is for example useful to have accurate and fast push notifications or location services of particular apps.</p>

  <p>MicroG is <a href="https://microg.org/download.html">available as an F-Droid repository</a> but you can also download its apks directly. Free Software users get extended application support, privacy-caring users can reduce or monitor data that is sent to Google and especially older phones can expect some battery life improvements.</p>

      <p>Is there an app that you are looking for that is not available in F-Droid? Most probably this is not a bug but a feature. Because if the app you are looking for is a proprietary app you will not find it in F-Droid.</p>

      <p>So what to do if you like to use as much as Free Software as possible but no Google account and services and on the other hand there is this one app or two that you really need and that is only available in the Google Play Store? Then you can use the Free Software App store called Aurora, that is (<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/">available for download in F-droid</a>). Aurora is in App store that allows you to get Apps that are only availabe in the Google Play Store, but in a more private way. If you stick to apps that are available for no costs, you actually do not even need a Google account for downloading them. </p>

  <p> 
        An operating system is a collection of software that enables you to use
        your phone and run other applications on it. Even though Android is <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html">mostly
        free</a>, many phones ship with proprietary components and add-ons. Some
        phones also have a locked boot loader
        which prevents you from booting and installing other operating systems.
        If you want to buy an Android phone, make sure you can flash the phone.</p>

      <p>Some devices can only be unlocked with clever hacks
        and their manufacturers tend to declare your warranty void when you unlock their device's boot loader.
        But, given European  Directive 1999/44/CE, just the fact that you modified or changed the software of your device,
        is not a sufficient reason to void your statutory warranty.
        See our <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/legal.html">Upcycling Android legal page</a> for more information.
      </p>

      <p>There are
        also companies that ship their devices with an unlocked bootloader or
        provide you with the means to unlock it. These phones should be preferred for easy installs and usability.
