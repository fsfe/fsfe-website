    <title>A discussion on Supporting non-IT organisations in Frankfurt, Germany</title>

    <body>
      <p>The local FSFE Rhine-Main group hosts a meeting in Frankfurt on September 4th between 19:00h and 21:30h . The theme of the gathering is "Supporting non-IT organisations!". As more and more processes are involving software, Human Rights and other non-IT centred organisations face the need to better understand software. This knowledge becomes crucial for their work and during the meeting we will discuss ways to support such organisations and raise with them awareness of Free Software.</p>
<p>If you are interest in talking about power relations in our society that are influenced by software, what Free Software is and how it could be helpful, please join us. The meeting takes place at the Coworking Zentrale, Berger Stra√üe 175 | 60385 Frankfurt and registration is not required.</p>
