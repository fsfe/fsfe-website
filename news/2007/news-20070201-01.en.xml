    <title>FSFE releases solution to increase legal strength of Free Software projects</title>
    <body>
Today FSFE has released the Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA) under the
terms of the GNU Free Documentation Licence (GFDL) and the Creative 
Commons Attribution/Share-alike (CC by-sa) licence.  The FLA is a 
copyright assignment that allows Free Software projects to bundle their 
copyright in a single organisation or person.  It enables projects to 
ensure their legal maintainability and can be used to either assign
copyright to FSFE's Fiduciary Program or to assign the rights to 
another organisation set up by the project team itself.
