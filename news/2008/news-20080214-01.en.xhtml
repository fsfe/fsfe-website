    <h1>FSFE announces the first European Licensing and Legal Workshop for Free Software</h1>

<p>FSFE's Freedom Task Force today announces the first European Licensing and 
Legal Workshop for Free Software will be held on Friday the 11th of April in 
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  The venue for this meeting is the 
InterContinental Amstel Hotel.</p>

<p>The event is targeted towards large projects and medium to large enterprises 
wishing to discuss their existing licence compliance processes.  Parties 
attending are expected to contribute to issues ranging from process 
development through to optimising purchasing contract language for the 
benefit of the European Free Software community.</p>

<p>Harald Welte and Armijn Hemel will be attending to represent 
gpl-violations.org, and Dr. Till Jaeger will deliver a talk on licence 
enforcement.  Ciaran O'Riordan (FSFE Brussels and patent issue 
representative), Shane Coughlan (FSFE legal coordinator) and Marko Milenovic 
(FTF team member) will represent FSFE.</p>

<p>This workshop has limited space available and therefore attendance is by 
invitation only.  Projects and companies interested in attending this event 
should contact the FTF at ftf at fsfeurope.org.</p>

<p>The European Licensing and Legal Workshop for Free Software is one of the 
activities of FSFE's Freedom Task Force, also known as the FTF.  The FTF is an 
infrastructure project that can help individuals, projects and businesses 
understand Free Software licensing and the opportunities that it presents. The 
FTF works in partnership with gpl-violations.org to deal with licence 
violations in the European arena.</p>

<p>The FTF undertakes several activities, ranging from the operation of a 
European Legal and Technical Network which currently covers sixteen European 
countries and with contacts around the world through to delivering training 
and consultancy in Free Software licensing. It provides a variety of services 
for individuals, community projects and commercial businesses with the aim of 
fostering best practice throughout the industry.</p>
