    <title>Software Patents in Europe</title>
    <description>
Software patents for Europe are currently being pushed forward
actively by a lobby gathering around the European patent office and
the Business Software Alliance (BSA), which represents the interests
of the large U.S. companies. Software patents are a menace to society
and economy and the FSF Europe is actively involved in the resistance
against such plans.
