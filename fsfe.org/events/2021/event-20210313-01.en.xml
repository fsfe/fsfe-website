        <title>20 years FSFE - The long road to software freedom (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>On Saturday, 13 March, at 12:00 pm (CET), Matthias Kirschner, President of FSFE, will speak at this year's Chemnitzer Linux Days about the work of the Free Software Foundation Europe. "Public Money? Public Code", router freedom, Radio Equipment Directive, easier help with licensing or "Free Your Android". These are some of the activities FSFE has been doing since 2001 in order to enable people to use technology in a self-determined way. On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Free Software Foundation Europe, Kirschner gives an insight into the way the FSFE works, using concrete examples from the areas of public relations, policy work and legal actions, and presents possibilities for cooperation. It is no registration required.</p>
