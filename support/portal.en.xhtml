        <!-- In future here should just be some short information wih a link to our community-portal. As this is not-ready and only living on test.fsfe.org, we keep the following text for now. This change should be done soon, so our translators do not have to translate stuff that will soon not be on the page -->

         <p>You are more than welcome to discuss recent news or general questions about Free Software and the FSFE on our <a href="https://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/discussion">general discussion list</a> or in <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo">one of our specific country lists</a>. If you are looking for local contact, see our <a href="/about/localteams.en.html">local FSFE groups list</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, the FSFE is a non-profit organisation that is enabled by individual donations. Consider to <a href="/fellowship">join the Fellowship</a> if you like to support our work financially.</p>
