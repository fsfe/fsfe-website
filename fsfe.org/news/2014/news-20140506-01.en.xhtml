    <h1>Open Letter to European Commission: Stop DRM in HTML5</h1>

    <p>On today's <a href="http://dayagainstdrm.org/">"Day
      against DRM"</a>, the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) has sent <a
      href="/activities/drm/open-letter-ec-drm-html.html">an open letter to the
      European Commission, asking the EC to prevent Digital
      Restrictions Management technology from being closely integrated
      with the HTML5 standard</a>.</p>

    <p>FSFE is concerned about efforts currently in progress at the
    World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), to encourage the integration of Digital
    Restriction Management (DRM) technology into web browsers. The 
    W3C oversees many of the key standards on which the World Wide Web
    is based.</p>

    <p>
    A W3C working group is currently standardising an "Encrypted Media
    Extension" (EME), which will allow companies to easily plug in
    non-free "Content Decryption Modules" (CDM) with DRM
    functionality, taking away users' control over their own
    computers. Most DRM technologies impose restrictions on users that
    go far beyond what copyright and consumers' rights allow.
    </p>
 
    <blockquote><p>"Integrating DRM facilities into HTML5 is the
      antithesis of everything that has made the Internet and the
      World Wide Web successful," says FSFE's President Karsten
      Gerloff. "It is directly contrary to the interests of the vast
      majority of Internet users everywhere."</p></blockquote>

    <p>Auditing the DRM modules will be both difficult and
    illegal. Their source code will be a closely held secret of the company
    which distributes the module. Performing an audit and reporting security
    flaws would also be illegal in the many countries which have
    adopted so-called "anti-circumvention" laws. Reporting a security
    problem in the DRM module would expose the reporter to the risk of
    lawsuits from the makers of that module. </p>

    <p>FSFE asks the European Commission to:</p>
    
    <ul> 
      
      <li>Engage with the W3C and ensure that the organisation takes
      these concerns on board as it decides on the adoption of the Encrypted
      Media Extension (EME).</li>
      
      <li>Pledge not to make use of the Encrypted Media Extension in
      its own infrastructure, even if EME were to be standardised by
      W3C.</li>
      
      <li>Protect people and companies from prosecution who
      reverse-engineer DRM technology and report vulnerabilities.</li>

    </ul>
