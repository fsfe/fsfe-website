   <title>"Ethical Software" meeting in Milan, Italy</title>
   <body>
Next Friday, 17th of May, from 9.30 to 13 it will take place in Milan the "Software Etico" meeting, promoted by Joomla!Lombardia. Diego Zanga, Fellow of FSFE, will cover the subject "Free Software in Public administration"

Free Software, thanks to the communities linked to projects, is today a big and accountable reality, able to give to industry and to community more advantages than propietary software.  


The main aim of the meeting is to show to local stakeholders - local administration, firms, associations, family groups, etc - that Free Software is viable, thanks to the sustainability of its business model,  and is socially ethical and fair. The meeting will be held in Italian.
