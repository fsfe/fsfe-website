    <h1>Software Patents in Europe</h1>

<div id="introduction">

    <p>
      We are working towards a world where software does what software users
      want it to do. For this, software users must be able to participate in
      the development and distribution of the software. Software patents block
      this goal by adding legal and financial risks to software development and
      distribution and by giving the patent holders legal power to completely
      prohibit software developers from using the patented ideas.
    </p>

  <h2 id="status">Current status</h2>

<p>
  The future of software patents in Europe is uncertain. The Software Patent
  Directive was rejected by the European Parliament on the 6th of July 2005,
  after seven years of campaigning by people in FSFE and other organisations -
  most notably, one of our associate organisations, <a
    href="http://www.ffii.org/">FFII</a>.  This was a monumental victory and
  displays the legislative competence of the Free Software community.  However,
  the struggle is not over.  Information about the current status of software
  patents in the EU can be found in this November 2007 blog entry: <a
    href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/ciaran/?p=115">Do software patents exist in the
    EU?</a> 
</p>

<p>
  The software patent issue is likely to return via initiatives such as the
  Community Patent or the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA).  The
  details of how these initiatives could introduce software patents are
  described in this August 2006 blog entry: <a
    href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/ciaran/?p=49">The Future of the Patents
    Battle</a>.  FSFE continues to work on this.

    <h2 id="about">About the problem</h2>

    <p>
      The Free Software Foundation Europe is actively working against
      the introduction of software patents in Europe.  Software
      patents create the following problems.
    </p>
    
    <ul>

      <li>Add legal risks, and therefore costs, to software development</li>

      <li>Specifically inhibit the development of useful software by
      blocking compatibility and interoperability</li>

      <li>Patents are incompatible with software because software is
      so complex - too many ideas are used for it to be practical to
      count them and check them against existing patents</li>

    </ul> 

    <p>
      To understand how patents work, it is important to realise that
      they have almost nothing in common with copyright.  While
      Copyright is granted on the the work of an author, such as a
      computer program, patents are granted on ideas that could be
      used inside a computer program.  So when thinking of Patents,
      think of "symphony combining wind and string instruments" and
      not "Beethoven's 2nd symphony."
