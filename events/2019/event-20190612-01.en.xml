    <body>
      <p>On June 13th, the FSFE's president Matthias Kirschner will give a keynote about Free Software in our society at OW2con. He will argue that as people and companies who create software, we should consider how our actions influence the distribution of power in our society â€” and thereby our democracy. The event takes place on 12 and 13 of June. Entrance is free of charge but with prior registration required.</p>
