      <p>
      After a long time of planning the Styrian Fellowship group is
      proud to announce their first Fellowship meeting, which we hope to
      turn into a regular event. The meeting starts at 19:00 in
      the <a href="http://www.realraum.at/">Realraum</a>, Jakoministra√üe
      16, Graz. It's a joint meeting with the Realraumgruppe.  As usual,
      this invitation is for everyone interested in the FSFE or Free
      Software. We're looking forward to seeing you there!
