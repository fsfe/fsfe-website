      After eight years of running our <a href="http://documentfreedom.org/">Document Freedom Day</a> campaign, <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2016/news-20160126-01">in 2016 the FSFE handed over</a> the organisation of the campaign to the Digital Freedom Foundation. We still have, however, some stock material that we send out. It will not be reproduced. Get yours before it is too late.
