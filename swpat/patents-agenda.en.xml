In the ACT REVISING THE CONVENTION ON THE GRANT OF EUROPEAN PATENTS
the computer programs are confirmed to be out of the scope of
patentable inventions.

That point was stated explicitly in the <a href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/news/pressrel/2000_11_29_e.htm"> Statement by Dr Roland Grossenbacher, Chairman of the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation</a>
as follows:
<quote>
First, I should point out that the Conference agreed not to delete
computer programs from the list of non-patentable inventions. For the
meantime, the existing legal position therefore remains unchanged. The
Conference's decision took account of the process of consultation on
the future of legal protection in this field, and in no way challenges
the existing practice of the Office and its boards of appeal, or that
of national patent authorities and courts. As before,
computer-implemented inventions can be patented if they involve a new
and inventive technical contribution to the state of the
art. Technical solutions for use in data processing or for carrying
out methods of doing business therefore remain patentable.

The Committee on Patent Law and the Administrative Council have advocated the

The EPO and the Boards of Appeal have always interpreted and applied the EPC in
such a way that this exception in no way excludes appropriate protection for
software­related inventions, ie inventions whose subject­matter consists of or
includes a computer program. Indeed, more recent decisions of the Boards of
Appeal (see T 1173/97 ­ Computer program product/IBM, OJ EPO 1999, 609) have
confirmed that computer programs producing a technical effect, as a rule, are
patentable subject­matter under the EPC.

Gilles Savary - Député Européen (France) <br />

Je pense que nous devons distinguer les concepts de droits d'auteur
des concepts de brevetabilité. Les droits d'auteur peuvent à la limite
se concevoir, car ils sont la rémunératon d'une création et de sa
diffusion; la brevetabilité est au contraire l'appropriation privée
d'une diffusion qui est une diffusion extrêmement encadrée et donc
privative pour le plus grand nombre.

The purpose was to determine how to ensure that intellectual property
rights could continue, in the new dimate of information society, to 
meet their twofold objective : encouraging inovation and guaranteeing
the sharing of knowledge.
<p />
Portions of this study were used by french government officials during

Jörg Tauss - chairman of the German Parliamentary Commission on the New Media
<p />
 In the circles of technological policy experts, you can often here people asserting that the patent system must be extended to certain areas of information technology, whose investments would otherwise not be sufficiently protected. This assertion has however until now always been touted like a self-evident truth, and nobody I know of ever cared to substantiate it in the light of facts from the German or European IT economy.
<p />
Even if the patent advocates succeeded in finding areas of information technology, in which patents are having or have had some positive effects, it would nonetheless still be necessary to investigate, whether these effects are not outweighed by possible detrimental side-effects of the patent system.
<p />
But while the legislative authorities are still completely clueless on this matter, the judicial authorities are already taking action, granting thousands of software patents and pressing for a change of the legal rules. We as legislators should therefore now take up these questions with highest priority.
