 1. Approval of protocol of 2002 general assembly
 ------------------------------------------------

Everyone receives a printed copy of the 2002 protocol and is given
the time to read it thoroughly.

Approved [5 yes, 0 no, 1 abst]


 2. Report of Executive Committee
 --------------------------------

The Executive Committee distributes to every participant a printed
report of activities, and everyone reads it.

The Executive Committee verbally adds information to what's written
in the report.


 3. Reports of Extended Executive Committee
 ------------------------------------------

In absence of the Head of Office, the chairman provided a printed
financial overview until June 20th 2003, together with a signed
written communication by Martin Gerwinski, who leads the books on
behalf of Peter Gerwinski, Head of Office.

Peter Gerwinski reported by email on June 21st 2003, before the
beginning of the General Assembly, that for personal reasons he will
not be able to continue to work as Head of Office in the future.

The General Assembly wants to thank Peter for his continued work and
dedication as Head of Office.


 4. Exoneration of Executive Committee and Extended Executive Committee
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Exoneration of the President: 

Approved [6 yes, 0 no, 0 abst]

Exoneration of the Vice President, Jonas Oberg who's been appointed
Vice President in 2001 after Loic Dachary resigned: 

Approved [6 yes, 0 no, 0 abst]

Exoneration of the former Vice President, Loic Dachary: 

Approved [5 yes, 0 no, 1 abst]

The General Assembly notes that Peter Gerwinski did not provide
official written documents about the rent of the Office rooms and the
t-shirt production in 2001.

On request of the General Assembly, we vote on the following
conditional exoneration:

Peter Gerwinski is exonerated as Head of the Office as soon as he
provides the missing documents in a way that is acceptable to the
Extended Executive Commitee. 

Approved [5 yes, 0 no, 1 abst]


 5. Election of new Executive Committee
 --------------------------------------

Bernhard Reiter proposes to elect Georg Greve as President of the
FSFE. 

Approved [5 yes, 0 no, 1 abst]

Georg Greve accepts.


 6. Election of new Extended Executive Committee
 -----------------------------------------------

Stefano Maffulli proposes to elect Jonas Oberg as Vice President of
the FSFE. 

Approved [6 yes, 0 no, 0 abst]

Jonas had already informed the General Assembly that he would accept
the position.

Alessandro Rubini proposes to elect Werner Koch as Head of Office.
The General Assembly is happy that Werner offers to take up
responsibility for the Office on this short notice, but the General
Assembly is aware that he will not be able to dedicate as much
time to the position as expected from a regular Head of Office.

Approved [6 yes, 0 no, 0 abst]


 7. Vote upon desirability of federal structure
 ----------------------------------------------

The proponents of this point in the agenda are not present to explain
 what is desirable.

The General Assembly reckons that the Constitution states that the
FSFE has a federal structure (Paragraph 6.1).  The General Assembly
unanimously supports that structure.

After discussion, the General Assembly concludes that it is not
possible to call for a contructive vote.


 8. Change of contract with Georg Greve
 --------------------------------------

The FSF Europe wants to enter into a Consultancy Agreement with
Georg Greve.

Due to the financial situation, a continued employment of Mr. Georg
Greve under the conditions of the agreement concluded on August
1, 2001, is not possible, because the
Federal Insurance Institution For Employees
("Bundesversicherungsanstalt", "BfA") is further on of the opinion,
that his employment on the basis of that employment contract is
subject to social insurance contributions. A new agreement is proposed
to reflect the necessary legal and factual modifications.

Since the legal counsel of the FSFE, Dr. Till Jaeger, made the new
draft contract available briefly before the general assembly, the
General Assembly appoints the Vice President to sign the contract
after three weeks to allow further checking. 

The new contract shall be enacted to be effective starting with Jul
1st 2003.

The FSFE and Georg Greve agree that the old contract terminates today.

Approved [5 yes, 0 no, 1 abst]


 9. Future plans for the FSFE
 ----------------------------

In addition to the more general long-term plans, the General Assembly
wants to stress the need for the following major activities:

- participate as FS counsel in EC projects, such as GNUBILE;

- organize a meeting with our associate organizations and FS activists
	around Europe.

Approved [6 yes, 0 no, 0 abst]


 10. Miscellaneous
 -----------------

There were no miscellaneous issues brought up.


19:30. Closed by the chairman.
