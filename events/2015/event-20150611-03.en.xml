   <title>Local FSFE meeting in Berlin, Germany</title>
   <body>
     <p>
   On Thursday, June 11 , there is the next local FSFE meeting Berlin, as usual in the e-lok (near Ostkreuz). This time we come together to think about FSFE's possibilites to encourage or support movements that work to establish Free Software inside our educational system. No presentation this time - just discussing. You can get good food and best drinks at e-lok for a reasonable price and good mood for no cost. Official start is at 19:30.
