	Welcome to the home page of the Free Software Foundation Europe. The
	FSF Europe was launched March 10th 2001 and works towards all European
	aspects of Free Software and especially the <a
	href="documents/gnuproject.html">GNU Project</a>.  It is actively
	supporting development of Free Software and furthering GNU-based
	systems such as GNU/Linux. Also it provides a competence center for
	politicians, lawyers and journalists in order to secure the legal,
	political and social future of Free Software.

	  <p>Launch of the <b>&quot;We speak about Free
	  Software&quot;</b> campaign: There are compelling reasons to
	  think and speak about Free Software and its philosophy. It
	  is rather common knowledge this applies to society as a
	  whole, but it has not yet been widely understood that it
	  benefits companies, as well. Therefore the FSF Europe
	  launches this campaign on behalf and with support of several
	  Free Software companies. [<a

	  <p>Over the past few months the <a
	  href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>
	  development facility, which hosts a large number of <a
	  href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free
	  Software</a> projects, has changed its policies. Features
	  for exporting a project from SourceForge have been
	  removed. The implementation used to be exclusively Free
	  Software but is now <a

	  on non-free software</a>. Finally, VA Linux has become
	  rather underhand in their attempts to grasp exclusive
	  control of contributors' work. SourceForge did a lot of good
	  for the Free Software community, but it's now time to break
	  free. [<a href="news/article2001-10-20-01.en.html">More ...</a>].
