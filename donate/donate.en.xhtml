     <h1>Donations to the FSFE</h1>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>
[ <b>Other means</b> ] 
[ <b><a href="/donate/cc">Credit Card</a></b> ] 
</p>
</div>

     <p>There are as many <a href="letter-20041209.html">reasons</a> as
     ways for people to support the <a href="/documents/whatwedo.html">work</a>
     and <a href="/documents/whyweexist.html">goals</a> of the Free Software
     Foundation Europe. The most direct one is to help us as a volunteer by
     writing free software or free documentation. We also need people to help
     us with other tasks like manning tradeshow booths and such. If you are
     interested, you can take a look at the &quot;<a
       href="/contribute/contribute.html">What
     needs to be done?</a>&quot; page.</p>

     <p>Another crucial way of supporting the FSFE is by donating money that
     will allow us to cover our expenses and pay people to work on and for Free
     Software. Of course you can decide by your own if you want to support the
     FSFE on a regular basis or with an one-time donation.</p>

     <p>The FSFE is a Europe-wide organisation that seeks
     official recognition by local authorities as a charity whenever
     possible. Depending on local laws, this may allow deducing your
     donation from taxes. Please refer to the list below for
     details.</p>

     <h2>Become a patron of the FSFE</h2>

     <p>The Free Software Foundation Europe wants to acknowledge its supporters
     and contributors in a visible fashion. We provide some titles and
     sponsoring buttons which you could get for a specific minimum donation
     within one year. Therefore we would like to ask you to send mail to
     <code><a
     href="mailto:office@fsfeurope.org">&lt;office@fsfeurope.org&gt;</a></code>
     and let us know where to send the receipt and thank-you letter. Also we'd
     like to list you on our "<a href="thankgnus.html">Thank GNUs</a>"
     page. Even if you prefer to remain anonymous, please let us know how to
     reach you, so we can thank you privately.</p>

     <p>If you are interested in announcing your contribution
     publicly, the FSFE also provides some 
     <a href="/about/graphics/sponsoring/sponsoring.en.html">sponsoring
     buttons</a> for its donors.</p>

     <p>If you donate:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>EUR 10 every month <em>OR</em> EUR 120 in a year, you'll become a
      <b>Supporter</b> of the FSFE.</li>
      <li>EUR 50 every month <em>OR</em> EUR 600 in a year, you'll
      become a <b>Contributor</b> of the FSFE.</li>
      <li>EUR 100 every month <em>OR</em> EUR 1200 in a year, you'll
      become a <b>Sustaining Contributor</b> of the FSFE.</li>
      <li>EUR 500 every month <em>OR</em> EUR 6000 in a year, you'll
      become a <b>Patron</b> of the FSFE.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>Monthly donors starting late in the year will get a
     &quot;(mm/yy-)&quot; suffixed to their listing, monthly donors
     stopping early in the year get a &quot;(-mm/yy).&quot;
     Late-starting, early-stopping donors are suffixed with a
     &quot;(mm/yy-mm/yy).&quot;</p>

     <h2>How to donate</h2>

     <p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is still growing and there may not
     yet be a local bank account that is capable of accepting tax-deductable
     donations even if your local laws allow for them. In this case you can
     donate to the central bank account (see below) or contact <a
     href="mailto:office@fsfeurope.org">our office</a> for information on how
     to donate in the most convenient way.</p>

     when stated explicitly below.</b></p>

     href="http://fsf.org.in">India</a> or in <a
