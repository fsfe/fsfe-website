	Dear Zangemann,<br />
	I used to like your inventions in fact I still like them but you are starting to use them in the wrong way. It’s not fair that some people have to eat, drink and listen to music they don’t like. When you do that to people can see you inside and how selfish you are. It’s much better if you share your inventions because it doesn’t mean they are stealing it, it means they just are borrowing it, and making it better. So please share your ideas. It will make our planet much better.
