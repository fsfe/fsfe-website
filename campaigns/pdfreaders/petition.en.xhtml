    <h1>Petition For The Removal Of Proprietary Software Advertising On Government Websites</h1>

    <p>Each time that they redirect you to a downloading interface for a 
non-free PDFreader while you have to read a PDF file, government websites 
are advertising for proprietary software. We believe that protecting people from predatory commercial practices is one of the roles of governments and that they should therefore ensure that people are not subjected to any vendor lock-in. When they make advertisement, they should advertise Free Software PDF readers because it allows people to be independent of a single vendor.</p>

    <p>In redirecting you to a downloading interface for a proprietary PDF-reader, they commit two major mistakes :</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Firstly, they tell you that to read the PDF document, you <strong>need</strong> to download the software the proprietary software that they propose.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>This is not true. <a href="http://pdfreaders.org/">Pdfreaders.org</a> 
    a site launched by the Fellowship of FSFE, provides information about Free 
    Software PDF readers for all major operating systems. It clearly shows 
    that there are many programs to read and write PDF documents.</p>

    <ul>
    
      <li>Secondly and worse, the public institution that provides you this 
    link is <strong>deliberatly advertising</strong> in favor of this particular PDFreader, 
    while public institutions are not supposed to prefer one product over another, 
    except on the ground that it meets better its own needs. Here, the choice 
    is only made on the ground of the best know reader and despite the fact the this reader deprives you from the <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html">elementary freedoms</a> software you give to their users. In doing so, governmental 
    institutions give an economical advantage to the advertised product over 
    its competitors, and basically exclude the possibility for free software PDFreaders to be known.</li>
    
    </ul>

    <p>If you also want these advertisements for non-free PDF readers to be removed from governmental websites, sign this petition in <!--- precise how-->. It is intended t be sent to the institutions that we will have pointed doing such advertisement in order to make them change their policy.</p>
