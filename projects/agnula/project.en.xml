    <title>A GNU/Linux Audio distribution</title>
    <description>
      AGNULA's main task will be the development of two reference
   distributions for the GNU/Linux operating system completely based on
   Free Software (i.e. under a FSF approved Free Software license) and
   completely devoted to professional and consumer audio applications and
   multimedia development. One distribution will be Debian-based (DeMuDi)
   and the other will be Red Hat-based (ReHMuDi). Both will be available
   on the network for download and on CD.
