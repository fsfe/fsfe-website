    <title>Interviews for the German federal election 2021</title>
    <body>
      <p> The 2021 federal election in Germany (26.09.2021) is just around the corner. Digital
sovereignty, through the use of Free Software, is at the
centre of our exchange with the political parties, which we have also
conducted via our organisations' election questions to the parties. We are pleased
that, in a further step, we were able to talk personally with candidates
from all parties with a chance of participating in the next government and ask
them in more depth what they and their party would like to do to advance
digitisation in Germany with Free software. </p>

  <h1>Interviews for the German federal election 2021</h1>

  <p> The 2021 federal election in Germany (26.09.2021) is just around the corner. Digital
sovereignty, through the use of Free Software, is at the
centre of our exchange with the political parties, which we have also
conducted via our organisations' election questions to the parties. We are pleased
that, in a further step, we were able to talk personally with candidates
from all parties with a chance of participating in the next government and ask
them in more depth what they and their party would like to do to advance
digitisation in Germany with Free software. </p>


<p>There are many encouraging signals that the importance of Free Software
is recognised and addressed by all the parties surveyed. In the end, it
will be important for this to find its way into political work and for
sovereign solutions to be used, especially in the public sector. We
thank all politicians for their support and look forward to continuing
the dialogue after the election when it comes to negotiating the
coalition agreement and starting the substantive work in parliament and
government. We will publish an interview conducted by Alexander Sander
from FSFE and Karl Krüger from OSB Alliance every day from today onwards.
Interviews are in German.
