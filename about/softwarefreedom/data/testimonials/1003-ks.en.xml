    “Four decades of the free software movement have put us today in the position to
	widely deploy software that gives people rights with respect to the critical
	technology they rely on. The next 40 years is critical. I'm confident the diversity of
	voices and organizations working together will make it possible to achieve the hard
	work and vision of the movement's ideals, democratizing our technology and
	instituting ethical software for all of our essential infrastructure.”
