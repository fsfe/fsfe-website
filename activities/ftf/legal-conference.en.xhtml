        <h1>The Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop</h1>

    <p>

      The Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop is held every year to allow legal experts to discuss issues and best practices surrounding Free Software licenses. The Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop has become the world's premier event for debating, discussing and sharing knowledge around Free Software legal affairs. <br/>

      In 2015 the workshop will once again take place in Barcelona on April. Instead of rehashing familiar topics, we want to look at what problems we will likely encounter in the next five to ten years. Each day we will therefore have two topics to tickle your minds and spur interesting debate in the room as well as the hallway. As always, the workshop is under Chatham House Rule, to encourage an open and unencumbered debate.

    </p>

    <h3>Topics</h3>

    <p>
      This year we will cover the following interesting topics (and much more, since the specific agenda is still work in 
progress):
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Update from the trenches of Free Software:</strong><br/>
          Interesting updates on Free Software-related happenings around the world include new licenses, progress and challenges in software governance and license compliance tools, important cases relevant to licensing, legal issues the Free Software community faces, overviews of interesting happenings in South Korea and Taiwan.
       </li>

       <li><strong> Public procurement:</strong><br/>
           Free Software in public IT procurement has always been a hot topic on the Legal Network, and the Public Procurement SIG will present its newest findings at the workshop. We will look into commercial, IT and legal barriers for adopting Free Software in private and public sector and learn the first outcomes of FSFE's project to fix public procurement issues in Finland.
       </li>

      <li><strong>Software patents:</strong><br/>
		Defensive publications, patent pooling and updates from the latest EU an US case law. 
		</li>

        <li><strong>Non-traditional uses and issues of Free Software:</strong><br/>
            We will widen our perspective by looking at non-obvious uses of Free Software. This will include topics like Free Software in the automotive industry and issues with copyleft licenses in open hardware.
