<h1>European Parliament votes for Free Software in AI resolution – This 
position must now be included in the AI regulation</h1>

<p>Today the European Parliament passed a resolution on Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) with a huge majority of 495 votes in favor, 34 against 
and 102 abstentions. There are many references to the advantages of Free 
Software included in the text - the FSFE now urges the Parliament to 
transfer its own position into the AI regulation.
</p> 


<p>The resolution states that in public procurement Free Software 
should be mandated, where appropriate, with the goal to encourage cross 
border collaboration. The parliament also highlights the importance of 
Free Software as a way to enhance investments and boost innovation in 
AI technologies in the EU.

<blockquote><em>"We welcome the assessment and the demands of the 
European Parliament. With this resolution, the Parliament recognises 
the importance and relevance of Free Software for AI." explains Lina 
Ceballos, FSFE Project Manager.</em></blockquote>
 
<p>The FSFE demands with its "Public Money? Public Code!" Initiative 
that publicly financed software made publicly available under a Free 
Software licence. It is also important to rely on Free Software in AI 
as it helps to foster innovation, boosts local economy, ensures 
transparency and thus helps to protect fundamental rights.
</p>

<blockquote><em>“We ask Members of the European Parliament to take into 
account their position they voted on today and make sure this important 
position on Free Software and AI will be also included in regulation.” 
demands Alexander Sander, FSFE Policy Consultant.</em></blockquote>

<p>In the upcoming weeks the European Parliament will get closer to its 
position on the AI regulation, until end of May members can table 
amendments to the commission text from which the position of the 
Parliament is formed. The FSFE recently <a href="/news/2022/news-20220330-01.html">shared a dedicated 
document for decision-makers</a>, with elaborated arguments on the use 
of Free Software in AI technologies, which highlights the benefits that 
Free Software can offer to this crucial regulation.
