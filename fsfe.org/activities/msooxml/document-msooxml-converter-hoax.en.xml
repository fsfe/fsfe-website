    <title>The converter hoax</title>
    <description>
    FSFE Guest Commentary on Heise.de: "Conversion between Microsoft's Office
    OpenXML (MS-OOXML) and the vendor-independent Open Document Format (ODF)
    has been proposed by Microsoft and its associates as a solution to the
    problems caused by Microsoft's efforts to push a format into the market
    that conflicts with the existing Open Standard. [...] If these converters
    were actually able to do what they promise to do, they would be
    unnecessary."
