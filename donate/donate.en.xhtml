      <div id="introduction">
          <p>
        The Free Software Foundation Europe is a non-profit non-governmental
        organisation. <a href="/work.html">Our work</a> is made
        possible by a community of
        <a href="/contribute/contribute.html">volunteers</a>,
        <a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org">Fellows</a> and
        <a href="thankgnus.html">donors</a>. Your donations are critical to our
        strength and autonomy. They enable us to continue working for Free
        Software wherever necessary, and to be an independent voice.
      </p>

    <h2>Ways of donating</h2>

    <h3>Joining the organisation</h3>
    <p>
      The recommended way for donating to us is to join. You can decide
      on if you want to pay 10 Euro or more monthly, or 60 Euro or more yearly.

    </p>

    <h3>Making a one-time donation</h3>
    <p>
      In case you just want to make a single payment with any amount of
      your choice, this is the right option for you.

    </p>

    <h3>Other options</h3>

    <p>
      If none of these options fits your needs, please
      <a href="mailto:office@fsfe.org">contact us</a> and we will discuss
      the possibilities with you. You can find our
        <a href="/donate/thankgnus.html">list of donors</a> to see who else
      is supporting us, and you can also read about our different
      donation levels there.
    </p>

    <h2>What happens next</h2>

    <p>
      If you donate more than 480 Euro in a year, we would like to add your
      name to our <a href="thankgnus.html">donors list</a>. You can
      also remain anonymous.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, you can include our
      <a href="/about/graphics/sponsoring/sponsoring.html">Sponsoring buttons</a>
      on your own web page to show your support for us.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tax-deduction">Tax deduction</h2>

    <p>
      In some countries, donations to us can be deducted from income tax.
      Currently, this is the case in <a href="germany.html">Germany</a>, the
      <a href="netherlands.html">Netherlands</a>, and
      <a href="switzerland.html">Switzerland</a>. A donation receipt
      is generally sent in the beginning of the year for donations
      received the previous year.
