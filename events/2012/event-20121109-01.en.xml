      <p>FSFE will organise the "General Purpose Computing" track. Despite the fact that computers and - more and more - portable devices are universal machines, todays hardware often comes with anti-features or Digital Restrictions Management. This track by the FSFE will focus on this ongoing and increasing process of users restrictions. Thereby it concentrates on current trends and what we are in need of to stop them.</p>
