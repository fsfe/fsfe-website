<p>Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to

understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other
fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.</p>

<p>The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free
Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination.

in Europe.</p>
