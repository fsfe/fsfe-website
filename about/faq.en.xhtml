<h2>Frequently Answered Questions (FAQ)</h2>
</center>

<ul>

<li><a name="associatemembership"></a><b>Q: Why don't you have an
"associate membership" like the FSF North America?</b><p>A: The FSF
Europe has considered this in the past - in fact we have been
receiving requests for something like this as early as 2001. We did
consider it, but have decided against it for the FSF
Europe.</p><p>Our main reason for deciding against it was that we
felt it was problematic to call normal donors "members" if they don't
get the right to vote. This is not so unusual in the United States,
especially for U.S. book clubs and such, but for a European
organization working in the political field it didn't seem
fitting.</p><p>We are thinking about other possible alternatives to
give people some goodies for supporting the FSF Europe,
though.</p><p>The <a href="/about/graphics/sponsoring/">sponsoring
buttons</a> were a first step, but there will be more.</p></li>

<li><a name="who"></a><b>Q: Who are the members of the FSF
Europe?</b><p>A: People from different European countries, usually with a
long history in Free Software. A list of members is available <a
href="members.html">here</a>.</p></li>

<li><a name="volunteers"></a><b>Q: Someone claimed to be working for
you, is this true?</b><p>A: We have many people who work with and for
us on a regular basis, so even if you get contacted by someone with an
email address that does not seem related, this person may be working
in our name. Chances are you will find that person on our list of <a
href="volunteers.html">Permanent Volunteers</a>. Otherwise please <a
href="/contact/contact.html">ask us</a> if you want to be
sure.</p></li>

<li><a name="legal"></a><b>Q: What is your legal status/structure?</b><p>A:
As Europe is still quite a ways from being legally united, a modular
solution had to be found. You can find more information <a
href="/about/legal/">here</a>.</p></li>

<li><a name="graphics"></a><b>Q: Where do I find the FSF Europe Logo
   and other Artworks?</b><p>A: They are online <a
   href="graphics/graphics.html">here</a>.</p></li>
