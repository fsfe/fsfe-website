	    Ciaran O'Riordan will present, and will take questions on,
	    the main changes being made for version three of the GNU
	    GPL.  The goal of this evening is to give members of the
	    Free Software community information to help them make
	    constructive criticism and to suggest improvements during
	    the remainder of the year-long public consultation
	    process.
