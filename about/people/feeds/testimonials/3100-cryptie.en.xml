      I am Cryptie, I am living in Paris, France. I used to be a cryptographer
      and now I am a privacy specialist. I consciously use Free Software for 15
      years now. I discovered the FSFE randomly, I found the FSFE website and
      just loved this idea of counter-lobbying. I am a supporter of the FSFE
      for already 6 years now.
