		<h1>[Blog] We're all Gmail users now: Privacy as an ecological issue</h1>

		<p newsteaser="yes">Even if you're not using Google's
		Gmail service yourself, many of your friends
		will. How well can we really protect our privacy when
		we opt out of centralised web services? </p>

		<p>Based on analysis by Benjamin Mako Hill, I have
		explored this question in a couple of blog posts in
		English and German. The upshot: Privacy is an
		ecological question, just like breathable air and
		clean water.</p>
