<h2 id="eu-jeopardises-its-goals-in-standardisation-with-frand-licensing">EU 
jeopardises its goals in standardisation with FRAND licensing</h2>

<p>As a part of the Digital Single Market strategy, the European Commission 
has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-ict-standardisation-priorities-digital-single-market">published 
the communication on ICT standardisation  priorities</a> as one of the 
key factors in the digital economy. FSFE welcomes the overall approach 
taken in the communication in favour of more open standards and a greater 
inclusion of Free Software communities into standardisation processes.</p>

<p>However, the document lacks proper understanding of licensing conditions 
of standard-essential patents in order to include Free Software into 
standard setting processes. In particular, FSFE <a href="/news/2016/news-20160428-02">expresses 
its concerns in regard to the promotion of so-called "fair, reasonable, 
and non-discriminatory (FRAND) licensing terms</a> that in practice are 
incompatible with Free Software. This way, the document jeopardises every 
effort set by the European Commission to integrate Free Software communities 
into standardisation.</p>

<h2 id="european-commission-vs-google-android">European Commission vs Google Android</h2>

<p>On April 20, the European Commission 
<a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-16-1506_en.htm?locale=en">outlined 
its charges in regard to Google's business practices relating to the 
Android operating system</a>. According to the Commission, Google is 
abusing its dominant market position by pre-installing and setting Google 
Search, Google Play Store and Google Chrome as the default on most Android 
devices sold in Europe. These practices close off ways for competitive 
search engines to access the market.</p>

<p>FSFE has previously <a href="/news/2013/news-20130729-02.html">raised 
its concerns in regard to the claim against the free-of-charge distribution
of Android</a> that had been raised to the European Commission by a 
coalition of certain online service providers who claimed that this practice 
is harmful to competition. We argued against that claim as it undermines 
the whole essence of Free Software licensing, and are pleased to see that 
the Commission disregarded that claim in its antitrust case against Google.</p>

<h2 id="what-else-have-we-done">What else have we done?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>We ran the eighth annual election for a Fellowship 
representative who is to represent our community and the FSFE's Fellowship 
in <a href="/about/team.html#general-assembly">FSFE's 
general assembly</a>. Although we only had one candidate, we would like to 
<a href="/news/2016/news-20160502-01">thank 
and congratulate Mirko Boehm to run for the office and being elected</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>We now have over 30 organisations and companies who joined us in 
proposing measures to EU institutions and EU member states to avoid negative 
implications on users' rights and Free Software imposed by the 
<a href="/activities/radiodirective/statement">EU 
Radio Equipment Directive 2014/53/EU, aka 'Radio Lockdown Directive'</a>. 
The joint statement is open to new signatures against negative implications 
that the 'Radio Lockdown Directive' poses on software freedom, users' 
rights, fair competition, innovation, environment, and volunteering.</p></li>

<li><p>FSFE also joined a coalition of organisations that fight the 
negative implementations of the 'Radio Lockdown Directive' in France. 
Together, we signed <a href="/news/2016/news-20160406">an 
open letter to the French government and French Telecommunications Regulatory 
Authority (ART)</a> to ensure that the implementation of the 'Radio Lockdown 
Directive' in France will not harm Free Software.</p></li>

<li><p>On our way to become more transparent and inclusive, we published 
our <a href="/about/transparency-commitment">transparency 
commitment</a> in line with the guidelines from Transparency International Germany.</p></li>

<li><p>A lot of our initial structure and founding documents have not 
been updated ever since the FSFE grew from being a small circle of volunteers 
into an organisation with hired staff, with a Fellowship program and a 
community of thousands of people. We now begun to <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/jonas/?p=60">revise 
our "Self Conception"</a>, to better reflect our grown decision-making process. 
Jonas Öberg, FSFE's executive director, shared his thoughts on and insights 
about <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/jonas/?p=50">potential future steps 
to FSFE's structure and membership</a> on his blog.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/jonas/?p=65">On the backend of our 
work, we have introduced a ticket system built on OTRS</a>. Although at 
first sight not many people seem to be directly affected by this, our whole 
communication will profit over time from higher control of our workflow. 
Also, it shall be opened to be used by volunteers as well.</p></li>

<li><p>From 13 - 15 April, FSFE's annual legal licensing workshop LLW 
took place in Barcelona, Spain. The event is dedicated to gather legal 
practitioners from all over the world to dicuss the most challenging issues 
in and around Free Software licensing. This year it had a record number 
of participants, showing the increasing interest and importance of Free 
Software in software licensing.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="take-action">Take Action</h2>

<p>From 2 - 4 September, 2016, the first summit of FSFE will take place, 
an event dedicated to our community. To make it a unique and appealing 
experience for everyone, we sent out a <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/Summit2016/CallForParticipation">Call 
for Participation</a> last week to all our Fellows and on our mailing lists. 
Take your chance and be part of FSFE's main event in 2016 by becoming a 
speaker or a volunteer, by hosting a workshop or another event.</p>

<h2 id="good-free-software-news">Good Free Software news</h2>

<p>Spain's Ministry of Finance and Public Administrations <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/spain-publishes-file-archive-tool-open-source">published 
its web-based solution for archiving electronic files under a Free Software 
license</a>. France is also not lagging behind and recently 
<a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/france-unveils-source-code-income-tax-application">published 
the source code of the fiscal calculator used by the French fiscal 
administration to calculate the income taxes of individuals in France</a>. 
This was an outcome of the legal case in Paris' administrative court that 
concluded that a source code of a software written by and for public 
authorities can be considered as a public information that can be freely 
accessed.</p>
