<h1>FSFE is hiring a working student specialised on websites</h1>

<p>
  We are looking for a working student to support our work to empower people to
  control technology. The person will work 10-15 hours per week and will
  maintain and improve the FSFE's websites. Applicants have to be enrolled in a
  German university and can work remotely.
</p>

<h2>About the FSFE</h2>

<p>
  Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to control
  technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives and it is
  important that technology empowers rather than restricts us. Free Software
  gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt, and share software.
  These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech,
  press, and privacy.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free Software
  contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination. It enhances
  users' rights by abolishing barriers to Free Software adoption, encourages
  people to use and develop Free Software, and provides resources to enable
  everyone to further promote Free Software in Europe.
</p>

<p>
  We are involved in <a href="/activities/">many activities</a> in the legal,
  economic, political and technical areas around Free Software. Our work is made
  possible by a community of volunteers, supporters, donors, and staff. The web
  working student's job will strengthen the public perception of the FSFE and
  allow more people to work effectively with the web presences.

  and separate activity-related websites like <a
  href="https://git.fsfe.org/pmpc/website">publiccode.eu</a>.</li>
  <li>Helping volunteers and staff with problems when working with the website,
  and finding solutions to lower the technical threshold, for example when
  working with Git or other tools used in the process.</li>
  <li>Assisting in major overhauls of existing websites (like design,
  restructuring, or website generator) and the development of new web
  projects.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="attitude">Attitude</h2>

<p>
  We are looking for a reliable, well-organised member of our technical teams
  who is keen to learn about old and new technologies. You support the whole
  organisation in its mission. Long-term thinking, efficiency and effectiveness
  are more important to you than the newest cool technology on the block.
</p>

<p>
  When people have technical questions, you can support them and also have
  interest in explaining them the underlying technology in an adequate language.
</p>

<h2 id="details">Working time and compensation</h2>

<p>
  The desired working time is 10-15 hours per week but can be discussed. You can
  work from anywhere in Germany, but should be willing to travel 1-2 times a
  year to staff and web-team meetings. The salary is based on the currently
  applicable minimum wage in Germany but can be higher depending on your
  experience. A mandatory requirement due to administrative reasons is that you
  are enrolled as a student at a university in Germany, and have a working
  permit for Germany, for example by EU citizenship.
</p>

<h2 id="apply">How to apply</h2>

<p>
  To apply, please send a maximum one-page cover letter -- including the desired
  hours per week -- and a maximum two-page CV (only PDFs are accepted) by email
  to jobs@fsfe.org, with the subject "website student" and your name. Please do
  not include pictures of yourself in the application.
</p>

<p>
  Your personal data will be deleted 3 months after we have made our decision.
  The closing date for applications is <em>Sunday 31 December 2021</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Free Software is meant to serve everyone regardless of their age, ability or
  disability, gender identity, sex, race, nationality, religion or sexual
  orientation. Hence, we encourage applications from all backgrounds and promise
  to judge all applications on merit, without reference to any of the
  characteristics listed. To promote diversity and equality in the Free Software
  community, we shall give preference to applicants who identify as part of a
  traditionally marginalised demographic in technology for applications of equal
  strength.
