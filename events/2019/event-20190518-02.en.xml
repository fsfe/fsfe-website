    <title>Managing Jails with Ansible - BSDCan 2019 in Ottawa, Canada</title>

    <body>
      <p> Nowadays container technologies such as Docker are the first thing you hear about when talking about how to deploy and manage (micro) services. While an operating system like FreeBSD already has a number of features available out of the box that can be used to implement many desired characteristics, there is nonetheless still a need to write code that can integrate all this into a complete package.</p>
<p> With this talk, FSFE Member Albert Dengg will show how to host multiple-managed, and partly customized applications, for numerous distinct user groups, with minimal overhead for managing updates and setup of new instances.</p>
