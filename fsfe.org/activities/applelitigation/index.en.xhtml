  <h1>DMA: Apple Litigation</h1>

  <div>

    <div id="introduction">
      <p>
        The FSFE is intervening for Free Software in a key court case involving Apple and the European Commission.
        Apple is trying to avoid obligations derived from the Digital Markets Act (DMA).
        The FSFE seeks to hold Apple accountable under the DMA in a developer-friendly way.

    <h2>Apple’s unbalanced power is a threat to Free Software</h2>

    <p>Apple is one of the largest tech companies in the world. Its 
    unbalanced power spans over key aspects of software and devices, 
    profoundly distorting digital markets. Apple’s dominance negatively 
    affects not only competition among other companies, but software 
    freedom, open internet and ultimately digital democracy.</p> 

    <p>The Digital Markets Act (DMA) is the European Union’s regulatory 
    response to such corporate power. The law applies to very large 
    companies exercising “gatekeeper control” in the EU. The DMA imposes 
    on such companies several obligations, like the right to install and 
    uninstall software in devices, prohibitions to non-removable 
    pre-installed software, enabling third-party app stores and access 
    rights via interoperability with software and hardware functions.</p>

    <p>In September 2023, the European Commission designated Apple as 
    “gatekeeper” under the DMA. With that, the law began to apply on 
    Apple’s operating system, app store and browser. However, Apple has 
    taken an aggressive position against the DMA starting litigation 
    against the European Commission in November, 2023.</p>

    <p>>Due to the high risks against Software Freedom involved in this 
    case, in February 2024, the FSFE decided to intervene to hold Apple 
    accountable under the DMA in a developer-friendly way.</p>

      <figcaption>Barriers against software freedom and vendor lock-in are constant hurdles faced by developers and users interacting with Apple</figcaption>

    <h2>Safeguarding the interests of Free Software developers and users</h2>

    <p>Apple, in this case (T-1080/23), is trying to dodge the DMA rules over its app store and interoperability of its operating system. The company’s narrow interpretation of the DMA frames these obligations as disproportionate in relation to its commercial and economic interests.</p> 
    
    <p>The FSFE is countering this position by proving that Apple is being regulated in the light of public interest. We assert that Apple should compete on trustworthiness. Developers and users should benefit from alternative services and products, not just those offered by Apple. For reasons of fair competition, cybersecurity and consumer protection we claim the case be dismissed completely. </p>

    <p>Here is how your rights are affected:</p>

    <div>
      <p><strong>As a developer:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access rights:</strong> Software developers will enjoy less restrictive barriers to access and distribute their software in enviroments controlled by Apple;</li>
        <li><strong>More software freedom:</strong> Software developers will be able to demand from Apple rights allowing the installation of third party apps (sideloading), the use of third party app stores, the uninstallation of pre-installed software in devices;</li> 
        <li><strong>Better interoperability policies:</strong> Software developers will be able to demand effective and free-of-charge interoperability between their software with Apple’s software and hardware controlled by Apple’s operating system.</li>
      </ul>
    </div> 
  
    <div>
      <p><strong>As a user:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enhanced freedom of choice:</strong> Users will enjoy more freedom of choice regarding software on Apple devices. Users will benefit from more competition and offers from third-party providers, including alternative app-stores, features and solutions.</li>
      </ul>
