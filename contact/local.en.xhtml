    <p>
      If there is no FSFE team in your country yet, you can start one.  This
      way, you can work for Free Software more effectively.  FSFE's other
      volunteers can provide you with help and advice, and you will have the
      established FSFE brand to work under.  At a minimum, FSFE can provide
      basic infrastructure such as public and private mailing lists.  More
      importantly, we can quickly connect you with a Europe-wide network of
      experienced Free Software advocates.  It is not necessary to set up a
      formal legal structure to form a country team.
