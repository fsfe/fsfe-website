		<div id="introduction">

			<p>On this page, you find an overview of FSFE's promotion material for various usage. You might either order our default promotion package or use the comment field to explain what kind of material you especially would like to receive. Material and shipping is for free, please find more details below.</p>
		
		</div>

		<h2 id="id-why-and-when-to-order">Why and when to order</h2>

		<p>There are various reasons why and when you should receive promotion
 material from the FSFE. Maybe you know a location (e.g. a Hackerspace, a youth club, your office...) where you would love to see advertisement for FSFE. Or you would like to tell your friends and colleagues about FSFE and what we are doing. Or you are even planning a public activity to promote FSFE and our work. These are just some examples for the usage of our promotion material. Please, feel free to decide for yourself when, why and for what you would like to use it. </p>

		<h2 id="id-how-and-what-to-order">How and what to order</h2>

		<p>To order promotion material please use the following order form. You might either 
order our default package or tell us explicitly what kind of promotion 
material you need or prefer. For example, if you plan to support a 
special FSFE`s campaign. Please keep in mind, that for postal reasons, 
in general we just send packages up to 1kg. If you need more, please ask.</p>

		<div class="left break margin-vertical">

			<img class="left grid-30" src="promotion/joinfellowship-poster_thumb.png" />

			<p class="right grid-70">Our <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/join">"Join the Fellowship"</a> <strong>poster</strong>. A good 
poster to pin on a prominent place, for example inside a meeting room or a Hackerspace
and for use at any public activity. Available in size A1.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="left break margin-vertical">

			<img class="left grid-30" src="promotion/folder-fsfe-en1_thumb.png" />

			<p class="right grid-70">Our FSFE <strong>folder</strong>. 
On the inside of these folders, there is written some core information about FSFE, Free Software and how to contribute. They are available in an English and a German version. These folders are made to handle additional paper with more information inside, they are available in size A4 and in size A5. Inside of the latter, we normally put our Fellowship leaflets (see next item), as they are size A5, too. The others, namely those in size A4, we normally spread with printed versions of our <a href="https://fsfe.org/about/printable/">political leaflets</a>. But they are also very useful in other contexts, for example spreading informations to the attendees of a conference.</p>

		</div>


		<div class="left break margin-vertical">

			<img class="left grid-30" src="promotion/fellowship-leaflet-thumb.png" />

			<p class="right grid-70">Our Fellowship <strong>leaflets</strong>. These leaflets are in size A5, so they fit perfectly into our FSFE folder (see item above). It is a nice piece of a graphical artwork, explaining why someone should think about becoming a fellow. The print is double sided: One side is in English, the other one in German. </p>

		</div>

		<div class="left break margin-vertical">

			<img class="left grid-30" src="promotion/freiheit-thumb.png" />

			<p class="right grid-70">This <strong>flyer</strong> is about Free Software and the GNU project and compares Free Software to the use of screws and screwdrivers. On the last page then, it promotes Richard Stallman and the FSFE and the Fellowship of the FSFE. Attention: This flyer is only available in German right now but is in progress of translation and production for other languages, too.</p>

		</div>



		<div class="left break margin-vertical">

			<img class="left grid-30" src="promotion/plussy-sticker-thumb.png" />

			<p class="right grid-70">The classic Plussy <strong>stickers</strong>, the symbol of FSFE`s Fellowship. The background is transparent, so the sticker integrates perfectly in any sourrounding - not just on laptops. Size: 7 x 7cm.</p>

		</div>


		<h3 id="id-free-your-android-campaign" class="left break">"Free Your Android" campaign</h3>

		<div class="left break margin-vertical">

			<img class="left grid-30" src="promotion/fya-poster_thumb.png" />

			<p class="right grid-70">This is the <strong>poster</strong> of our <a href="http://www.freeyourandroid.org">"Free Your Android" campaign</a> for which there are flyers available, too. So far, experience shows that this poster is very eye catchy and attracts a lot of people to ask about the backgrounds of this campaign. Hence, we recommend to use it at any booth. Size A1.</p>

		</div>


		<div class="left break margin-vertical">

			<img class="left grid-30" src="promotion/fya-flyer-en_thumb.png" />

			<p class="right grid-70">This is the <strong>flyer</strong> of our <a href="http://www.freeyourandroid.org/">"Free Your Android" campaign</a>
 for which are posters available, too. They are in size A7, that 
makes them very easy to spread and for interested persons very easy to 
put in pocket or their moneybag. The print is double sided: One side is 
in English, the other one in German.</p>

		</div>

		<h3 id="id-pdfreaders-campaign" class="left break">"PDFreaders" campaign</h3>
		
		<div class="left break margin-vertical">

			<img class="left grid-30" src="promotion/pdfreaders-poster_thumb.png" />

			<p class="right grid-70">This is the <strong>poster</strong> of our <a href="http://www.pdfreaders.org/">PDFreaders campaign</a>. The poster is plain, so you have to fill out the <a href="http://fsfe.org/campaigns/pdfreaders/petition.en.html">actual numbers of organisations and individuals signing our petition</a> by yourself. This is long lasting campaign now, still people like it very much. Size A1.</p>

		</div>

		<h3 id="id-document-freedom-day-campaign" class="left break">"Document Freedom Day" campaign</h3>
		
		<div class="left break margin-vertical">

			<img class="left grid-30" src="promotion/icryd-sticker_thumb.png" />

			<p class="right grid-70"> The "I cannot read your documents" <strong>stickers</strong> address our <a href="http://www.documentfreedom.org/">Document Freedom Day campaign</a>. The slogan highlights the problem in the use of proprietary file formats, as they exclude all people not using the same proprietary software from reading the document. Size: 7,5 x 7,5cm.</p>
