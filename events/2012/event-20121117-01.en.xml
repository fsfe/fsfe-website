   <title>FSFE at JDLL in Lyon, France</title>
   <body>
     <p>
   In November, FSFE will be present at the French event
   <a href="http://2012.jdll.org">JDLL</a> in Lyon, France.
   Every year, this event regroups organisations advocating Free Software and
   people giving talks over a complete week end in the center of Lyon. We'll be
   there the entire time from the 17th to the 18th. One of our interns, LÃ©opold
   Baillard, will even be there the whole week if you want to meet with him.
   He will also give a talk about the Free Your Android campaign. The event takes
   place in <a href="http://www.salledesrancy.com/">Maison pour Tous - Salle des
   Rancy</a>. We are looking forward to see you there!
