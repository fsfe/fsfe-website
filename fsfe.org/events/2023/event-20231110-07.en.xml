        <title>SFSCON '23 - Ada &amp; Zangemann book reading in English in Bolzano, Italy</title>

    <body>
      <p>The first day of SFSCON will close with the reading of the book 'Ada &amp; Zangemann: a Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream' by Matthias Kirchsner.</p>
      <p>The famous inventor Zangemann lives in a huge villa high above the city, constantly building and programming cool gadgets that everyone can’t wait to buy. But one day on a walk through town, something happens that changes the way he sees his own inventions—young people are using them in fun ways, and that make him furious.<br/>
