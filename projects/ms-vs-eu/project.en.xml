    <title>Microsoft versus European Union citizens</title>
    <description>
     In 2001 the European Union, through its Antitrust FIXME of the
     European Commission (lead by prof. Monti), started investigating
     on Microsoft dominant position in the desktop operating systems.
     The Free Software Foundation Europe was invited from the
     EC to represent the stances of Free Software movement.  In 2004
     FSFE is trying to participate to the appeal to defend again free
     competition and freedom of choice against abuses.
