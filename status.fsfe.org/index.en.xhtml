                <dd class="description">Delivery of e-mails on our mailing lists is delayed. The issue could be pined to AI training harvester crawlers that crawled our public mailing list archives. For a while, the delay went down from several days to around 2 hours, but it is back up to around 2 days.<br />
                    Mails that are sent to the mailinglists are being processed and will be delivered and are not lost. So please do not re-send e-mails.<br />
                    Emails directed to personal email addresses continue to work normally.<br />
                    The exact issue in our setup causing the delay is still under investigation, but we are now moving the setup to a different server to rule out several issues at once. Copying data to the new server is taking longer than expected, so we
                    currently cannot provide an exact time frame for the fix, but we will continue to
                    work on it and we will update you here.<br />
                    Expected downtime of the mailinglist server on 2025-01-22 from 20:hh.</dd>
