  <h2 class="painted">The - not only - environmental costs behind our smartphones</h2>

    <p>Smartphones are very valuable devices. Not only for our personal communication and organisation, but also in terms of the natural resources and energy investments necessary to produce them. Rare earths and other limited resources are required to produce many of the technical modules and chips that any smartphone consists of. Even worse: many of such resources are not only extremely rare and their extraction causes great environmental damage through mining, for example. Very often they are also extracted from the ground under inhumane conditions including child labor and different forms of slavery. In so called failed states and in the absence of law and order, a battle for the best mines often leads to local fights and violence.</p>

    <p>After extraction, these resources are send to manufacturies in South- and East-Asia where in a very energy-intensive process they are used to produce all the chips and connectors no smartphone can be used without. Assembling these modules often happens under conditions that are in our European understanding inacceptable. The energy invested is for the most part deriving from fossil fuels, disposal of waste produced during the production happens with less attention towards their environmental impact as regulations we know from European policies.</p>

    <p>After production, these devices are send around the world to end up in stores and inboxes of customers. The global transportation of these products again have a huge environmental impact. Apple for example, <a href="">calculates its carbon footprint for 2018</a> to derive in 74% from the production of and another 5% of global transport of their products. Learn more about <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html#free-software-sustainability-and-the-use-of-natural-resources">Hardware production and usage times</a> in our article. </p>

    <p>After their usage lifetime, the disposal of smartphone devices is
    equally troubling. In particular the amount of e-waste increases every year. The
    <a href="http://ewastemonitor.info/">global e-waste monitor calculates</a> that
    in 2019 alone over 50 million tons of electronic waste have
    globally been disposed. Since 2014, the amount of annual
    electronic waste has increased by more than a fifth. In turn, only
    17% of this was recycled. Most of the scrap
    - including large parts of the recycling - ends up in the countries
    of the global south. Again, global transportation of e-waste comes with additional environmental costs, and once arrived, it is thinned through under inhumane conditions and searched for the last usable raw materials.</p>

  <h2 class="painted">Problem: Short life time of devices</h2>

    <p>We can help the aforementioned problems by reducing the amount of Smarphones being produced. In the last five years there have been sold (thus also produced) <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/755388/global-smartphone-unit-sales-by-region/">more than 1.5 billion smartphones</a> every year. Every time we keep using our current smartphone instead of buying a new one we help avoiding the production of new phones and disposal of ewaste. Assuming if only one third of smartphone users would use their devices one year longer as now, this would reduce the production of new smartphones already by hundreds of millions of smartphones yearly and thus reduce the involved energy consumption significantly.</p>

    <p>But keep using our phones in use is sometimes not just a question of will. Often manufacturers prefer if we buy them new phones instead of keep using our current ones. Non-repairability of devices, missing spare parts and other hardware-related obstacles come into mind, that often hinder users from keep using their devices once even only a minor part of the whole device is broken. However, software play an equally important part regarding the life-time of smart devices.</p>

    <p></p>

  <h3>software obsolescence</h3>

  <p>one of the most common cases is the third case from the list above: the end of the provision of software or the end of support for software. As a rule, such a linear business model is the basis of the market logic of proprietary software: the sale of new products should be promoted by devaluing current products11. The software of a certain version (in the above example, the operating system X) is no longer supported, so that customers are forced to buy the next higher version. </p>

  <p>the forced version upgrade can lead to the devaluation of hardware that is actually still functioning. This is the case when the next version can no longer be run on the old hardware. Ultimately, users are faced with a dilemma: Either they continue to use their current and functioning hardware, but have to live with a security risk by continuing to use the old software without any further security updates. Or they are forced to buy new hardware just to use the new software upgrade. This dilemma is known as "software obsolescence" </p>

    Most of the smartphones affected by software obsolescence are devices with the Android operating system from Google. In fairness, this is simply due to the fact that an estimated 75% of smartphones worldwide have Android installed. On the other hand, it is also attributed to the fact that the actual hardware is mostly produced by third-party manufacturers and the operating system itself is in turn developed by Google. As a result of the initial sale, however, the hardware manufacturers have no further incentives to ensure that the phone can be used for as long as possible. On the contrary, you can always rely on new Android versions by a third party – Google – to keep producing and marketing new phones - instead of providing support for previous Android versions.

    <p>Free Software solves the dilemma of software obsolescence in that there cannot be a forced end of support. Instead, Free Software can be used by all people for unlimited time and space and no single entity has full control over the software. Read more about <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">software sustainability</a> in our article. On your Android phone you can replace the operating system with a Free Software operating system. These are called "Custom ROM".</p>

  <h2 class="">Free Software as a sustainable solution out of the dilemma</h2>

    <p>On Android phones the aforementioned “custom ROMs” can be installed on the said smartphones. These custom ROMs are modifications and Free Software operating systems of the original Android operating system, which enable users to install "new operating systems" on "old hardware". This means, that in many cases at least the current operating version can be supplied with security updates, and sometimes porting to higher operating system versions may also be possible. The users are thus no longer at the mercy of the dilemma of software obsolescence described above and the lifetime of the respective hardware can thus be significantly increased18.</p>

    <p>By extending the usage time of hardware and countering software obsolescence, Free Software can directly help save natural resources and, attain sustainable digitization. </p>

  <h2>Join the movement and be part of it</h2>

    <p>Join our initiative and upcycle your smartphone. Together we can make a difference and help to reduce our resource consumption. Unfortunately, installing alternative Free Software operating systems on Android phones is not always easy. To help you with it we <a href="">collected the most important information</a> with links for further reading as well as we offer workshops for user where they can find help.</p>

    <p>Please also help by letting other people know about this initiative. Point them to our <a href="">home page</a>, order some <a href="">stickers</a> or join our mailing list. Check out our <a href="">workshops</a> if you like to participate with your phone or as a volunteer to helpe others. Share our video etc., also embed this video here. </p>
