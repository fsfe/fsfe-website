      <p>
      On Thursday June 7, 2007 at 3:30 pm in the V G Kulkarni Auditorium at
      Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE) in Mumbai, India, Georg
      Greve gives a talk about Free Software and science.<br/>

      Free Software and science share common roots, and benefit society in
      several similar ways. In his talk, Mr Greve will explain the concept of
      Free Software and how it relates to maintaining our scientific basis as a
      society. As a practical example of this collaboration, the talk will give
      a brief introduction of the Science, Education and Learning in Freedom
      project, in which the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, Tata
      Institute of Fundamental Research plays a crucial role.  The talk will
      close with an overview of how all of this relates to the global political
      trends of knowledge monopolisation, and the Access to Knowledge
      initiative.
