<h1>EU Parliament intends to widen participation in the Interoperable Europe Board</h1>

<p>Today the EU Parliament’s Committee responsible for the 
Interoperable Europe Act has adopted its final position. It is a step 
forward towards a more inclusive Interoperable Europe Board while it 
introduces clearer indicators and statistics to monitor the progress of 
the Act. This position must now be upheld during the upcoming 
trilogue.</p>

<p>Today the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) has 
voted on its final text of the Interoperable Europe Act which is an 
improvement of the Commission proposal. The EU Parliament has 
introduced the possibility for relevant stakeholders to participate 
with observer status in the Interoperable Europe Board meetings and 
activities, including within those, the Free Software community.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a href="/news/2023/news-20230323-02.html">the EU Parliament has also followed our demand</a> 
suggesting the introduction of clearer objectives and statistics, that will allow to 
evaluate and properly measure the progress of the activities that will 
fall under this Act. Especially, when it comes to monitoring the use 
and uptake of Free Software solutions among public administrations.</p>

<blockquote>
<italic>“The inclusion of relevant stakeholders and experts, such as the Free 
 Software community, in the Interoperable Europe Board must be part of 
 the final text of the Interoperable Europe Act. Likewise, proper 
 monitoring and evaluation procedures need to be set up to improve and 
 adapt the interoperability of Europe in the long run. We, therefore, 
 call upon the EU Parliament, especially the rapporteur Ivars Ijabs, to 
 safeguard its position during the upcoming trilogue and to not allow 
 any backwards step”</italic>, <em> mentions Lina Ceballos, FSFE Policy Project 
 Manager.</em>
</blockquote>


<p>The ITRE Committee has also voted with a large majority to enter the 
inter-institutional negotiations. This means that the European 
Parliament must now defend its position and anchor it to the final text 
which will be negotiated together with the Council and Commission in 
the coming weeks. This is of high importance bearing in mind that <a href="/news/2023/news-20230623-01.html">the 
latest compromise text of the Council is hindering the inclusion of 
relevant stakeholders</a> in the governance structure of this Act.
