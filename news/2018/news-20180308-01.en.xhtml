      <p>Developers Italia celebrating I Love Free Software Day</p>
    </footer>
  </div>

  <p>On Wednesday 14th of February, our community celebrated the
    annual "<a href="https://ilovefs.org">I love Free Software Day</a>". A day to declare love to the communities
    most important to you as well as saying "Thank You" to the Free Software
    projects surrounding us every single day. The Free Software Foundation Europe
    also wants to thank everyone who cheered and contributed to make this day as
    special as it could be.</p>

  <p>We counted hundreds of Tweets, Toots and Posts both on Twitter and the
    Fediverse as well as tens of blog posts, photos and artworks all showing love
    to the countless of people out there contributing to Free Software every day,
    be it in the form of code, translations, documentation, community work,
    designing or managing. Thank you very much to all of you amazing people!</p>
  
  <h2>First signs of love at FOSDEM</h2>

  <p><a href="/news/2017/news-20170315-01.html">Just like last year</a>, we
    already encountered lots of people eager to show love at FOSDEM. Besides the
    big projects such as GNOME, Debian, Firefox, Python, Linux or VLC, many also
    mentioned smaller or uncommon projects as well as general love for Free
    Software or values that can usually be found in Free Software Communities:
    "Openness", "Freedom", "Choice" or "self-determination" were terms we often
    heard. If you want to see more people expressing their love for Free
    Software, make sure to <a href="/activities/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.html">
    check out the full gallery</a>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The projects attending FOSDEM also had the chance to thank their communities
    for contributing, bugreporting and helping. Not only that, we were also able
    to bring several projects together to find the similarities (or differences)
    they appreciate and show their shared love of Free Software.</p>
  
  <h2>I Love Free Software Day</h2>

  </div>
  
  <p>When the day finally came, we received an overwhelming amount of messages
    from the community, expressing themselves, thanking their favorite projects
    and developers or advocating Free Software in general.</p>

  <p>In order to analyze the sheer amount of love messages and contributions
    coming in on I Love Free Software Day each year, we finally took a step up
    as well. Our current intern Jan wrote a Scraper in
    <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">GNU R</a> which helps us not to miss a
    single #ilovefs post and give every project the gratitude it deserves. Parts
    of it would not have been possible without the help of Vincent, our second
    intern. A cheer for collaboration and yet another proof that Free Software is
    awesome!</p>

  <p>Together on Twitter and the Fediverse, we counted exactly 439 "I Love Free
    Software" posts by 243 individual accounts containing the <em>#ilovefs</em>
    tag, mentioning 95 projects and developers. You can find a few visualizations
    showing the results of our collected data.</p>

  <p>The tools we wrote are Free as well and available for everyone to
    <a href="https://git.fsfe.org/janwey/ilfs-data">
    use, study, share and improve</a>! But it is not all stats and data. The
    important thing is behind all of the numbers: The message these people want
    to send out and the feeling of a community of people so diverse and yet like
    minded when it comes to values like openness, acceptance, empathy or
    acknowledgment of what we can create together.</p>

  <p>There are multiple examples of this, like the
    <a href="https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/866">
    amazing post on StreetComplete's issue-tracker by rugk</a>, where this user
    thanked the project and it's developer(s) in a lengthy text and received very
    nice feedback as well.
    <a href="https://www.schauenburg.nl/posts/2018/02/14-i-love-free-software-day-2018/">
    Sebastian Schauenburg's blog post</a> where he calls for even more sympathy
    and communication among developers and within the communities themselves. A
    few projects also published blog posts themselves, for example Nextcloud,
    showing us <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/valentines-day-we-love-free-software/">
    how the 4 Freedoms of Free Software made their very own existence
    possible</a>. Then there is some really good and creative artwork for example
    <a href="https://grisebouille.net/ilovefs/">by Grise Bouille</a> or
    <a href="https://twitter.com/developersITA/status/964060999899860992">

    showing how to express your love for Free Software</a> and many, many more
    that we are just not able to mention in this short report.</p>

  <h2>Save the date!</h2>

  <p>In case you missed your opportunity to thank your favourite project, mark
    February 14 as "I Love Free Software Day" in your calendar for next year. However,
    you shouldn't think it is the only day you are allowed to show your love. It's
    obvious we should show our appreciation and gratitude throughout the entire
    year â€“ there is simply no wrong time for that!</p>

  <p>We would like to thank everyone involved in and contributing to this day, as
    well as the countless developers, translators, community managers, artists
    and anyone involved in Free Software.</p>
