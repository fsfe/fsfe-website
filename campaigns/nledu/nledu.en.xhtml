    <div id="introduction">

      <p>We want to free access to education and the public sector at large,
      both online and offline, by pushing for a mandatory use of Open Standards
      and a guaranteed platform-independent access to all online environments.
      This allows students and parents to use Free Software, and in that way
      are able to tap into their potential for growth and personal development.
      </p>

    </div>

    <h2>What we want</h2>

    <ul>

    <li>to strengthen the Dutch action plan "Netherlands Open in Connection" by
    making the use of Open Standards truly mandatory for all publicly-funded
    institutions, in harmony with the comply-or-explain principle;</li>

    <li>to make platform-independent access to all online services and
    information mandatory for all publicly-funded institutions, in this case,
    educational institutions;</li>

    <li>to promote innovative education in IT-skills by broadening the
    educational program with broader vendor-independent skill-sets.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>The situation</h2>

    <p>Children should have free access to education. International law is
    clear on that.  As more and more education moves online it is paramount
    that this access is guaranteed by the use of Free Software. But not so in
    the Netherlands where some students are locked out of online school
    environments due to use of closed standards and proprietary webtechnology.
    They are forced to forego on free and innovative technology and purchase
    proprietary software just to be able to hand in their homework, receive
    assignments, cooperate on projects and pass exams.</p>
    
    <p>The Secretary of Education of the Netherlands, in response to
    Parliament, states she considers a low-cost multiyear vendor-lock
    acceptable, thus railroads the Dutch ambitious Open Standards policy
    framework and ignores the short-term and long-term consequences:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>the enforced purchase of proprietary computer technology just to be
      able to participate in education is illegal and unconstitutional;</li>

      <li>it allows educational institutions offer the large majority of
      students only limited, vendor-specific skillsets, with the support of a
      small number of commercial vendors of proprietary solutions;</li>

      <li>it reduces the innovative strength of the Dutch economy as the
      educational systems does not provide it with a sufficiently trained
      labour force;</li>

      <li>it forces Dutch companies, organizations and governments to spend
      billions of euro's each year on re-training, unnecessary and enforces
      upgrades on hardware and software and license fees.</li>
    
    </ul>
