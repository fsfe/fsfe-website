  Back in October the FSFE started the <a href="/activities/yh4f/index.html">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</a> 
  competition to inspire the younger generation into software freedom. 
  We had the pleasure to receive many interesting and inspired projects 
  from all around Europe. Over a hundred people coming from 25 
  countries registered for the competition, making it a truly 
  pan-European event. Now it is the exciting time of the results! The 
  winners receive a cash prize intended to help them further develop 
  their programs, or to support their studies. After careful 
  consideration and interviews, here are the six winners:

<h2 id="ultimate-hacker-award-stavros-for-signtrack">ü•áUltimate Hacker Award: Stavros for SignTrack</h2>

<p>
  Stavros, 17 year old student from Heraklion, a city in the Greek 
  island Crete, wins the first prize with a project that amazes both 
  for its execution and its idea. <a href="https://edugit.org/Piperakis/SignTrack">Signtrack</a> aims to 
  translate sign language to writing. It is a valuable technology for 
  people who use sign language to communicate fast with an audience who 
  do not know sign language. This might help them personally and 
  professionally. Here is what Stavros has to say for SignTrack.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>What does SignTrack do?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Stavros</strong>: SignTrack transcribes sign language to text 
  from a real-time video feed. The model makes predictions on what you 
  sign instantly. After completing your sentence, an additional 
  processing layer restructures your sentence to follow grammatical 
  rules, which are different in sign language. Creating a custom model 
  requires minimal coding skills. A graphical interface assists you 
  throughout data collection. And with the power of AutoTrain, training 
  your model does not require complex adjustments.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>How did you come up with the idea?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Stavros</strong>: Sign language classes in my school 
  highlighted the need for sign language recognition as an 
  accessibility feature. After realizing there was no easy-to-use Free 
  Software in that field, I decided to develop SignTrack.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>What was your experience of the competition?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Stavros</strong>: The YH4F competition was a remarkable opportunity to showcase 
  SignTrack. The openness of the competition suited the idea behind the 
  project perfectly. Additionally, while working on the project, I 
  learned more about neural networks, sign language, and Free Software, 
  all equally important in their way.
</p>

<h2 id="elite-hacker-award-miquel-for-smart-table-assistant"> ü•à Elite Hacker Award: Miquel for Smart Table Assistant</h2>

<p>
  17-year-old Miquel from Catalonia, Spain, wins the second place with 
  <a href="https://github.com/puuiixx/SmartTableAssistant">Smart Table 
  Assistant</a>, a project with an astonishing aim which includes 
  software as well as hardware. Miquel created a robot-model intending 
  to help people with disabilities in the lower extremities. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRL_homPyIw">The table can 
  adapt to the user and makes the meals of the day easier</a>.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>How does it work?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Miquel</strong>: The Smart Table Assistant can memorize the 
  route from the starting point, go to the recipient and stay in 
  position until you give the order to return to the base. It can move 
  in many directions, thanks to the omnidirectional wheels located on 
  the platform of the‚Äùsmart table‚Äú. The device contains a remote 
  control that will perform certain functions, such as the availability 
  of a removable table, a cellar, turning on the backlight and making 
  room for the footrest. At the top of the table, it has a built-in 
  bucket which allows it to be removed after eating, so it can be 
  easier to clean the utensils used for eating and put it in the 
  dishwasher.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>It looks good, how did you design it?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Miquel</strong>: The robot has been designed with good 
  ergonomics in mind, then the instructions of the table have been 
  programmed, and after all, it has been applied to the elements 
  through Arduino. Finally, the mechanisms have been made to make it 
  work properly. The aesthetics of the product were inspired by the 
  shape of the pillars of the Sagrada Familia and the projection of 
  light from its stained glass windows. Most of the structure of this 
  project has been possible thanks to the 3D printing technology.
</p>

<h2 id="awesome-hacker-award-artur-for-aspinwall">ü•âAwesome Hacker Award: Artur for Aspinwall</h2>

<p>
  16-year-old Artur from Poland is an active Free Software supporter, 
  contributing to many projects such as Alpine Linux and postmarketOS, 
  as well as translating. He wins the third place of the competition 
  with <a href="https://github.com/aspinwall-ui/aspinwall">Aspinwall</a>, an 
  easy way to turn old touchscreen devices into smart displays.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>What does Aspinwall do?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Artur</strong>: Aspinwall is a user interface that can turn a 
  tablet or another mobile device into a personal assistant, showing 
  all of the most important information at a glance. The information 
  that is displayed can be customized through widgets, which can 
  contain anything - a to-do list, weather information, notifications‚Ä¶ 
  It‚Äôs a fun way to repurpose old devices that would otherwise collect 
  dust on a shelf or end up in a landfill.‚Äù</p>

<p class="question"><em>How did you come up with Apsinwall?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Artur</strong>: When I first came across the concept of‚Äùsmart 
  displays‚Äú, it sparked my curiosity - I liked how they looked while 
  remaining functional, and figured that a similar device could be 
  quite useful in daily life (for example, in a kitchen, where you may 
  want to get information about a recipe but don‚Äôt have the space/clean 
  hands to use a full tablet or laptop). My main concern, however, was 
  that most of these devices were produced by large tech giants known 
  for their extensive data collection. I felt that we could do better - 
  so, I started thinking about a Free Software alternative that could 
  also run on various old devices like tablets, with no expensive new 
  hardware needed. The idea stayed in my head for a while, but I never 
  got around to working on it. That‚Äôs when I heard about the YH4F 
  competition - it gave me the push needed to turn my concept into 
  reality.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>How was your experience of the competition?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Artur</strong>: I‚Äôve learnt quite a lot during the coding 
  period. Some of it was technical - I‚Äôve learnt how to use pygobject 
  and GTK, and improved my Python knowledge. Besides that, though, it 
  was a good exercise in time management - I had to figure out which 
  tasks to do and in what order to make it before the deadline. Having 
  to juggle the time between school and my project was a bit difficult 
  at times, but I‚Äôm still quite happy with how much I managed to do 
  before I ran out of time. Overall, it‚Äôs been a great learning 
  experience, and I got the motivation to work on a project that‚Äôs been 
  on my mind for quite a while. I‚Äôm excited to see what other 
  participants made for the competition, and to maybe meet them in 
  Brussels later this year. Thanks to the organizers for such a great 
  opportunity!
</p>

<h2 id="ultimate-girl-hacker-award-ekaterina-for-music-companion">üèÖUltimate Girl Hacker Award: Ekaterina for Music Companion</h2>

<p>
  17-year-old Ekaterina, living in Cyprus, likes to play the piano as 
  well as programming. Her interests gave her the winning idea: <a href="https://edugit.org/ateraeva/musiccompanion">a program helping 
  the user learn to play music</a>.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>What does Music Companion do?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Ekaterina</strong>: The program allows the user to get to 
  know with the basics of music, such as the notes, chords and scales. 
  By clicking on the different modes and reading the description in the 
  ‚Äú?‚Äù, you will explore this simple music glossary and acquire 
  knowledge of what is a scale, what are the different chords and other 
  music elements. In addition you will be able to hear how it sounds!
</p>

<p class="question"><em>How was your experience of the competition?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Ekaterina</strong>: Taking part in this competition was personally a big step as before it I have never ever programmed something and I did not have knowledge to do so. During the project I learned a lot more about programming concepts, how can I implement the modules and generally the programming language ‚Äì Python.
</p>

<h2 id="special-hacker-award-coming-from-warzone-mark-for-sharik">ü§ç  Special Hacker Award: Coming from warzone: Mark for Sharik</h2>

<p>
  When we announced the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom competition in 2021 we 
  welcomed people from all over Europe to participate. We did not 
  anticipate that during the coding period some of the participants 
  would find themselves in a warzone. Acknowledging that not everyone 
  could participate in peace, we give out the Special Hacker Award. 
  Mark from Ukraine wins the Special Hacker Award with his <a href="https://github.com/marchellodev/sharik">file-sharing 
  program</a>.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>What it Sharik?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Mark</strong>: Sharik is a simple, cross-platform solution for sharing files within a local network. While Sharik is extremely simple, pretty, and most importantly libre, it is also very versatile and minimalistic.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>How did you come up with the idea?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Mark</strong>: Having limited access to a high-speed 
  internet, it was common for me and my friends to share music, apps, 
  some documents for school, and other kinds of files directly via 
  bluetooth or numerous apps. Even though the task was extremely 
  simple, software that could do it was slow, full of ads, and frankly 
  ugly. That‚Äôs why, having some experience in software development, I 
  decided to build my own app.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>How was your experience of the competition?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>Mark</strong>: This competition showed me that building a 
  Free Software project is great, but advertising it should be a 
  priority. As the project becomes more popular, it attracts more 
  contributors, making the project better as a result.
</p>

<h2 id="youngest-hacker-award-h√©ctor-for-librehomework">‚≠ê Youngest Hacker Award: H√©ctor for LibreHomework</h2>

<p class="answer">
  15-year-old H√©ctor from Spain impressed with his <a href="https://edugit.org/HGEpro/LibreHomework">LibreHomework</a> and 
  won the Youngest Hacker Award. H√©ctor is a GNU/Linux user and a Free 
  Software enthusiast. Here is what he shares about his project.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>What is LibreHomework?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>H√©ctor</strong>: LibreHomework is a Free Softwaretool made 
  for students and by students. Schedule tasks and get notified, write 
  down exams, organize your documents and lock your screen to help you 
  focus on your tasks. The project is also available in 6 different 
  languages. In the upcoming update you‚Äôll also be able to meet other 
  students thanks to LibreHomework‚Äôs network. It‚Äôs still a work in 
  progress so feel free to check it out and suggest new features!
</p>

<p class="question"><em>How did you come up with the idea?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>H√©ctor</strong>: Most of students have problems organizing 
  their tasks, so why not make it easier? There are already tools for 
  that, but is it any of them Free Software? How many features does it 
  have? Are they too simple or too complicated? That‚Äôs why I created 
  LibreHomework.
</p>

<p class="question"><em>How was your experience of the competition?</em></p>

<p class="answer">
  <strong>H√©ctor</strong>: I initially discovered this competition 
  thanks to my IT teacher. Before that I was already looking for a new 
  exciting project to work on, so this opportunity was perfect. The 
  idea was born because I felt students lack (good enough) Free 
  Software tools. The concept is quite simple but as I had enough time 
  I decided to expand it into something bigger, so I ended up learning 
  some technical stuff such as server management and web development.
</p>
