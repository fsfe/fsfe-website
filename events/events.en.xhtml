      Free Software Foundation Europe participates in many Free
      Software events. If you know about a FSFE related event that is not yet
      listed here or that you run on your own, you can easily add it by
      using our <a href="/community/tools/eventregistration.html">event
      announcement tool</a>."
    </p>

    <p>
      FSFE event announcements are also available via
      <a href="events.rss" class="feed">RSS feed</a> as well as an
      <a href="webcal://fsfe.org/events/events.en.ics">iCalendar feed</a>.
