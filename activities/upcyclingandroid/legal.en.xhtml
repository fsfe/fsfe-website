      <h3>Does rooting your device (e.g. an Android phone) and replacing its operating system with something else void your statutory warranty, if you are a consumer?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>In short: No.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Statutory warranty should not become void by replacing the OS on an android phone. Vendors should provide a warranty as long as you have bought the device as a consumer in the European Union, unless the trader proves that the consumer's digital environment is not compatible with the technical requirements of the digital content or services supplied and provided that the trader has informed the consumer about such requirements in a clear and comprehensible manner before the conclusion of the contract.
