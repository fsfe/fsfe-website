    <h1>Democracy requires Free Software</h1>

    <p>
      Throughout history technology has influenced society. Reading,
      writing, arithmetic, agriculture, printing and radio are all examples 
      of developments that changed the way we interact through trade, art and science. 
      The most important cultural technology of the 21st century is software.  The
      Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is committed to ensuring that
      people in our society have the right to shape this technology as they see fit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today it is impossible to imagine daily life without software. 
      The majority of us can't spend a single day without using
      it. People use software in the
      workplace, on laptops, and on mobile phones. Software is also found in
      less obvious places however: in trains, cars,
      televisions, washing-machines, fridges, and many other devices. None
      of these devices could function  without software.  Without software we
      couldn't write e-mails, make phone calls, go shopping, or travel as we
      are accustomed to. Software is our society's central tool.
    </p>

    <h2>Unchained</h2>

    <p>
      When others control a tool as important to us as software, they are
      able to exert great influence over our actions. Whoever controls the search
      engine that we use determines what we find. He who controls our e-mails
      has the opportunity to censor us. Simply put, control of a communication
      service entails the ability to decide who can exchange
      what with whom. Similarly whoever decides how software operates has great
      influence over how we live and work.
    </p>

    <p> In modern democracies power is separated. We distribute legislative,
    executive and judiciary powers between different institutions. Furthermore
    we distribute responsibilities between several levels of competence, e.g.
    central government, regional government, and local government. A key
    function of the freedom of the press is to safeguard against the formation
    of an informational monopoly, where too much power would be concentrated in
    too few hands. A key benefit of effective democracy is that you could give any 
    office inside the democratic system to your worst opponent.
    </p>

    <p>
      It would represent a great danger to democracy if the critical social instrument
      that software constitutes were controlled by only a small group. Not 
      only does our communication depend on software, but
      also a big part of society's infrastructure. FSFE wants to voice the
      interests of computer users, and to hand control of software's future to
      everybody. Society cannot afford to be dependant on private interests when it
      comes to a tool as important as software.
    </p>

    <h2>Freedom</h2>

    <p>
      Our society must ensure that everybody has the opportunity to shape 
      software for themselves. This requires that we have the freedom to use
      software for any purpose, to study how it works, to share it with others,
      and to make improvements.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Use:</strong> The freedom to use the software for any
        purpose fights discrimination, and ensures equal opportunity for
        everyone to participate in the society.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Study:</strong> The freedom to study how software functions is
        central to an understanding of how this critical tool works.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Share:</strong> The freedom to distribute the software
        ensures that we can assist others by sharing it with them.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Improve:</strong> Lastly, a society must have the freedom to change
        its tools in order to develop them, and to adapt them to personal needs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Software that respects these four freedoms is Free Software.
    </p>

    <p>
      A democratic society needs firm foundations. One of these foundations is Free
      Software.
