    <title>DIS-29500: Deprecated before use?</title>
    <description>
FSFE context briefing on the DIS-29500 Ballot Resolution Meeting (BRM)
for Microsoft's Office OpenXML format: "When ECMA submitted MS-OOXML
as ECMA-376 to ISO for fast-track approval, several countries
criticised overlap with the existing ISO standard ISO/IEC 26300:2006,
the Open Document Format (ODF). [...] Considering that alleged
preservation of idiosyncrasies is the stated reason for the entire
DIS-29500 ISO process, FSFE considers it worthwhile to investigate
this claim in greater depth."
