    <title>Classification of Free Software as a World Cultural Heritage</title>
    <description>
      The objectives were to have Free Software classified as an intangible
			world cultural heritage by the UNESCO, and registered in the World
			Memory Register (another UNESCO project). The Free Software
			community and the UNESCO share the same freedom, equality and
			fraternity values. Such a recognition would be a great promotion
			of Free Software.
