	    In an event organised by FSFE's associate organisation
	    Irish Free Software Organisation, FSFE's Brussels
	    Representative, Ciaran O'Riordan, will speak about his
	    work to prevent software patents, and what could be the
	    road ahead.  He, and the other speakers, will also discuss
	    similar legislation, which is getting much less attention,
