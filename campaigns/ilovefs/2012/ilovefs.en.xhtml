<h2>#ilovefs day 2012</h2>

<p>As every year, Valentine's Day will be celebrated on the 14th of
February, which will be a Tuesday this year. Similar to <a
href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/maelle/?p=228">last year</a>, the FSFE is
planning an online campaign to celebrate this day as an "I love Free
Software" - Day. Additionally, there will be an <a
href="/campaigns/ilovefs/2012/unperfekthaus.html">"I love Free Software" - event this year in the Unperfekthaus in
Essen</a>.</p>


<h2>Campaign: Spread your love for Free Software</h2> 

<p>Our online campaign aims at rising awareness to Free Software and the
passionate, hard-working people behind it. 

show them that you appreciate their work – it could make all the difference!
Others already did so, to get inspired you can <a
  href="/campaigns/ilovefs/2012/whylovefs.html">read why they love Free
  Software</a>.  </p>

<p>Of course, there are lots of ways to declare one's love... Here are just
some ideas about how you can go public and proclaim your love to Free
Software.</p>

<ul>

  <li><strong>E-Mail/Letters</strong> Send active Free Software supporters a
  message thanking them for their work. Do not underestimate the effects of
  such a message. As many Free Software developers work hard for their projects
  without earning money, a big "thank you" / "love you" is like good fuel for
  their further encouragement </li>

  <li><strong>Microblog</strong> Especially on Valentine's Day, microblog about
  how you love Free Software, and use the Hashtag <!-- [dont't translate the
  comment] link either to http://identi.ca/tag/ilovefs or to the agregation of
  dents underneath--> <strong><a href="http://identi.ca/tag/ilovefs">#ilovefs</a></strong>. Encourage
  your friends to do as well, let us try to push our message in a high ranking on Twitter
  trends and hashtag timelines in identi.ca and other blogging system. </li>

  <li><strong>Blog</strong> If you are a Blogger, blog about the "I love Free
  Software" - Day and the idea behind it. Get people attracted by the idea of
  Free Software.</li>

  <li><strong>Banners</strong> We set up a <a href="/campaigns/ilovefs/2012/banners.html">page
    showing different banners</a> that support the "I love Free Software" - Day
  and that are free to use. Some even come along with code snippets to easily
  implement it on your homepage or blog.</li>

  <li><strong>Promotion</strong> If you are living in Germany, please promote <a
    href="/campaigns/ilovefs/2012/unperfekthaus.html">our event in the Unperfekt-Haus in
    Essen</a></li>
