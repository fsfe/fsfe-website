      The tenth Austrian Fellowship meeting takes place on 16 March
      in Vienna. We meet around 18:00 in the Library Room at the Metalab,
      Rathausstra√üe 6, first district. The "official" agenda will start at
      19:00.<br/>

      A major topic this time is the planning of FSFE's participation in this
      year's Linuxwochen event series in Austria<br/>

      As usual, this invitation addresses to all people interested in FSFE or
      Free Software. We are looking forward to many attendants!
