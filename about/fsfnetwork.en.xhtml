        FSFE is one of four Free Software organizations in the world.
      </p>

    <p>
      The following organisations are sister organisations of the FSFE
      in the global FSF network.  We are working together on Free
      Software issues, each one with its own cultural background.  The
      FSF's are legally, financially and personally independent from each
      other, and like every network, the FSF* network is formed of
      interconnected components.
