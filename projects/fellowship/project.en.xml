    <title>Fellowship of FSFE</title>
    <description>
      The Fellowship of the Free Software Foundation Europe is a community of
      people united by their interest in Free Software and freedom in all
      aspects of the digital age. It is the easiest and most direct way to get
      involved with, remain informed about and support the work of the Free
      Software Foundation Europe.<br />
      This is the place where we all come together. Not least for the cool
      features, namely the Cryptocard.
