<center><h2>Associate Organisations of the FSF Europe</h2></center>

<p>Associate organisations are independent of the FSF Europe and
entirely autonomous. They are completely self-run and -managed in
all aspects (such as membership, statutes, finances and so on).</p>

<p>Being associate means being formally allied and having immediate
access to the FSF Europe. So associates are usually involved in the
internal communication and consideration process. Also we will work
together for campaigns and events such as tradeshows.</p>

<p>As a lot of the regular work is often done by volunteers from
associate organisations, joining one of these organisations is an easy
way of becoming involved in the FSF Europe's activities.</p>

<p>If you wish to know more about the associate status, you will
find that information <a href="/associates/about.html">here</a>.</p>
