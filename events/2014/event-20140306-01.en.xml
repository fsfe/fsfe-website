   <title>First meet-up of the new Fellowshipgroup in Zürich, Switzerland</title>
   <body>
    On Thursday, March 6th, at 6pm there will be a first meet-up of the Zürich Fellowshipgroup since renewing. Invited are all supporters of Free Software as well as other interested persons. As this is the first meet-up, we will mainly discuss about self organisation and further activities. The meeting will be in Stampfenbachstrasse 69, E-Stock, ID-Lounge (ETH Zürich). Who will not be able to make it in time, is of course invited to join later.
