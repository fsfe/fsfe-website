    <title>Commission to Microsoft: Preventing interoperability has a price</title>
    <body>
European Commission to fine Microsoft 1.5 million Euro per day
retroactively from 16. December 2005, totalling 280.5 million Euro.
Should Microsoft not come into compliance until the end of July 2006,
the daily fines could be doubled. These fines are a reaction to
Microsofts continued lack of compliance with the European Commission
decision to make interoperability information available to competitors
as a necessary precondition to allow fair competition. FSFE has
supported the European Commission from the start of the suit in 2001.
