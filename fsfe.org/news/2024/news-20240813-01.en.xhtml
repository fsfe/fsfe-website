<h1>YH4F Countdown: Time for Jury evaluation and new sponsor on board</h1>

<p>
The FSFE’s hacking competition for young Europeans successfully 
concluded its six-month programming period on 30 June, with the 
submission of the participants’ projects. Now, it's the jury's turn to 
evaluate the work of the participants. We are also happy to announce a 
new sponsor for the contest, OpenSSF.
</p>

<p>
The third programming period of Youth Hacking 4 Freedom has ended. During 
the past six months, teenagers from all over Europe worked on their Free 
Software projects, and eventually submitted their work for evaluation to 
the jury. To give you a teaser, 2024 submissions include Free Software 
research and scientific projects, projects that tackle social problems, 
and some fun games. As with previous editions, it is 
stunning to see the great ideas the teenagers come up with. And the best 
thing is to see how they manage to stick to a project idea for six 
months.
</p>  


<p>
Now it is the jury’s turn to evaluate all the amazing projects and 
decide on the six winners, who will join us in October for the award 
ceremony in Brussels.
</p>

<h3>Why your company or organisation should sponsor YH4F</h3>

<p>
Youth Hacking 4 Freedom is possible thanks to it's financial contributors. Just recently OpenSSF joined as sponsor. With their support, the FSFE can keep organising this programming competition for young Europeans 
and help to spread knowledge about Free Software, helping the participants 
to develop programming and project management skills while having fun 
and meeting new people from all over Europe.
</p>

<p>
As an organisation or company, you can sponsor Youth Hacking 4 Freedom 
or even better, become a donor. By supporting Youth Hacking 4 Freedom, 
you contribute to strengthening young people's skills, enhancing their 
understanding about Free Software, and helping them to develop crucial 
competencies like time management.
