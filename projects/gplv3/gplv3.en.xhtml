<h2 id="intro">Introduction: What's happening</h2>

<p>
  On January 16th 2006, <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software
  Foundation (FSF)</a>, our sister organisation in the United States, published the first
  discussion draft of the GPL version 3 and launched a public
  consulation process which will last approximately one year.
</p>

<p>
  At the end of this, FSF will publish version three of the GNU General
  Public License.  This licence, commonly called &quot;the GPL&quot;,
  is by far the most used licence for <a
  href="/documents/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The task of the GPL is to ensure that everyone who receives a copy
  of GPL-licenced software is free to use that software, to modify it,
  and to redistribute it.  The number of people who use software which
  is distributed under the terms of the GPL is somewhere in the region
  of 100s of millions.
</p>

<p>
  Version 2 of the GPL was published in 1991.  Version 3 will do the
  same job as version 2 but will be updated to account for changes in
  software's legal and technical environment, and to thwart new
  techniques devised in the past fifteen years to take the above
  freedoms away from software users.
</p>
