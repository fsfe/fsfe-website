    "Kirschner's book introduces readers young and old to the power and 
    peril of software. It also highlights the accelerating effects of 
    sharing software freely - creating conditions for direct and 
    indirect collaboration which can be a metaphor for the conduct of 
    science.  Behind it all is a backdrop of ethics of knowledge 
    sharing upon which the arc of human history rides."
