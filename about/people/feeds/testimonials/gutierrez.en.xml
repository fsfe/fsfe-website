	  Nowadays we use social networks, laptops and mobile devices every day.
	  And very frequently we lose the important social and political vision
	  of free software in all of them. Thanks to FSFE, FSF and other similar
	  organizations and many local groups, we maintain the torch of a
	  different world where everyone can use and share a lot of programs and
	  code, no matter the country you live in or how much money you can
	  afford to spend on it.
