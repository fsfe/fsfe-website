  <h3>Join Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</h3>

  <p> 
	Are you up to hack on a software project of your choice? Do you 
	want to meet like-minded people of your age from around Europe? 
	What about getting the chance to receive one of our cash awards and 
	to travel to Brussels to meet the other winners and great people 
	from the Free Software movement? Then, join the YH4F competition! 
	The only precondition for you to join is that you are <em>13-18 </em> years 
	old and you live in Europe. Start by <strong>registering before Sunday, 31 
	October 2021</strong>. 
  </p>

  <p>
	  We are dedicated to offering an inclusive environment in the 
	  YH4F, and we would like to encourage teenagers of all genders to 
	  join! We will make sure everyone will enjoy the process and will 
	  leave this competition with added knowledge and a smile. 
  </p>

  <h3>Decide yourself what you code</h3>

  <p> 
	There is no set challenge or topic on the software you should 
	develop. Embrace your imagination and create what is the most 
	interesting to you. It can address an everyday problem you have, or 
	it can be just fun. The possibilities are endless! The only 
	condition for the competition is that the program should be <a 
	href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>, so that 
	others can use, study, share, and improve the code in the future.
  </p>

  <h3>Take the time you need</h3>

  <p>
	From Monday 1 November 2021 to Thursday 31 March 2022, you will 
	have five months to come up with an idea for a Free Software 
	program and write it. During the coding period you will be invited 
	to an online group meeting, where you and other participants can 
	briefly follow each other’s work, exchange ideas, and share 
	problem-solving tips.
  </p>

  <h3>Present your program to top experts</h3>

  <p> 
	Your software project will be in good hands, as it will be 
	evaluated by Free Software experts. <em><a href="/activities/yh4f/evaluation.html">Our jury
    members</a></em> excel in 
	software development and are deeply involved in the Free Software 
	movement. At the same time, they are excellent people to work with. 
	After you submit your program, you will have the chance to present 
	it to them, as part of your evaluation. This is a nice opportunity 
	for you to discuss your idea and your achievement with experienced 
	people on the field.
  </p>

  <h3>Awesome awards and experiences await</h3>

  <p> 
	Based on the jury’s grades, the winners are determined and 
	announced. The first six places will be awarded with  <em>cash 
	between 1.024€ and 4.096€ each </em>. The Award Ceremony of YH4F 
	will take place in Brussels in June 2021. All the winners will be 
	invited there with covered costs. The Award Ceremony will have top 
	speakers in the field of Free Software and it will be a time of 
	celebration. You made it! Your hard work paid off. Now you can 
	enjoy 2 educative and exciting days in Brussels and socialise with 
	your fellow winners.
