<h1>Chaos Communication Camp: Call for Participation</h1>

	<p>
	After four years of waiting and many online conferences – probably too 
	many –, the Chaos Communication Camp is finally back! Come and camp 
	with us in the 'Bits &amp; Bäume' village from 15th to 19th August 2023. 
	The Free Software Foundation Europe is part of this year's 'Bits &amp; 
	Bäume' village.

	<p>
	Together with many different groups, the FSFE is organising the 'Bits 
	&amp; Bäume' village. This is a space for all CCCamp participants to 
	come together, talk about Free Software and sustainability, connect 
	with others, or simply visit the FSFE booth. The 'Bits 
	&amp; Bäume' village is not just a meeting place
 but also a space for input sessions and listening to new ideas, as it 
 is involved in organising one of the five 
 central stages.
	</p>

	<h2>Call for Participation: Let's Boost Our Resilience</h2>

	<p>
	As a village, we focus on connecting environmental issues with 
	technology. Together, we are searching for solutions for a sustainable world that respects both nature and digital human rights. Let's rethink our technological world and increase our resilience.
	</p>

	<p>
	Do you have insights, thoughts, and experiences to share? Are you 
	interested in Free Software and the sustainable use and provision of 
	technology, such as hacking or upgrading old devices? We are looking 
	for inspiring talks, hands-on workshops, community/developer/strategy 
	meetings, or any other public, informative, or collaborative 
	activities.
	</p>

	<p>
	Together with 'Bits &amp; Bäume', the Free Software Foundation Europe 
	will provide a stage and a workshop area. <strong>If you're interested in 
	applying, please submit your talk or workshop 
	proposal to <a 
	href="https://pretalx.c3voc.de/chaos-communication-camp-2023/cfp">the 
	official Call for Participation</a> for the Chaos 
	Communication Camp by June 9th.</strong> Please choose the 'Bits &amp; Bäume' channel.
	Session slots range from 20 to 45 minutes. Please indicate your preferred length in your 
	submission.
	</p>

	<p>
	As the climate crisis mostly affects people in the Global South, we 
	would particularly encourage those individuals to share their ideas for 
	a resilient technological world. We look forward to your proposals. We 
	actively encourage FLINTA* and Queer* people, BIPOC, and people from 
	the Global South to apply.
	</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>
	Note: The acceptance of your talk will not provide you with a ticket. A 
	ticket is necessary for attending the conference and holding a 
	talk or giving a workshop. Ticket information will be available on 
	<a href="https://events.ccc.de/category/camp-2023/">events.ccc.de</a> once the pre-sale begins.
