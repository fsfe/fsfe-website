    <title>Blog: How the European patent system works</title>
    <body>
      <p> Now that software patents are back on the table, it’s
      important to understand how the European patent system actually
      works. You need to know this in order to discuss the unitary
      patent and FSFE’s demands with the MEPs you call and ask for
      support. Patent policy belongs under legislative control. Our current
      political processes and institutions aren’t perfect, but they’re
      certainly better than the EPO’s secretive insider culture. Good
      patent policy needs transparency, accountability and
      participation. The current proposal for the unitary patent lacks
      all of these things.
