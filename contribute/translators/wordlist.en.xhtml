      About the Free Software Foundation Europe

      The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is a non-profit
      non-governmental organisation active in many European countries and
      involved in many global activities. Access to software determines
      participation in a digital society. To secure equal participation
      in the information age, as well as freedom of competition, the Free
      Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) pursues and is dedicated to the
      furthering of Free Software, defined by the freedoms to use, study,
      modify and copy. Founded in 2001, creating awareness for these
      issues, securing Free Software politically and legally, and giving
      people Freedom by supporting development of Free Software are
      central issues of the FSFE.

      About the Freedom Task Force

      The Freedom Task Force is an activity run by Free Software Foundation 
      Europe to help people understand Free Software licensing and the 
      opportunities it presents. We offer educational services, facilitate 
      larger infrastructure activities and manage FSFE's legal affairs. 
      Our goals are to share knowledge about Free Software law, to 
      safeguard the interests of Free Software projects, to connect 
      experts in this field and to help other groups achieve similar goals.
      We believe in positive, constructive dialogue and seek at all times 
      to support the long-term sustainability of Free Software.
