    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    
    <p>The European Commission's original proposal for the directive was
        heavily criticised for allowing unlimited patenting of software,
        calcuation rules and business processes, while making the claim of not
        doing so.</p>
        
    <p class="indent"><b>September 24, 2003:</b> The European Parliament, the
        only body in the European Union that is elected directly by its
        citizens, had to decide on the commission's proposal. Giving the needs
        of European citizens and industry preference, the Parliament passed the
        directive after limiting the scope of patentability to exclude pure,
        abstract software without a technical context.</p>
        
     <p class="indent">This decision was regarded a victory for democracy and a
         step towards a more transparent and participatory European Union by
         many.</p>
        
     <p class="indent"><b>May 18, 2004:</b> The council of the European Union,
         a body representing the Ministers of its member states, rejected the
         parliament's version. Instead it agreed upon a new proposal of the
         commission that was in effect identical to the original proposal, in
         some respects even worse. Formal adoption of that proposal was
         delayed, however.</p>
        
     <p class="indent"><b>December 21, 2004:</b> The directive was put on the
         agenda of the EU Council on Agriculture and Fishery to be approved as
         a so-called "A-item" without further discussion.</p>
        
     <p class="indent">Paying an unexpected visit, Poland's Vice Minister of
         Science, Wodzimierz Marcinski, vetoed this item at the beginning of
         the meeting, so it was taken off the agenda. Poland received much
         well-deserved applause for this act in defense of democracy and
         prevented serious harm to European economy.</p>
        
     <p class="indent">The EU Council can now decide to either try again
         passing the directive as a so-called "A-item" without further
         discussion or to make it a "B-item", allowing for further
         discussion.</p>
        
    <p>Since it is likely that growing public and political resistance
        against software patents in several countries will then influence the
        outcome significantly, it is also possible they will try to bury the
        directive silently and push again for software patents in the scope of
        another directive, hoping that will pass unnoticed.</p>
        
    <p> For that reason, FSFE asks that the directive is put on the agenda as
        a "B-item" for further discussion to reintroduce the changes made on
        September 24, 2003 by the European Parliament so it can then be
        finally adopted in the second reading in the Parliament.</p>
        
     <p>Until that time it is important that people and companies keep voicing
         their dissent with the plans for software patentability and support
         the initiatives to make this dissent visible -- such as the campaigns
         by FSFEs <a href="/associates/associates.html">associate
             organisation</a>, the <a href="http://www.ffii.org"
             target="_blank">FFII</a>.</p>
