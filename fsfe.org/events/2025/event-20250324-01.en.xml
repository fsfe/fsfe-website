      <p>On 24 March, at 17:30 (CET), the FSFE will conduct an online Q&amp;A session about the Digital Markets Act and its importance for representatives of Free Software organisations. The DMA was designed to limit the power of the &quot;gatekeepers&quot; and boost fairer digital markets. But what does its enforcement mean for Free Software? Join us for this strategic discussion. Registration is required.</p>
