<h2 id="new-podcast-how-can-we-prevent-violations-against-free-software-licenses-">New podcast: How can we prevent violations against Free Software licenses?</h2>
  
  <p>
	  Till Jaeger shared his insight on <a href="/news/podcast/episode-12.html">how can 
	  we enforce Free Software licenses</a>. In a podcast hosted by 
	  Matthias Kirschner he recalled the beginning of this effort in 
	  2004. This was the first time when a violation of the GNU General 
	  Public Licence (GNU GPL) led to a court case and a settlement. 
	  The person behind this initiative was Harald Welte who afterwards 
	  created a project to rectify <a href="https://gpl-violations.org/">GPL violations</a>.

  <p>
	  17 years after the first court case we now have many more tools 
	  to prevent violations against Free Software licenses. Compliance 
	  information is clearer, and workshops such as the ones offered by 
	  the FSFE Legal Network are available. Still, Till suggests 
	  further simplification of licences, interoperability, and licence 
	  compatibility. Finally, Till thanks everyone doing GNU/Linux 
	  distributions for their crucial work.

<h2 id="youth-hacking-4-freedom-coding-contest-for-teenagers">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom: coding contest for teenagers</h2>
  <p>
	  Software development is a powerful, and often self-taught, skill; 
	  people who started programming in a young age deserve 
	  encouragement. To this end, we are organising a coding 
	  competition for teenagers around Europe,  <a href="/activities/yh4f/">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</a>.  From 1 November 
	  2021 to 31 March 2022, you can code any type of software you 
	  want, as long as it is Free Software. The winners will be awarded 
cash prizes (2 x 4096€, 2 x 2048€, 2 x 1024€) and a trip to 
	  Brussels. The <a href="/activities/yh4f/jury.html">evaluation</a> 
	  phase will be carried out by Free Software experts.
  </p>

	  Are you between 14-18 and have already started programming? Join 
	  us! Just make sure you <a href="/activities/yh4f/">register</a> 
	  until <strong>Sunday, 31 October</strong> 2021. Our <a href="/activities/yh4f/faq.html">FAQs</a> might help. We are

	  we encourage people of all genders to join! We will make sure 
	  everyone will enjoy the process and will leave this competition

<h2 id="hittfeld-high-school-shows-its-support-to-free-software-projects-and-the-fsfe">Hittfeld high school shows its support to Free Software projects and the FSFE</h2>
  <p>
	  The 2021 <a href="https://mastodon.social/@protabletcomputer/106895644060491971">yearbook</a> 
	  of a high school was successfully completed using Free Software, 
	  and the editorial team donated all profits from the sale to Free 
	  Software projects and the FSFE. This is the story of Hittfeld high school in Seevetal, in the German state of Lower Saxony.
  </p>

  <figure>
     <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/0d6cf5051ade30de60de4d463da46d01.jpeg" alt="School Yearbook"/>
     <figcaption>This yearbook was created using Free Software like 
	  LibreOffice, GNOME-Desktop, Ubuntu, Nextcloud, gThumb, darktable, 
	  PDF Arranger, LimeSurvey, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, 
	  MailMerge, Jitsi Meet, OpenStreet, Inkscape, and 
	  GIMP.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p>
	  The editorial team mentions that it is beneficial for the school 
	  to avoid paying expensive subscriptions to proprietary programs. 
	  We deeply thank the pupils and everyone involved in the donation 
	  decision. This kind gesture is a nice reminder that we should 
	  support those who provide us great tools without restricting our 
	  freedom. We encourage everyone to support Free Software projects, 
	  just as the Hittfeld high school did.

<h2 id="what-we-have-done">What we have done</h2>
  <p>
	  During the final week before the German federal election we 
	  reached out to politicians asking their stance on Free Software, 
	  in line with our <a href="/activities/elections/index.html">electoral 
	  activities</a>. Alexander Sander, FSFE Policy Consultant, and 
	  Karl Krüger from our associated organisation OSB Alliance 
	  conducted <a href="/news/2021/news-20210920-01.html">5 
	  interviews</a> (DE) with representatives of German political 
	  parties from 20 to 24 September. From CDU we spoke with 
	  Nadine Schön, MdB, CDU Deputy Chairwoman of the CDU/CSU 
	  parliamentary group in the Bundestag. We interviewed three 
	  members of the Digital Agenda Committee: Elvan Korkmaz-Emre from 
	  SPD, Manuel Höferlin from FDP, and Anke Domscheit-Berg from Die 
	  Linke. From the Greens, we spoke with Margit Stumpp, MdB, 
	  member of the Committee on Cultural and Media Affairs. The 5 
	  videos are available in German. Also we released our <a href="https://digitalezivilgesellschaft.org/digitalvisionen/">vision 
	  for the upcoming decades and concrete demands for the next 
	  government</a> and analyzed the <a href="https://digitalezivilgesellschaft.org/wahlpruefsteine/oeffentliches-gut/">election
	  programs</a> of the parties.
