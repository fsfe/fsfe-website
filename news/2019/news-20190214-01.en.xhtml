<p>Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives; and it is important that this technology empowers rather than restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy. And Free Software is also the result of people who work together collaboratively and dedicate their skills to a project. "I love Free Software" Day is a day to show our appreciation to all these people behind any Free Software project and our gratitude for their dedication:https://ilovefs.org</p>
