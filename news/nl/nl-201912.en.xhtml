	<h1 id="fsfe-newsletter-november-2019">CDU wants public code +++ Community Meeting +++ 36C3</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">The last Newsletter of the year ends with exciting news for software freedom: the biggest conservative party in Europe, the German CDU, endorsed the principle that software developed with public money should be under a Free Software License. We further invite you to to read about the FSFE has done and achieved during the last 12 months and to dig into Florian Snow's report of our Annual Community Meeting 2019. Also you find an outlook on our participation at the biggest hacking related conference in Europe, the 36C3 and a call for your support and help to continue our mission towards empowering users to control technology.</p>

	<p>During the last week of November, Germany&#39;s  conservative party &quot;CDU&quot;  had their 32nd Annual Conference in Leipzig. As part of the event, the party updated their convention and included a tribute towards Free Software in their Chapter for Digital Innovation. With this update, the CDU resolved to join the FSFE in <a href="/news/2019/news-20191125-01.html">demanding that  software developed with public money should be publicly available as Free Software</a>. </p>

	<p>The CDU&#39;s party convention resolution states: &quot;[...] This is why the following will apply to all (public) digitalisation projects in Germany in the future: the awarding of contracts and funding will be subject to compliance with the principles of open source and open standards. Software financed by public funds should serve all citizens. In addition, free and open APIs should facilitate access for independent developments.&quot; (Translation provided by the FSFE)</p>

	<p>We are happy to see that the good energy and resources the FSFE community dedicates on creating, translating and promoting the campaign&#39;s objectives keeps increasing support from major public stakeholders. &quot;We now expect the CDU to  immediately work within the government to create the legal basis for publicly funded software to be released under a Free- and Open-Source Software license.&quot; says Matthias Kirschner, President of the FSFE.</p>

<h2 id="get-active">Get Active</h2>

	<p>2019 was a year with a lot of challenges and we have seen quite some changes within the Free Software environment. On one hand Free Software usage is as widespread as never before and our &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; campaign receives a lot of endorsement -  on the other hand Free Software is constantly under threat. Big economic players buy into Free Software and politicians create laws that directly endanger software freedom. Not to forget that with every proprietary app developed by a public authority or solely offered on a proprietary platform, more citizens are forced every day to expel their freedom. And with every app more, the threshold gets higher for everyone to break free from the proprietary world and from vendor lock-ins. </p>
	<p>Since 2001, the FSFE promotes software freedom and on this road we have achieved many things - but protecting freedom never ends.
