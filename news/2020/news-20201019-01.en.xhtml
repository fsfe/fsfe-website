<h1>FSFE at SFSCon 2020</h1>

<p>
  The South Tyrol Free Software Conference, SFSCon, is one of Europe’s most established annual conferences on Free Software. 
  In recent years we have been represented with talks, workshops and our information booth. Last year we also organised our 
  Community Event in the context of SFSCon, so that we could meet not only our community but also many interested people and 
  report about our work. 
</p>

<p>Due to the current situation, the SFSCon 2020 can unfortunately only take place in blended mode: both online and at NOI Techpark, for a 
limited number of people. But of course, the FSFE is again contributing to the programme.</p>

<p>The FSFE has organised several talks in which legal issues are clarified and current political developments are analysed. Concrete practical 
questions concerning compliance, for example for SMEs, will be addressed as well as questions about machine learning and which problems 
arise in the development of a free smartphone.</p>

<p>Besides other <a href="https://www.sfscon.it/programs/2020/">interesting talks</a>, the talks below are from the FSFE track, for which we encouraged 
speakers to submit a talk to the SFScon:</p>

<p>If you want to get some impressions from last year's Community Meeting at SFSCOn, please <a href="/news/2019/news-20191205-01.html">read the 2019 report</a>.</p>

<p>We would be pleased if you would participate in this year's SFSCon with us and support software freedom with us.</p>

<p>The biggest financial impact the FSFE faces in these times of physical distancing is the cancellation of Free Software conferences, including our own events. 
To keep the software freedom movement solid and alive, <a href="https://my.fsfe.org/donate">please consider to donate a part of your conference budget 
to Free Software organisations, including the FSFE.</a></p>

<p>See you at SFSCon 2020.</p>
