  <h1>Youth Hacking 4 Freedom 2021/2022</h1>

  <div id="introduction">
    <p>
      If you like experimenting with software development, if you often start
      coding and find yourself losing motivation halfway, if you want to meet
      people of your age with the same interests, this winter just got way more
      exciting.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    The FSFE organises a hacking competition for young people from Europe aged
    from 13 to 19. Youth Hacking 4 Freedom wants to inspire young talented
    minds and to support them in their first steps. During the competition, you
    will have the opportunity to learn the values of Free Software. Our large
    cash prizes will keep you focused, and, if won, they can be used to advance
    your education on Computer Science, or in any other way you want. The first
    places for women and men will be awarded with 4.096€, the second places with
    2.048€, and the third places with 1.024€. All participants who submit a
    program at the end of the round will get a participation certificate. The
    submitted projects will be evaluated by our jury members, and the winners
    will be awarded during a ceremony in Brussels in June 2022.
  </p>

  <h2>Facts and questions</h2>

  <p>
    You surely have a lot of questions already. Let's go through them!
  </p>

  <h3>What type of Software should I make?</h3>

  <p>
    The type of software project you will choose is up to you, the possibilities
    are endless. The only condition for the competition is that the program
    should be <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>. We
    will show you how to label your program as Free Software during the
    beginning of the competition.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I receive help?</h3>

  <p>
    Yes. Exchanging ideas and seeking for help is encouraged in programming. You
    can ask for help from your teachers, Linux user groups, friends, or anyone
    you trust, and you will still be eligible for the competition. However, we
    have to make sure that you had an active role in your project. At the end of
    the competition, you will have to talk about the project in your own words,
    and you should be in a position to explain to a jury member how you achieved
    the final result, and to answer their questions.
  </p>

  <h3>How will my program be evaluated?</h3>

  <p>
    The programs will be evaluated by the jury based on three levels: the idea,
    the implementation, and the presentation. The idea behind the program will
    be evaluated based on its originality, its practical relevance, and its
    aims. Does the program already exist? What does it offer? The implementation
    of the program will be evaluated based on the self-reliance, the difficulty,
    and the creativity of the program. Finally, the quality of presentation of
    the program, especially the readability and clarity of the report and the
    README file will be taken into account.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I come to the ceremony?</h3>

  <p>
    Youth Hacking 4 Freedom will cover the accommodation and travel costs for
    the winners and for one parent of each. Three additional participants will
    be selected to join the ceremony with their costs covered. Every participant
    will be invited to the ceremony.
  </p>

  <div class="color-box" data-color="fsfe-blue">
    <h3>What are the important dates?</h3>

    <p>
      Register until 10 October 2021. The coding phase begins at 15 October 2021
      and ends at 30 April 2022. You are not expected to devote all this time into
      your project; you have seven months so that you can be flexible in your
      schedule. The Award Ceremony will take place in June 2022.

      Twenty years ago, Reinhard Wiesemann, the sponsor of Youth Hacking 4
      Freedom, won a hacking competition for young people. Reinhard used the
      money from his cash prize to advance his professional development. He
      remembers that competition as a unique experience, fun as well as
      rewarding.
