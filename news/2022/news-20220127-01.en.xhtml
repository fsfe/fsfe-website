  <h1>The FSFE at FOSDEM 2022</h1>

 <p>As in 2021, this year's FOSDEM will take place online. But this is neither stopping 
us from once again co-hosting the Legal and Policy Issues Devroom nor from being present 
with a digital booth. We are excited and look forward to presenting you an interesting 
programme throughout the whole weekend.</p> 


<p>As every year, the FSFE will be present at <a href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a>, the biggest 
annual Free Software event in Europe. In this years edition we will co-host the 
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/legal_and_policy_issues/">Legal and Policy Issues Devroom </a> for the second 
time â€“ unfortunately only digitally again. Nonetheless, we have prepared an exciting schedule for you on Saturday 
and hope to see you there.

 <p>This year's edition will be kicked off by a talk of Masafumi Ohta, teaching on Free Software license and 
 compliances at the University of Electro-Communications in Japan at 13:00 CET. In his talk, Ohta addresses 
 the issue on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/teachingoss/">"How to teach OSS licenses and compliances at a university"</a>. 
 </p>
 
 <p>At 13:30 CET, Italo Vignoli, a well-known Free Software advocate and a marketing and public relations consultant, gives a presentation 
 on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/pandemicnowin/">"Why the pandemic could help FOSS, but was a win for proprietary software"</a>.
 </p>
 
<p>Christopher Klootz, a security expert, presents a talk on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/intlarbitration/">"A globally unified 
governance framework for Open Source - International arbitration to harmonize the security provisions of sovereign states and Open Source? 
The Java Virtual Machine, Ceph and abstraction layers"</a> at 14:00 CET.</p> 

<p>At 14.30 CET Vittorio Bertola, in charge for innovation and policy activities at Open-Xchange, gives a follow up on his talk from 
last year and will present <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/dma/">"An update on the Digital Markets Act - The 
new European rules for online competition"</a>.</p>

<p>Lucas Lasota, the FSFEs Legal Deputy Director, also follows up on his talk from last year and explains 
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/deviceneutrality/">"Why Device Neutrality is important for Free Software?"</a> at 15:00 CET.</p>

<p>To conclude the Legal and Policy Devroom, its organisers summarise the issues of the day and tackle some topics that have been missing on the agenda at 15:30 CET. </p>
