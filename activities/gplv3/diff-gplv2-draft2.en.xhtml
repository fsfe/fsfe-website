<p>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Discussion Draft 2 of</span> Version <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">2, June 1991</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">3, 27 July 2006</span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THIS IS A DRAFT, NOT A PUBLISHED VERSION OF THE GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.</span>
</p>

<p>
 Copyright (C) <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">1989, 1991</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">2006</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.      <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">59 Temple Place, Suite 330,</span>      <span style="font-weight: bold;">51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,</span> Boston, MA  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">02111-1307</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">02110-1301</span> USA  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
</p>

<p>
 			    Preamble 
</p>

<p>
   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">This</span>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU</span> General Public License <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">applies to</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">for</span> most of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the Free Software Foundation's software and</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">our software; it applies also</span> to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)</span>  You can apply it to your programs, too. 
</p>

<p>
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">programs;</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">programs,</span> and that you know you can do these things. 
</p>

<p>
   To protect your rights, we need to make <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">restrictions</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">requirements</span> that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">These restrictions translate to</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore, you have</span> certain responsibilities <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">for you</span> if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
</p>

<p>
   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. 
</p>

<p>
   <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">We</span> 
</p>

<p>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Developers that use the GNU GPL</span> protect your rights with two steps: (1) <span style="font-weight: bold;">assert</span> copyright <span style="font-weight: bold;">on</span> the software, and (2) offer you this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">license</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">License</span> which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. 
</p>

<p>
   <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Also, for each author's protection</span> 
</p>

<p>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">For the developers'</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains</span> that there is no warranty for this free software.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If the software is modified by someone else</span>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">For both users'</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">authors' sake,</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">original,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed,</span> so that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">any</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">their</span> problems <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">introduced by others</span> will not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">reflect on</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">be associated erroneously with</span> the original <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">authors' reputations.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">version. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Some computers are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the purpose of the GPL, which is to protect users' freedom to change the software.  Therefore, the GPL ensures that the software it covers will not be restricted in this way.</span> 
</p>

<p>
   Finally, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">any free</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">every</span> program is threatened constantly by software patents.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">We</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in places where they do, we</span> wish to avoid the <span style="font-weight: bold;">special</span> danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">we have made it clear</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">the GPL assures</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">any patent must</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">patents cannot</span> be <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. </span>

</p>

<p>
 		       TERMS AND CONDITIONS <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span> 
</p>

<p>
 0. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">This License applies</span>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Definitions. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   In this License, each licensee is addressed as "you," while "the Program" refers</span> to any <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">program or other</span> work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms</span> of <span style="font-weight: bold;">authorship licensed under</span> this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">General Public</span> License.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The "Program", below, refers to any such program</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">A "modified" work includes, without limitation, versions in which material has been translated</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work, and a "work based on the Program"</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">added.  A work "based on" another work means any modified version, formation of which requires permission under applicable copyright law.  A "covered work"</span> means either the <span style="font-weight: bold;">unmodified</span> Program or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">any derivative</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">a work based on the Program. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   To "propagate" a</span> work <span style="font-weight: bold;">means doing anything with it that requires permission</span> under <span style="font-weight: bold;">applicable</span> copyright <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">law:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">law, except executing it on a computer, or making modifications</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">is</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">you do not share.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">say,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">the public, and in some countries other activities as well.  To "convey"</span> a work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">containing</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies, excluding sublicensing. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   A party's "essential patent claims" in a work are all patent claims that</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">party can give permission to practice, whether already acquired</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">to be acquired, that would be infringed by making, using, or selling the work. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 1. Source Code. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   The "source code" for</span> a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">portion</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work means the preferred form</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">it, either verbatim or with</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">the work for making</span> modifications <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">to it.  "Object code" means any non-source version of a work. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include every subunit such that (a) the identical subunit</span> is <span style="font-weight: bold;">normally</span> included <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">without limitation</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">as an adjunct</span> in the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you". </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> Activities other than copying,</span> distribution <span style="font-weight: bold;">of either a major essential component (kernel, window system,</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">so on)</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">running</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program is not restricted,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">specific operating system (if any) on which the object code runs, or a compiler used to produce the object code, or an object code interpreter used to run it,</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">(b)</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">output</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">subunit (aside</span> from <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the Program is covered</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">possible incidental extensions) serves</span> only <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">to enable use</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">having been made by running</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program). Whether</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work with</span> that <span style="font-weight: bold;">system component or compiler or interpreter, or to implement a widely used or standard interface for which an implementation</span> is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">true depends on what the Program does. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">available to</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program's</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">public in</span> source code <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">as you receive it,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">form. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   The "Corresponding Source" for a work</span> in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">object code form means</span> all the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">notices that refer</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">source code needed</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">this License</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code</span> and to <span style="font-weight: bold;">modify</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">absence of any warranty;</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work, except its System Libraries,</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">give any other recipients</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">except general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part</span> of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program a copy of this License along</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes scripts used to control those activities, interface definition files associated</span> with the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">program source files,</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">the source code</span> for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a fee. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">   2. You may modify your copy or copies of</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work is specifically designed to require, such as by complex data communication</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">any portion</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">control flow between those subprograms and other parts</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">it, thus forming a work based on</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program, and copy and distribute such modifications</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   The Corresponding Source also includes any encryption</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work under</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">authorization keys necessary to install and/or execute modified versions from source code in</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">terms</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">recommended or principal context</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Section 1 above, provided</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">use, such</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">you also meet</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">they can implement</span> all <span style="font-weight: bold;">the same functionality in the same range</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">these conditions: </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">     a) You</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">circumstances.  (For instance, if the work is a DVD player and can play certain DVDs, it</span> must <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">cause</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">be possible for modified versions to play those DVDs.  If</span> the <span style="font-weight: bold;">work communicates with an online service, it must be possible for</span> modified <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">files</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">versions</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">carry prominent notices     stating that you changed</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">communicate with</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">files and</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">same online service in</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">date of any change. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">same way such</span> that <span style="font-weight: bold;">the service cannot distinguish.)  A key need not be included</span> in     <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">whole or in part contains or is derived from</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">cases where use of</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program or any     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third     parties under</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work normally implies</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">terms of this License. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">     c) If</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">user already has</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">modified program normally reads commands interactively     when run, you must cause</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">key and can read and copy</span> it, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">when started running for such     interactive use</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">as</span> in <span style="font-weight: bold;">privacy applications where users generate their own keys.  However,</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">most ordinary way, to print or display an     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">fact</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">you provide</span> a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under     these conditions, and telling</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">key is generated based on</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">user how to view a copy</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">object code</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">this     License.  (Exception: if</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program itself</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work or</span> is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">interactive but</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">present in hardware that limits its use</span> does not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">normally print such an announcement, your work based on</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">alter</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program is not required to print an announcement.) </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> These requirements apply</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">requirement</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold;">include it in</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">modified work</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Corresponding Source. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   The Corresponding Source may include portions which do not formally state this License</span> as <span style="font-weight: bold;">their license, but qualify under section 7 for inclusion in</span> a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">whole.  If identifiable sections of that</span> work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">are</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">under this License. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   The Corresponding Source need</span> not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">derived</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">include anything that users can regenerate automatically</span> from <span style="font-weight: bold;">other parts of</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Corresponding Source. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 2. Basic Permissions. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   All rights granted under</span> this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">License are granted for</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">same sections as part</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">term</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a whole which is a work based</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">copyright</span> on the Program, <span style="font-weight: bold;">and are irrevocable provided</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribution of the whole must be on</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">terms of</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">unmodified Program.  The output from running it is covered by</span> this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">License only if</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">entire whole, and thus</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of "fair use" or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   This License permits you</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">each</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">make</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">every part regardless</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">run privately modified versions</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">who wrote it. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> Thus, it is not</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">intent of this section to claim rights</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Program,</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">contest</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">have others make and run them on</span> your <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">behalf. However, this permission terminates, as</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">control the distribution</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">all such versions, if you bring suit against anyone for patent infringement</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">derivative or collective works based on the Program. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> In addition, mere aggregation</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">any</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">another</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">your essential patent claims in any such version, for making, using, selling or otherwise conveying a</span> work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">not</span> based on the Program <span style="font-weight: bold;">in compliance</span> with <span style="font-weight: bold;">this License. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Propagation of covered works other than conveying is permitted without limitation.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.  Conveying is permitted under</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program (or with a</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">conditions stated below. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 3. No Denying Users' Rights through Technical Measures. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Regardless of any other provision of this License, no permission is given for modes of conveying that deny users that run covered works the full exercise of the legal rights granted by this License. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   No covered</span> work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">based on</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">constitutes part of an effective technological "protection" measure under section 1201 of Title 17 of</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program) on</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">United States Code.  When you convey</span> a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">volume</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a storage</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">technical measures that include use of the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribution medium does not bring</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">modification of</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">other</span> work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">under</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">as a means of enforcing</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">scope</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">legal rights</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">this License. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">   3.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">third parties against the work's users. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 4.[1] Verbatim Copying.</span> 
</p>

<p>
  You may copy and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey verbatim copies of</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program (or a work based on</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Program's source code as you receive</span> it, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">under Section 2)</span> in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">any medium,</span> provided that you <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">also do one of the following: </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections     1</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">conspicuously</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">2 above</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">appropriately publish</span> on <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, </span>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">     b) Accompany it</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all license notices and notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients, along</span> with <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Program,</span> a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">written offer, valid for at least three     years, to give</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">copy of this License and the central list (if any) required by section 7.  The recipients of these copies will possess all the rights granted by this License (with</span> any <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">third party, for a</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">added terms under section 7). </span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 5.[2] Conveying Modified Source Versions. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   You may</span> copy <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">of</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">and convey a work based on</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">corresponding source code,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Program, or the modifications</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">be     distributed</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">produce it from the Program, in the form of source code</span> under the terms of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Sections 1</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">section 4 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     a) The modified work must carry prominent notices stating that you     changed the work</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">2 above on a medium     customarily used for software interchange; or, </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">     c) Accompany it with</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">information you received</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">date of any change. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     b) You must license the entire work,</span> as <span style="font-weight: bold;">a whole, under this     License</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the offer</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This     License must apply, unmodified except as permitted by section 7     below,</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is     allowed only for noncommercial distribution</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">the whole of the work,</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">only</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">all its parts, regardless of     how they are packaged.  This License gives no permission to     license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such     permission</span> if you <span style="font-weight: bold;">have separately</span> received <span style="font-weight: bold;">it. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     c) If</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">program in object code or executable form with such     an offer, in</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">modified work has interactive user interfaces, each must     include a convenient feature that displays an appropriate     copyright notice, and tells the user that there is no warranty for     the program (or that you provide a warranty), that users may     convey the modified work under this License, and how to view a     copy of this License together with the central list (if any) of     other terms in</span> accord with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Subsection b above.) </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> The source code</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">section 7.  Specifically, if the     interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a     menu, a command to display this information must be prominent in     the list; otherwise, the modified work must display this     information at startup.  However, if the Program has interactive     interfaces that do not comply with this subsection, your modified     work need not make them comply. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> To the extent that identifiable sections of the modified work, added by you, are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you convey them as separate works, not specifically</span> for <span style="font-weight: bold;">use in combination with the Program. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   A compilation of</span> a <span style="font-weight: bold;">covered</span> work <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">means</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">preferred</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">covered work, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">  6.[3] Conveying Non-Source Forms. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">    You may copy and convey a covered work in object code</span> form <span style="font-weight: bold;">under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     a) Convey the object code in a physical product (including a     physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding     Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for     software interchange. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     b) Convey the object code in a physical product (including a     physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer,     valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer     spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give     any third party a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the     software in the product that is covered by this License, on a     durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange,     for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically     performing this conveying of source. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     [b1) Convey the object code in a physical product (including a     physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer,     valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer     spare parts or customer support for that product model, to provide     access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at     no charge.] </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord     with subsection 6b or 6b1. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated     place, and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in     the same way through the same place at no extra charge.  You need     not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with     the object code. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     [If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the     Corresponding Source may be on a different server that supports     equivalent copying facilities, provided you have explicitly     arranged with the operator of that server to keep the     Corresponding Source available for as long as needed to satisfy     these requirements, and provided you maintain clear directions     next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding     Source.] </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission provided     you know that, and inform other peers where, the object code and     Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general     public at no charge under subsection 6d. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The Corresponding Source conveyed in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented, with an implementation available to the public in source code form, and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 7. Additional Terms. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   You may have received the Program, or parts of it, under terms that supplement the terms of this License.  These additional terms may include additional permissions, as provided in subsection 7a, and additional requirements, as provided in subsection 7b.  When you convey copies of a covered work, unless the work also permits use under a previous version of this License, it must list, in one central place in the source code, the complete set of additional terms governing all or part of the work. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   a. Additional Permissions. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Additional permissions make exceptions from one or more of the requirements of this License.  A license document containing a clause that permits relicensing or conveying under this License shall be treated as a list of additional permissions, provided that the license document makes clear that no requirement in it survives such relicensing or conveying. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Any additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program are treated as though they were included in this License, as exceptions to its conditions, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional terms. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   b. Additional Requirements.  </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Additional requirements are terms that further constrain use, modification or propagation of covered works.  This License affects only the procedure for enforcing additional requirements, and does not assert that they can be successfully enforced by the copyright holder. Only these kinds of additional requirements are allowed by this License: </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     0) terms that require preservation of specified reasonable legal        notices or author attributions; or </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     1) terms that require that the origin of the material they cover        not be misrepresented, or that modified versions of that        material be marked in specific reasonable ways as different        from the original version; or </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     2) warranty or liability disclaimers that differ from the        disclaimers in this License; or </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     3) terms that prohibit or limit the use for publicity purposes of        specified names of licensors or authors, or that require that        certain specified trade names, trademarks, or service marks not        be used for publicity purposes without express permission,        other than in ways that are fair use under applicable trademark        law; or </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     4) terms that require, if a modified version of the material they        cover is a work intended to interact with users through a        computer network, that those users be able to obtain copies of        the Corresponding Source of the work through the same network        session; or </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     5) terms that wholly or partially terminate, or allow termination        of, permission for use of the material they cover, for a user        who files a software patent lawsuit (that is, a lawsuit        alleging that some software infringes a patent) not filed in        retaliation or defense against the earlier filing of another        software patent lawsuit, or in which the allegedly infringing        software includes some of the covered material, possibly in        combination with other software; or </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">     6) terms that are precisely equivalent in type and extent to a        requirement expressly stated in this License, or that deny        permission for activities that are clearly not permitted,        expressly or otherwise, by this License. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> All other additional requirements, including attorney's fees provisions, choice of law, forum, and venue clauses, arbitration clauses, mandatory contractual acceptance clauses, requirements regarding changes to the name of the work, and terms that require that conveyed copies be governed by a license other than this License, are prohibited. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   c. Terms Added or Removed by You. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   When you convey a copy</span> of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">a covered</span> work, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">you may at your option remove</span> any <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">additional permissions from that copy, or from any part</span> of <span style="font-weight: bold;">it.  Some additional permissions require their own removal in certain cases when you modify</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">executable.  However,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">work. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Additional requirements are allowed only</span> as <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a special exception,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">stated in subsection 7b. If</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">source code distributed need not include anything</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Program as you received it purports to impose any other additional requirement, you may remove</span> that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">is normally distributed (in either source</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">requirement. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   You may place additional permissions,</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">additional requirements as allowed by subsection 7b,</span> on <span style="font-weight: bold;">material, added by you to a covered work, for</span> which <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> If distribution of executable</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">you have</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">object code is made</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">can give appropriate copyright permission. Adding requirements not allowed</span> by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">offering access</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">subsection 7b is a violation of this License that may lead to termination of your rights under section 8. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   If you add terms</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">copy from</span> a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">designated</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">covered work in accordance with this section, you must</span> place, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">then offering equivalent access to copy</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">in</span> the <span style="font-weight: bold;">relevant</span> source <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">code from the same place counts as distribution</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">files, a statement</span> of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">source code, even though third parties are not compelled</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">additional terms that apply</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">copy the source along with</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">those files, or a notice indicating where to find</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">object code. </span>

</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   8.[4] Termination.</span> 
</p>

<p>
   You may not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">copy, modify, sublicense,</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">propagate</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">modify</span> the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">copy, modify, sublicense</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">propagate</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">modify</span> the Program is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">void, and will automatically</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">void.  If you violate this License, any copyright holder may put you on notice by notifying you of the violation, by any reasonable means, provided 60 days have not elapsed since the last violation.  Having put you on notice, the copyright holder may then</span> terminate your <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">rights under this License.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">license at any time.</span>  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">as such parties</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">as they</span> remain in full compliance. 
</p>

<p>
   <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">5.</span> 
</p>

<p>
   <span style="font-weight: bold;">9.[5] Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</span> 
</p>

<p>
   You are not required to accept this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">License, since you have</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does</span> not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">signed it.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">require acceptance.</span>  However, nothing else grants you permission to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">modify</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">propagate</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">modify</span> the Program or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">its derivative</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">any covered</span> works.  These actions <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">are prohibited by law</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">infringe copyright</span> if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distributing</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">propagating</span> the Program (or any <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work based on the Program),</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">covered work),</span> you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">conditions for copying, distributing</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">conditions. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   10.[6] Automatic Licensing of Downstream Users. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License, including any additional terms introduced through section 7.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights thus granted</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">modifying</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">affirmed, except in</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">limited ways permitted by section 7. Therefore, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">works based</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   If propagation results from a transaction transferring control of an organization, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives a license and a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the party's predecessor in interest. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   11. Patents. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   You receive the Program with a covenant from each author and conveyor of the Program, and of any material, conveyed under this License,</span> on <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">it. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">   6. Each time you redistribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">which</span> the Program <span style="font-weight: bold;">is based, that the covenanting party will not assert</span> (or <span style="font-weight: bold;">cause others to assert)</span> any <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">of the party's essential patent claims in the material that the party conveyed, against you, arising from your exercise of rights under this License. If you convey a covered work, you similarly covenant to all recipients, including recipients of works</span> based on <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the Program), the recipient automatically receives</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">the covered work, not to assert any of your essential patent claims in the covered work. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on</span> a <span style="font-weight: bold;">non-sublicensable patent</span> license <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">from the original licensor</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">that is not generally available</span> to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">copy, distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">all, you must either (1) act to shield downstream users against the possible patent infringement claims from which your license protects you,</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">modify</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">(2) ensure that anyone can copy</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Corresponding Source of</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">recipients' exercise</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">covered work, free</span> of <span style="font-weight: bold;">charge and under</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">   7. If, as a consequence</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">terms</span> of <span style="font-weight: bold;">this License, through</span> a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">court judgment</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">publicly available network server</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">allegation of patent infringement</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">other readily accessible means. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">for</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">limiting</span> any <span style="font-weight: bold;">implied license or</span> other <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">reason (not limited</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold;">you under applicable</span> patent <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">issues),</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">law. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   12.[7] No Surrender of Others' Freedom. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">   If</span> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey the Program, or other covered work,</span> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system;</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">convey</span> it <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">is up to the author/donor to decide</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">at all.  For example,</span> if <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">he</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">you accept a patent license that prohibits royalty-free conveying by those who receive copies directly</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">she is willing to distribute software</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">indirectly</span> through <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">any other system</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">you, then the only way you could satisfy both it</span> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a licensee cannot impose that choice. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">this License would</span> be <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a consequence of</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">to refrain entirely from conveying</span> the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">rest of this License. </span>
