 <h1>Introducing FSFE's new president, vice president and executive team</h1>
 
 <p newsteaser="yes">During its General Assembly in Miraflores de la Sierra, Spain, the
members of FSFE elected new coordinators for several of the
organisation's activities, including strategy, legal and executive
coordination.</p>

<p>"The new team will continue FSFE's highly successful work with the
same long-term vision. We will work hard to justify the trust
which the Free Software community is putting into FSFE", says the
new president, Karsten Gerloff.</p>

<p>He continues: "Georg Greve and his team have done splendid work
over the past eight years, building FSFE out of nothing into an
organisation that is highly respected and trusted as an expert
group on Free Software, and as a reliable partner in policy making
and negotiations."</p>

<p>The newly elected Vice President Fernanda Weiden comments: "FSFE
has strong roots in the community. The people in this organisation
have a deep understanding not only of technology itself, but also
of its social and political aspects. Together, we can continue to
develop cutting-edge thinking on how we as a society handle
knowledge, and how we can best make the most of technology."</p>

<p>Christian Holz, appointed Executive Director, says: "Coming from a
business background and having worked with Free Software since the
early nineties, I am excited to become more involved in FSFE. The
team is highly motivated, and we have wonderful volunteers who
support our actions and cause."</p>

<p>Adriaan de Groot, FSFE's designated Freedom Task Force Coordinator:
"As Free Software has become mainstream, education and advice on its
legal aspects are getting more important every day. With the FTF, we
will continue to protect the interests of Free Software projects and
we stand ready to assist the community wherever our help may be
required."</p>

<p>Matthias Kirschner, newly hired to coordinate the Fellowship and the
German team, comments: "The Fellowship is key to building awareness
for Free Software in our society. It has become a magnet for smart,
dedicated people who care about Free Software, and an important
pillar for FSFE's financial stability. We will support FSFE's Fellows
and help them to make an impact wherever they are."</p>

<p>FSFE's founder and former president Georg Greve will remain in the
organisation as a volunteer. He expresses his full support for the new
team. "There is no doubt in my mind that these extraordinary people
are a dream team to ensure both continuity and change towards a
better, larger, and more successful FSFE. The past months of work to
prepare the ground with and for them have been a pleasure, and I look
forward to all the many achievements for software freedom this team is
going to bring about."</p>
