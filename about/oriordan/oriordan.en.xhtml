<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>Ciaran is a
  Brussels-based <a href="documents/freesoftware.en.html">Free
  Software</a> campaigner who has been working full-time for
  FSF-Europe since April 2005.</p>

<p>Before working for FSFE, he was a software developer and campaigned
  on copyright and patent related EU directives in his spare time.</p>

<p>He began working for FSFE during the large-scale campaigning
  against software patents.  He has also been involved in other
  legislative issues and policy meetings.  In 2006, he became active
  on spreading awareness of the GPLv3 public consultation process and
  the changes being made to the licence.</p>

<p>His focuses are on building awareness among the Free Software
  community about legal and legislative issues, and working to shape
  legislation and policy in the EU institutions to prevent software
  users and developers from having essential freedoms taken away.</p>
