      <p>Mid-August is FrOSCon time! The local FSFE group in Bonn is hosting a community get-together the evening before the big event. We will have some visitors from far away (does Berlin count as far away?).<br/>
This is also an opportunity if you can't make it to FrOSCon but still want to hang out. You are welcome either way!</p>
     <p>See you from 19.00 at Caf√© Bistro Pendel - reservation under Liv Dywan in case you can't find us!</p>
