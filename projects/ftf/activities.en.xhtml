        <h2>Special Interest Groups</h2>

        <p>
          We organize Special Interest Groups to discuss topics like
          business processes, license management and trademarks. These groups
	  are designed to reduce misunderstandings, share knowledge and address
	  areas where there is a lack of available guidance.
