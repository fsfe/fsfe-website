        <title>Upcycling Android workshop in Berlin</title>

    <body>
      <p>Together with the local FSFE group Berlin we are organizing our first Upcycling Android workshop on March 19th, 2022 in Berlin. This workshop is primarily about bringing tech enthusiasts and sustainability enthusiasts together and exchanging views on technology and sustainability while flashing phones with Free Software operating systems. We want to give a place for all questions you have and bring different phones to test different settings. We will bring devices with us on which you can try flashing phones or you can bring your own phones. In the case of the latter, we would ask you to clarify with us in advance whether the devices you have brought with you can be supported. </p>
      
      <p>In addition to the actual phone flashing, there will also be a short keynote speech on longevity and sustainability on Android and other devices. The keyone is in English, and the rest of the event will switch between English and German. We are on site for 6 hours and look forward to a large number of people coming. The venue is the Holodeck of Netzpolitik.org at Sch√∂nhauser Allee 6/7, from 11:00 to 17:00. Everyone is welcome to join, participation is free, no registration is needed.</p>
