    <title>[Blog] Final PDFreaders advertisement squashing</title>
	<body>

 <p>We currently wrap-up the PDFreaders campaign, and we need your help to
   measure our success. Started in 2009 FSFE’s goal with the campaign was to
   get rid of advertisement for proprietary PDF readers. We focused on the
   websites of public administrations, and many people helped us gather contact
   details for over 2000 public websites which advertised non-free software.
   Many people helped us to contact the public administrations, governments
   were made aware of it and published guidelines. Until now we know that 772
   of the 2110 bugs were fixed, which is a 36% success rate. But for most
   countries we did not check the status for several months now. That’s why we
   need your help now to make one final round. We are looking for volunteers
   who can help us checking websites in their native language, following the
   step-by-step guide in the blog post.</p>
