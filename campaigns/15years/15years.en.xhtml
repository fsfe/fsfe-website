      <!-- The FSFE is celebrating its 15th anniversary this year and we would
          like you to be part of it.-->

      Since its foundation in 2001 we have achieved many things. The FSFE has
      been instrumental in a successful antitrust-case against a big software
      corporation that was intent on dominating the market of personal
      computers; we have managed to maintain software patents unenforceable in
      Europe, avoiding a veritable apocalypse for small and medium-sized tech
      companies; and we have worked alongside gpl-violations.org to get free
      licenses vindicated in German courts of law, setting ground-breaking
      precedents for the whole of the EU. 
      You can find out more about the work we have carried out be visiting the
      <a href="/timeline/timeline.html">FSFE timeline</a>.

      <p>
	So we feel the need to celebrate. To do that we have organised a
        "<em>Get to know your Local Free Software Hero</em>" awareness
	campaign. The idea is we put community members in touch with the
	press in the region where you live. <em>Local heroes</em> can explain
	to journalists how the Free Software community affects the
	people near you, the benefits it has on education, the health system,
	the local economy and the lives of citizens in general.  If you are
	journalist, blogger, vlogger, podcaster, or a private citizen who can
  help us get in touch with a media outlet, big or small, <a href="/press/press.html">get in touch
    with us</a> and we'll tell you who your local heroes
	are and how to meet them.
      </p>


      <p>
	The 15th anniversary theme will also feature prominently in our
        <a href="/community/events/2016/summit/frontpage">2016 summit</a>.
        We are holding our summit from 2 - 4 of September in Berlin this year,
	and we would like you to come. We have a
	<a href="/community/events/2016/summit/frontpage#business">first
	class line up of speakers</a> and we will be covering all the
	pressing topics concerning Free Software in Europe and the
	world. So <a href="/communty/events/2016/summit/">save you
	place</a> by signing up on our
	<a href="https://conf.qtcon.org/en/session/new?conference_acronym=qtcon">registration page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
	But probably the most important thing you can do to make this year
	important for us is become a Fellow. If you would like to support us
	directly and become part of the FSFE please sign up 
	<a href="/join">as sustaining member now</a>.
	There are no fixed fees, you can adjust it to what is convenient to
	you, and whatever you choose will help us keep software free.
      </p>

      <p>So, <a href="/join">become a sustaining member</a>, spread the word, and <a
        href="/community/events/2016/summit/frontpage">come to our event</a>!
      Whatever you choose will help us to empower users to control
      control technology.
      </p>
