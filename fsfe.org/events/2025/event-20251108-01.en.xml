      <p>In the realm of Free Software, expressing gratitude towards Free Software contributors often goes unnoticed. The [“I Love Free Software Day”] (https://ilovefs.org) provides a platform for individuals and organisations to do exactly this, showing appreciation. But it is crucial to recognize that our appreciation for Free Software should extend far beyond this single day. In this talk, Ana Galán highlights the significance of the “I Love Free Software Day” as a platform for expressing support, love, and gratitude towards the developers and contributors who make Free Software possible.</p>
     <p>Throughout the presentation, we will showcase memorable moments and successful initiatives from past celebrations, demonstrating the collective efforts to acknowledge and honor the impact of Free Software.  We will discuss ideas and strategies for making the upcoming “I Love Free Software Day” even more remarkable.</p>
     <p>However, it is essential to emphasize that our expressions of love and support for Free Software should not be limited to just one day. While the “I Love Free Software Day” serves as a catalyst for celebration, it should inspire us to continue demonstrating our gratitude throughout the year. We will explore ways to incorporate ongoing appreciation into our daily lives, such as contributing to Free Software projects, advocating for their importance, and recognizing the efforts of developers and contributors regularly also in a financial way.</p>
     <p>By extending our appreciation beyond a single day, we can cultivate a culture of continuous support for Free Software. We invite everyone interested in Free Software to join us in this endeavor, as we strive to create an environment where gratitude and acknowledgment become integral parts of our interactions within the Free Software community.</p>

      <p>Public procurement is more than an administrative process: it can serve as a powerful lever for reducing vendor lock-in and strengthening technological sovereignty across Europe. For this, a Free Software First approach is needed. But how can Free Software be procured without rewarding freeloaders and openwashers? Introducing and applying award criteria beyond price is essential for this.</p>
     <p>Simply prioritising Free Software in tenders can incentivise some vendors to openwash proprietary products or undercut providers who actually develop and maintain Free Software by selling code they did not create or support themselves, without contributing back to the original developers. Such destructive market behaviour will not lead to technological sovereignty and also harms the Free Software ecosystem, undermining the intended benefits of fair procurement.</p>
     <p>In this talk, Johannes Näder will discuss how public administrations can detect and mitigate these practices by introducing effective and fair procurement criteria — a topic the Free Software Foundation Europe has been working on intensively in recent years. We will also explore how the upcoming EU procurement directive reform could support this shift and how it should be designed to advance Europe’s technological sovereignty through Free Software and the “Public Money? Public Code!” principle.</p>
