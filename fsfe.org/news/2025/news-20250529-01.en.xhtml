	<h1>No more imposed licensing - Get back the cost of your Windows License!</h1>

<p>
When acquiring a new laptop you often end up dealing with an imposed 
pre-installed Microsoft Windows operating system. Even if you do not 
want to use it, you still need to pay for the Windows license. This is 
unfair. The Refund4Freedom initiative guides users in how to get 
their money back in these cases and demands the end of this practice 
that limits user freedom.

<p>As a user, you have most likely encountered the
issue that most laptops are being sold with a pre-installed
Windows operating system. While this alone might seem like a minor
inconvenience, it becomes problematic as the cost of the Microsoft
Windows license is bundled in without an effective and easy way for consumers to opt out.</p>

<p>This standardized practice not only adds extra costs for the consumers, if they do not want
that pre-installed software, but also comes with another issue: the
hardship of saying no to it and getting a refund. Forcing consumers to 
buy software every time they acquire a new device
without the possibility to reject the software bundling is against
<a
href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index">Device
Neutrality</a>. Besides it is illegal
when manufacturers do not allow consumers to recover the licensing
costs of unused software.</p>

<h3>Time to change: join our Refund4Freedom
initiative!</h3>
<p>Joining forces with the Italian Linux Society (ILS),
the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) has launched an initiative to
protect consumer rights when buying a new computer. <a
href="https://refund4freedom.org/">Refund4Freedom</a> aims to:</p>

<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Help consumers to get a refund of the cost of the
Windows
License when buying a new device.
</li>
<li>
Provide information on how device manufacturers deal
with refund queries.
</li>
<li>
Raise awareness against imposed software bundling in
devices.
</li>
<li>
Demand from device manufacturers better refund
policies and procedures.
</li>
<li>
Protect the right to use only the software of one's choice.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Refund4Freedom is one of a broader set of activities promoting end-users' rights. For instance, the <a 
href="https://endof10.org/">End of 10 campaign</a> encourages 
users to 
keep using their current hardware by switching to Free Software 
operating systems. This offers an alternative to buying a new device 
when support for Windows 10 ends on 14 October 2025. By demanding 
refunds for unwanted pre-installed software, Refund4Freedom supports 
this transition and helps users avoid unnecessary costs while encouraging
device neutrality and user-controlled choices.
</p>

<h3>Let us exercise Software Freedom together </h3>
<p>
Next time you buy a computer with pre-installed Windows, make sure to
join our initiative and do not be shy to request a refund! <a 
href="mailto:%20contact@fsfe.org">Share your experience with us</a> and
together let us demand respect for our software freedom!
</p>

<p>
Although Refund4Freedom focuses on Italy for now, we are building
experience to expand our efforts to the rest of Europe. Therefore, your
contributions will help us push this agenda for everyone!!

"You should not have to pay for software you do not
want. Manufacturers and vendors have no right to impose specific
operating systems on users, nor should they obscure the cost of those
licenses in the final price of the device",<cite> states Lucas Lasota,
Refund4Freedom co-coordinator</cite>. 
</blockquote>

<h3>Get inspired! A tenacious example of license refund in Italy</h3>
<p>Refund4Freedom is inspired by the relentless work of volunteers
facing great challenges to enforce their rights in exercising software
freedom. A dramatic example is the <a href="/news/2021/news-20210302-01.html">victorious
story</a> of Luca Bonnissi, an FSFE supporter from Italy and
professional developer, against the giant computer manufacturer Lenovo
in Italian courts.</p>

<p>The practice of increasing the price of the hardware by including a 
bundle Windows license is not new; depending on the manufacturer, 
dealing with it can
be a long and quite frustrating process. In 2018, Luca filed a request
to Lenovo for the refund of the cost of the pre-installed Windows license in his
new Lenovo Ideapad convertible laptop. </p>

  alt="Illustration of a hand removing what looks like a Windows logo sticker partially covering the word Freedom. All is white with a blue background "/>
</figure>	

<p>What started as an easy consumer rights request ended up in a 
bureaucratic and legal quest which took years, several court
proceedings, and much resilience and determination from Luca. In the
end, the court confirmed the right to reimbursement for the pre-installed
software and the decision pointed out that the manufacturer itself had
expressly assumed this obligation in the Windows license. </p>

<p>But that is not all: in a historic decision, <a href="/news/2021/news-20210302-01.html">the court
imposed upon Lenovo punitive damages amounting to 20,000 euros for abuse
of the appeal procedures</a>: Lenovo forced its customer to take part in
a disproportionate and unnecessary legal process.</p>

<p>This decision marked a significant victory against the questionable
commercial practices of tech companies of obstructing consumers from
obtaining refunds for pre-installed proprietary software. However, it
also underlined a harsh reality: while consumers may legally have the
right to a refund, the actual cost of asserting that right remains high.</p>

<p>A few manufacturers have defined better policies and clearer
procedures for requesting and obtaining refunds. But for others, consumers are
forced to engage in persistent correspondence and, in many cases, take
legal action as a last resort. These companies often use their position
of power to discourage individuals who do not have the time and resources
to be involved in a drawn-out litigation just for a Windows license
refund.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://refund4freedom.org/">Refund4Freedom initiative
</a>is showcasing successful cases and documentation in Italy to help
computer users who want to exercise their rights and request a refund.
Beyond offering practical tools, the initiative aims to ensure that
consumers donâ€™t feel alone in this process, by empowering them with
	knowledge and guidance, that manufacturers should not impose
	specific operating systems on them.</p>
