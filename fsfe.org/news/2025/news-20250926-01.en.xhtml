	<p>
	In 2025 we remained engaged in 
	enforcing the DMA, intervening in the Apple vs EC legal case; we 
	participated in the debates around the CRA 
	and public procurement to ensure that Free Software is
	embedded in Europe’s digital future. Also, we continued providing legal 
	support and improved REUSE, while involving teenagers with YH4F, and we 
	reached new audiences with the new Ada &amp; Zangemann 
	movies.

	<p>As we look towards the year 2048, we know the kind of world we are 
	aiming for. <a href="/news/2025/news-20250103-01.html">Our vision for 2048 is clear</a>: a world where 
	everyone has the
	right to remove and install any software on any device, where public
	funding for software is exclusively allocated to Free Software, and
	where regulatory frameworks actively encourage the development and use
	of Free Software. A 
	world in which young people have the opportunity to tinker, experiment 
	and code
	with Free Software as the default and Free Software contributors should be able
	to focus on contributing to society without constantly worrying about
	legal issues. In 2025, we took significant strides toward this vision.</p>

	<p>In the realm of Device Neutrality, we advanced our case against Apple
	at the European Court of Justice, challenging restrictive practices that
	hinder user choice. Simultaneously, we celebrated Germany's confirmation
	of Router Freedom, a victory that empowers users to choose their own 
	router hardware. In Italy, our coalition work influenced fiber
	network regulations, ensuring they protect end-user rights.</p>
	<p>Legal support and education remained at the forefront of our
	initiatives. We updated the REUSE specification and tools, launched the
	Legal Corner column, continued helping with legal questions and achieved another
	edition of the Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop (LLW), while continue being active in the NGI
	consortium. </p>

	<p>Engaging the next generations, we hosted the fourth edition of Youth 
	Hacking 4 Freedom, programming contest and inspired teenagers across 
	Europe to
	create innovative Free Software projects. With "Ada &amp; Zangemann - A 
	Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream" we continued to 
	captivate young minds, with the animated movie
	reaching audiences worldwide, while adding more translations and
	reaching to more and more children through readings and events. </p>
	<p>We were actively participating in discussions around
	the AI Act, Cyber Resilience Act, and public procurement, emphasizing
	the importance of integrating Free Software principles into legislative
	frameworks shaping markets that benefit Free Software users and 
	developers. We continued working on our "Public Money? Public Code!" 
	framework, including an event for local governments.</p>

	<p>Community engagement flourished through various events and outreach
	activities. We celebrated the "I Love Free Software Day" with events in
	multiple countries, highlighting the often-overlooked Free Software
	projects that power our daily lives. Our presence at conferences such as
	FOSDEM, SFSCON, DevConf.CZ, etc. facilitated meaningful discussions and
	strengthened our network.</p>

	<p>Behind the scenes, our technical team enhanced infrastructure
	resilience, optimized website performance, and improved accessibility,
	ensuring that our digital infrastructure effectively serve our growing
	community. This year, we bid farewell to our office space at 
	Schönhauser Allee after many years of having it as our home base. The 
	generous donation of the Software Freedom Flat (SFF) by Reinhard 
	Wiesemann and our move there, marks a pivotal 
	moment, as it provides dedicated spaces for the FSFE's team and 
	volunteers for living there and collaborating with each other.</p>

	</figure>


	<p>Reflecting on these accomplishments, we are reminded that the journey
	toward our 2048 vision is a collective effort. It is through the
	dedication of our supporters, volunteers, and partners that we continue
	to make meaningful progress. Together, we are shaping a future where
	software freedom is a reality for all.</p>

	<h2 id="device-neutrality">Device Neutrality</h2>

	<p>The FSFE’s work on the Digital Markets Act (DMA) has been twofold.
	Since the beginning of 2024, we have intervened in a key case before the
	Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) involving Apple and the
	European Commission. At the same time, we have actively contributed to
	the implementation of the DMA, working to ensure it is applied in a
	developer-friendly way that empowers Free Software developers and
	strengthens Free Software in general.</p>

	<p>The FSFE remains the only civil society organisation engaged in 
	private enforcement of the DMA, <a href="/activities/apple-litigation/apple-litigation.html">intervening 
	for Free 
	Software in a key court case involving Apple and the European 
	Commission</a>. Apple is trying to avoid obligations derived from the 
	Digital Markets Act (DMA). The FSFE seeks to hold Apple accountable 
	under the DMA in a developer-friendly way. </p>

	<p>In summer 2024, the CJEU granted the FSFE the right to intervene in
	the proceedings. By September 2024, we had submitted our legal arguments
	to the Court, and we now await its decision.</p>

	<p><strong>Regulatory Intervention to protect Free Software and Interoperability
	</strong></p>

	<p>Alongside litigation, the FSFE has engaged proactively with the DMA’s
	regulatory processes. By the end of 2024, we had begun a comprehensive
	<a href="https://kgi.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Lucas-Lasota.pdf">study</a> 
	on how Apple’s restrictive interoperability policies harm Free
	Software. The findings were first presented in November 2024 during a
	conference on DMA implementation in Brussels, and later  <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/jnePaxjd9PD4nLHzTDzEqw">in the DMA and 
	Beyond Conference</a> 
	organised by the Knight-Georgetown Institute and Yale University in
	Washington, D.C., in February 2025.</p>

	<p>In January 2025, the FSFE <a href="/news/2025/news-20250116-01.html">joined civil society 
	organisations</a>,
	developers, and researchers in submitting a position to the European
	Commission’s public consultation on Apple’s compliance with the DMA’s
	interoperability requirements. We stressed the urgent need for Apple to
	provide effective and free-of-charge interoperability. Following nearly
	a year of regulatory dialogue, the Commission concluded its
	specification procedure on Apple’s compliance with Article 6(7),
	covering both software and hardware interoperability. Throughout this
	process, the FSFE provided <a href="https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ARTICLE-19_Joint-submission_EC_PUBLIC-CONSULTATION_APPLE_ARTICLE-67.pdf">technical 
	analyses</a>, academic research, and
	active contributions to consultations, while also building a coalition
	of Free Software projects directly affected by Apple’s policies.</p>

	<p>Although the Commission stopped short of requiring interoperability
	by design, its final decision reflects many of our arguments. Developers
	now benefit from greater clarity, including a timeline for Apple’s
	responses to interoperability requests and an appeal mechanism to
	challenge Apple’s decisions. Apple must compete on innovation rather
	than imposing unilateral security standards.</p>

	<blockquote><cite>"The FSFE has ensured that the voices of Free Software developers,
	particularly smaller projects, are heard. We welcome the European
	Commission’s steps toward demanding effective and transparent measures
	from Apple, but a fundamental shift towards "interoperability by design"
	would be the most impactful improvement. DMA is not only about
	regulating competition among gatekeepers but also levelling the playing
	field to SMEs and smaller software developers. Therefore, it is crucial
	to keep Apple’s approach to interoperability under strict scrutiny from
	the Commission and civil society." </cite>Lucas Lasota, FSFE Legal
	Programme Manager</blockquote>

	<p>To continue monitoring how gatekeepers implement their
	interoperability obligations and to ensure that Free Software is not
	harmed, the FSFE launched the <a href="news/2025/news-20250618-01.html">Interoperability Survey</a>. This 
	initiative
	collects structured feedback from Free Software developers, referred to
	as “access seekers”, about their experiences when requesting
	interoperability under Article 6(7) DMA. The survey aims to foster
	innovation and support alternative solutions developed by the Free
	Software community. Developers who have submitted, or plan to submit, an
	interoperability request are encouraged to participate.</p>

	<p>In addition to legal and regulatory engagement, the FSFE has worked
	to raise awareness about the importance of the DMA and its
	implementation. Over the past year, we have contributed to conferences
	and events across Europe, produced an <a href="/news/podcast/episode-30.html">episode of the Software
	Freedom Podcast</a>, and organised two workshops. One of these
	workshops was dedicated to <a href="/news/2025/news-20250306-01.html">Free Software organisations</a>, 
	while the other
	was hosted by the German Open Source Business Alliance, where we
	highlighted the <a href="https://osb-alliance.de/featured/big-tech-vs-small-tech-wie-der-digital-markets-act-interoperabilitaet-open-source-und-einen-fairen-wettbewerb-staerken-kann">DMA’s 
	potential for Free Software companies</a>.</p>

	
	<h4><br/>Successes for Router Freedom</h4>

	<p>2025 has been a successful year for Router Freedom. Our work in this
	field collected victories in Germany and extended interventions in
	regulatory processes in Italy. More and more users can enjoy the freedom
	to use their own equipment to connect to the internet, run Free Software
	on their devices and get rid of internet providers’ lock-ins!</p>

	<p>In Germany, after 10 years the regulator Bundesnetzagentur has
	finally <a href="/news/2025/news-20250124-01.html">confirmed
	Router Freedom in the country</a>. After a failed attempt by internet
	providers to exclude Router Freedom from fiber networks, the Bundesnetzagentur rejected all
	the arguments brought forward by the telecom operators, explaining in
	detail why freedom of terminal equipment is crucial for end-users. The
	FSFE has been pushing for this since 2013, submitted a <a href="/news/2023/news-20230915-01.html">detailed
	position paper</a> debunking the arguments of the fiber operators. We
	have demonstrated that Router Freedom represents freedom of choice,
	security, consumer welfare, fair competition and sustainability.</p>

	<div class="standout-text-bggreen">Want to learn the history of Router
	Freedom in Europe? Check our <a href="/news/podcast/episode-32.html">SFP#32
	podcast</a> to learn how the FSFE has been defending your right to use
	your router for more than a decade in the EU! </div> 

	<p>In Italy, the situation remains challenging, but we work hard to achive 
	the best outcome for end users. Although the country was among
	the first to introduce Router Freedom for DSL connections in 2018, the
	national regulator AGCOM later introduced exceptions that weakened this
	right for fiber networks. In 2024, we worked with a coalition of
	organizations and volunteers to demand a formal regulatory process.</p>

	<p>This effort brought a considerable victory in February 2025, when
	AGCOM’s consumer division launched a regulatory process to decide
	whether consumers can freely choose their own routers and modems for
	fiber connections. During the public consultation, t<a href="/news/2025/news-20250331-01.html">he FSFE
	mobilized a broad coalition of stakeholders</a> (including civil
	society, industry representatives, hacker spaces, and Linux User Groups)
	and submitted <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/routers/fsfe-agcom-en-25.pdf">a
	comprehensive study defending users’ rights.</a> While a final decision
	is still pending, we continue to monitor developments closely.</p>

	</figure>
		
	<p>On the European level, Router Freedom continues to be a priority for
	the telecom sector. Several topics are still unclear and will require
	further analysis and commitment to public awareness and education
	towards decision makers. For instance, Router Freedom is not currently
	guaranteed in <a href="https://defcon.social/@llas/114896429530737590">satellite
	networks</a>, and the diverse cross EU legislation for <a href="/activities/radiodirective/index.html">cybersecurity
	in radio equipment</a> will led to further restrictions imposed on
	end-users. </p>


	<h4><br/>Refund4Freedom - reclaim the costs of unwanted Windows licenses</h4>

	<p>In 2025, consumers still face the widespread practice of being forced
	to purchase computers bundled with Microsoft Windows, without the option
	to refuse the license or obtain a refund. This situation obliges users
	to pay for software they may not wish to use, restricting their freedom
	of choice. <a href="/news/2025/news-20250529-01.html">The FSFE said
	Basta</a>!</p>

	<p>Together with the Italian Linux Society (ILS), we launched the <a href="https://refund4freedom.org/">Refund4Freedom initiative</a>. The 
	project supports consumers in reclaiming the cost of
	unwanted Windows licenses, documents manufacturers’ refund practices,
	and raises awareness about unlawful software bundling. It also advocates
	for fairer policies from hardware vendors, ensuring that users can
	freely choose their preferred operating system.</p>

	</figure>	

<p>With Microsoft ending support for Windows 10 in 2025, the initiative
	also underscores the opportunity for users to adopt a GNU/Linux
	distribution. In this context, the FSFE supports <a href="https://endof10.org/">the End of
	10 campaign</a>. For example, since spring 2025, the
	FSFE’s Berlin group has been organizing regular “End of 10 Install
	Parties,” in cooperation with other local actors. These events provide
	users with guidance on migrating to GNU/Linux distributions and offer
	support in addressing their questions. Other FSFE groups are also active
	on this issue, and a dedicated FSFE Matrix room provides further
	information and coordination. </p>


	<h4><br/>Free Your Android</h4>

	<p>Since 2012, we have been running <a href="/activities/android/android.html">the Free Your Android 
	initiative</a> to
	help Android users reclaim control over their devices and data,
	encouraging the use of Free Software apps and operating systems, and
	highlighting how people can switch to or support alternatives that
	respect user freedom. As an long running activity, we have been
	monitoring the situation there, and talked about it at our booths or at workshops, such as the one
	that took place last spring in a library in Berlin or at Devconf.cz. </p>

	<p>In the last months Free Software on Android phones is facing serious
	challenges. With current
	versions of Android, Google delays publication of the source code and
	completely withholds crucial components like hardware specific code for
	their own devices. This significantly complicates ROM development for
	anyone who does not directly partner with Google, so especially Free
	Software ROM developers. At the same time, Google is trying to restrict
	developer access in general by requiring registration, further worsening
	the situation for software freedom on phones. At the same time, CalyxOS
	has announced that they cannot provide software updates until further
	notice and it's still unclear how this situation will resolve.</p>

	<p>The FSFE is responding proactively by closely engaging with
	developers and other stakeholders to safeguard freedom and privacy on
	phones. We are also in the process of updating our Free Your Android
	pages to reflect the changed landscape. This will make sure we provide
	clear, up to date advice to help users choose software that ensures
	long-term freedom.</p>

	<p>We also hope that EU regulations such as the DMA will help in this
	respect.</p>


	<h4><br/>REUSE - make licensing easy for humans and machines alike</h4>

	<p>We end up 2024 with the release of the <a href="/news/2024/news-20241114-01.html">REUSE
	Specification 3.3 and REUSE tool 5.0.0,</a> making it even easier to
	license your code as Free Software. REUSE provides all the tools and
	documentation that developers need to apply standards-compliant and
	comprehensive licensing information to their projects, without needing
	to be a legal expert. </p>

	<p><a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> continues to evolve thanks to steady input from a vibrant
	global community, both in the form of issues, code contributions, and
	general feedback. This year presented an unexpected challenge when the
	primary maintainer had to temporarily step down due to illness. Although
	these kinds of transitions are never easy, we did our best to make it as
	smooth as possible and the software remains in capable hands.</p>
	
	<figure>
  	<peertube url="https://media.fsfe.org/w/nLQzeELdf13Hx2HSYBCEPE"/>
	</figure>
	
	<p>A major success this year was the move of Arch to adopt REUSE. In <a href="vector://vector/webapp/REUSE(https://rfc.archlinux.page/0052-reuse/)">RFC
	52</a>, the developers propose using REUSE for license annotation in
	their packaging. This step by a major distribution is a great example of
	how REUSE helps by providing machine-readable licensing information and
	simplifying processes.</p>

	<p>The REUSE tool plays a crucial
	role in ensuring that NGI (Next Generation Internet)
	projects comply with Free Software licensing best
	practices. REUSE provides a simple, standardized method to embed
	machine-readable licensing information directly into project files,
	making it easy for both humans and automated systems to verify
	compliance. This clarity fosters trust among collaborators, funders, and
	end users, and it significantly lowers the barriers to adoption and
	reuse of NGI results.</p>

	<p>In the last months, we have actively continue supporting NGI projects
	in adopting REUSE by offering direct advice, training materials, and
	guidance on implementation. Through workshops, documentation, and
	consultations, we help project teams understand the importance of
	licensing clarity and how to apply the REUSE standard to their own work.
	</p>

	<h2 id="free-software-markets">Free Software Markets and
	PMPC</h2>

	<p>In <a href="/news/2024/news-20240920-01.html">Software
	Freedom in Europe 2024</a>, we warned about the European Commission’s plans to cut funding for NGI
	projects. As we 
	highlighted in a statement in November 2024, <a href="/news/2024/news-20241113-01.html">the European
	Commission’s recurring uncertainty around budget allocations underscores
	how fragile essential Free Software support remains</a>. Without
	predictable, long-term public investment, projects that underpin
	Europe’s digital autonomy risk being left dependent on fragmented or
	short-lived sources of funding. The future of our digital independence 
	requires stable and sustainable financial backing, not on short-term
	funding that can vanish with the next budget draft. For years, the FSFE
	has highlighted how Free Software is key for the backbone of Europe’s
	digital infrastructure, and through our <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money? Public Code!</a> initiative
	we have shown how making publicly funded software available as Free
	Software strengthens that backbone by ensuring transparency,
	reusability, and independence. The past year has shown that ensuring its
	resilience requires long-term, structural funding
	commitments.</p>

	<p>Over the past year, we have been advocating for this. At <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/s5tMs6YzbM4zBt3qo2acUC">SFSCON
	2024 in Bolzano </a>and at the <a href="https://www.opensouthcode.org/conferences/opensouthcode2025/program/proposals/941">OpenSouth
	Code in Málaga in 2025,</a> we had underlined that
	Free Software requires permanent funding structures. In collaboration
	with other stakeholders, FSFE co-organized the <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/p/9ahYpCXQvxnTkf1aEJund9">FOSS
	Funding devroom at FOSDEM 2025</a>, where developers,
	funders, and policymakers discussed the future of financial support for
	Free Software projects.</p>
	
	<figure>
	  <peertube url="https://media.fsfe.org/w/s5tMs6YzbM4zBt3qo2acUC"/>
	</figure>

	<p>Beyond conferences, we has also worked to broaden the conversation
	through our communication channels. In <a href="/news/podcast/episode-26.html">episode 26 of
	the Software Freedom Podcast</a>, we explored the systemic funding
	challenges Free Software faces, offering insights into why public
	institutions and governments must guarantee stable support rather than
	relying solely on voluntary or market-driven contributions. This
	perspective was further reinforced by the FSFE’s official <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/202505_EU_long_term_budget_Consultation_Statement_FSFE.pdf">contribution
	to the EU’s long-term budget consultation</a>, where the organization
	called for a dedicated, structural funding line for Free Software at the
	European level.</p>

	<p>Sustainable funding must also be accompanied by better public procurement practices.
	Currently, many EU institutions and national administrations still
	default to proprietary vendors, locking themselves into costly and
	inflexible contracts. By prioritising Free Software, Europe could ensure
	that public money is invested in solutions that remain reusable,
	transparent, and accessible to all. </p>

	<blockquote><cite>“Gaining control over technology is one of the pressing topics
	for the European Union. Reducing dependencies and removing vendor
	lock-ins is key to achieving this, and only the four freedoms of Free
	Software to use, study, share, and improve the code allow it. A Free
	Software first policy must facilitate easy procurement of Free Software
	solutions while fostering collaboration between Member States.
	Implementation also needs to be well-executed. Furthermore, reliable
	long-term funding for Free Software core infrastructure and security is
	needed to ensure digital and technological sovereignty. Unfortunately
	the report lacks concrete measures and requirements that need to be
	improved before the plenary vote.” </cite>states Alexander Sander, FSFE Senior
	Policy Consultant. </blockquote>

	<p>In June 2025 the Industry Committee voted on procurement to focus on
	interoperable solutions, and pointing to the benefits of Free Software
	in fostering competitiveness and innovation thanks to its global
	character, although its report lacked of concrete measures. Further
	insights into this issue were discussed in <a href="/news/podcast/episode-34.html">Software Freedom
	Podcast episode 34</a> and in <a href="/news/podcast/episode-35.html">the episode
	35,</a> where we provided an in-depth analysis of the EU's Tech
	Sovereignty vote, highlighting the critical role of Free Software in
	achieving technological independence. On the other hand, we contributed
	with a <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/202503_Public_procurement_directives_Evaluation_Statement_FSFE.pdf">statement
	to the EC consultation</a> on this topic.</p>

	<p>This is precisely the vision behind <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money? Public Code!</a>: software
	paid for by the public should serve the public. Combining structural
	funding with Free Software–friendly procurement would provide not only
	the financial security but also the political framework needed for
	Europe to fully reclaim control over its digital infrastructure.</p>

	<p>During these months, we have also continued our engagement with key
	European regulations, particularly the Cyber Resilience
	Act (CRA) and the AI Act. As part of the <a href="https://www.dialog-cybersicherheit.de/workstreams/">Dialogue on
	Cybersecurity project</a>, the FSFE and the Federal Office for
	Information Security (BSI) are working are working together with
	representatives from civil society, academia, industry and public
	authorities in a project on the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and its
	implication for Free Software. through expert talks, a <a href="/news/2025/news-20250717-01.html">questionnaire to call
	for CRA stewards for their active input</a>, and talks at <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/miJY9odhtHi6Q8Zpz8SGca">FrOSCon 2025</a>
	and another at <a href="https://talks.datenspuren.de/ds25/talk/SSPWGZ/">Datenspuren
	2025</a>. </p>

	<p>On the AI Act, we were advocating for strong
	safeguards and transparent governance of AI systems in Europe. The <a href="/news/podcast/episode-36.html">episode 36 of
	the Software Freedom Podcast </a>discusses our call on
	the European Commission to implement the AI Act in ways that respect
	Free Software. </p>

		<p>While these examples show up our ongoing commitment to ensuring that
	emerging EU regulations both protect digital rights and empower the Free
	Software ecosystem, reinforcing Europe’s technological independence and
	resilience, we are also working to help people and organisations
	understand how Free Software fosters freedom, transparency, and
	self-determination, and to encourage its use and development. To this
	end, we <a href="/news/2025/news-20250409-01.html">organised the
	symposium “Public Money? Public Code! in practice”</a> in Essen
	in April 2025, with a focus on public administrations – especially
	municipalities. Experts from politics, public administration, business,
	academia, and civil society discussed why Free Software is indispensable
	for digital sovereignty, how effective procurement can work, what
	resources are needed, and how administrations can proactively move
	forward.</p>

	</figure>

	<p>Building on this success, we piloted and launched a new <em>Public
	Money? Public Code!</em> activity for volunteers across Europe. With a
	blueprint now in place, the next edition is planned for Denmark in 2026.
	We invite volunteers in other countries to bring the symposium to their
	local context – and we are ready to support with project planning, topic
	selection, speakers, implementation, and communication.</p>

	<h4><br/>"Public Money? Public Code!" in Germany</h4>
	<p>At the end of 2024, Germany’s coalition collapsed without fulfilling
	promises to advance Free Software in public administration. A Bundestag
	hearing shortly before the elections gave us the opportunity to
	contribute <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/policy/20241204_Bundestag_Hearing_FSFE_en.pdf">strong
	arguments for Free Software to the parliamentary record</a> and to warn
	against openwashing. Our <a href="/news/podcast/episode-27.html">#SFP27
	podcast</a> looks more closely at the hearing and explains our
	position.</p>

	<p>The FSFE monitored the election period and the formation of the new
	CDU/CSU–SPD government: We <a href="/news/2025/news-20250206-01.html">called on
	parties </a>to commit to “Public Money? Public Code!”, secure long-term
	funding for Free Software, deepen administrative Free Software
	knowledge, and monitor progress.Consequently, the coalition agreement announced
	ambitious goals for Free Software, <a href="/news/podcast/episode-33.html"> but failed to offer details
	or measures</a>.</p>

	<p>To this day, it remains unclear what these goals are and what role Free Software
	will play for Germany’s technological sovereignty. Despite promises to 
	make Free Software the guiding principle of 
	digital infrastructure, the current federal budget and the procurement
	reform missed key opportunities to advance Free Software. Whether the planned stack will consistently rely
	on Free Software and ensure European interoperability also remains 
	uncertain. After the government’s first 100 days,
	we pointed out these shortcomings <a href="/news/2025/news-20250814-01.html">in
	a detailed analysis</a> and made clear: Germany and Europe need Free Software –
	the time to act is now!</p>


	<h4><br/>MP Explore to reach representatives</h4>
	<p>In order to streamline part of our policy work and to support other 
	small organisations in such work, this year we
	developed MP Explore, a tool designed to retrieve official and publicly
	available up-to-date contact information about parliamentarians. This
	information help us to to reach representatives from several
	parliaments, when doing our policy activities.</p>

	<p><a href="https://git.fsfe.org/mp-explore/documentation/src/branch/main/community/sources.md">MP
	Explore</a> relies on well-maintained data sources that collect
	up-to-date, official, and accurate information of MPs across Europe.
	Such data sources are based on official and publicly accessible sources
	from parliaments. Currently, we have developed data sources for the
	European Parliament, the German Parliament (Bundestag), and the North
	Rhine-Westphalia State Parliament (Germany).</p>

	<p>Thanks to the contribution of our volunteers, we are currently
	coordinating the creation of MP Explore Sources for parliaments in
	Belgium, Denmark, Italy, and Norway.</p>

	<h4><br/>Ada &amp; Zangemann the movie</h4>

	<p>Since its first publication at the end of 2021, the illustrated book 
	<em>Ada &amp; Zangemann – A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry 
	Ice Cream</em> has found its way into homes, schools, and libraries 
	around the world.</p>
	<p>But in October 2024 a new milestone was reached: <em><em>Ada &amp; Zangemann</em></em> came to
	life on the big screen! On Ada Lovelace Day, <a href="/news/2024/news-20241002-01.html">the movie premiered 
	worldwide</a>. This achievement was only possible thanks
	to the support of our community. The first English screening featured
	special guests Vint Cerf, one of the
	“fathers of the Internet,” and Franziska
	Heine, Executive Director of Wikimedia Germany.</p>

	<p>The celebration continued in Germany: on 27
	November, the film premiered in Essen, in the
	country’s largest cinema, where over 800 guests, most of
	them children, enjoyed the fairy tale on the big
	screen.</p>

		<p>In 2025, the movie reached even more audiences, with new releases
	in:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><a href="/news/2025/news-20250121-01.html">French, supported by the French Ministry of Education</a></li>
	<li>Spanish, thanks to Volkswagen Spain</li>
	<li>Danish, once again made possible by our dedicated local group in Denmark and with a premier screening in
	Aarhus. </li>

	</figure>
	
	<p>You can explore all versions of the movie here: <a href="https://ada.fsfe.org/movie">ada.fsfe.org/movie</a>. The movie is 
	in our <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1e89M45YLyvEScHeDjAgzI9CgyHHi7bm">YouTube</a> 
	and <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/p/k77oZk33uLy95DZmx8FUHJ">Peertube</a> 
	channels, where some versions are already 
	more than 2100 single viewers. As it is
	distributed under a Creative Commons license, <a href="https://ada.fsfe.org/movie">anyone is able to download and
	share the movie</a>, embed it on websites, use it in schools, display it
	at events including cinemas (for which we provide special movie files), 
	and integrate it with other educational material, making a
	difference to the quality of tech education that is so vital for young
	people in our digital society.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, the book itself continues its global journey, having distributed over 15.000. Originally
	published in German and English, it is now published in 11 languages, most recently Danish,
	through the incredible efforts of our local group there, <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/agger/2025/06/24/on-publishing-ada-zangemann-in-danish/">who
	not only translated the story but also created a publishing company to
	bring it to life.</a> </p>

	</figure>

	<p>Altogether, more than 25,000 children worldwide have discovered Ada’s
	story through books, readings, screenings, discussions, and workshops.</p>

	<p>And there’s even more: thanks to our Italian volunteers, <em><em>Ada
	&amp; Zangemann</em></em> can now be enjoyed as as an
	<a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/3gkJp3EENfs1WkbXfPrvCt">audio
	book in Italian</a>. Other Italian volunteers created an Ada &amp; Zangemnann themed
	mini-game on the Luanti gaming platform .<a href="https://codeberg.org/LuantiFSFE">Try it
	out!</a></p>
	<p>Readings have also taken place in Italy, Spain, <a href="https://grundschuleoberweier.de/detail/nachricht/id/19720-vorlesetag-in-oberweier/?cb-id=22679"> 
	rural
	Germany</a>, and as far away as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7260969487418470400/">Sri
	Lanka</a>! And thanks mainly to the amazing work of our volunteers, this year the improvements to the Ada
	&amp; Zangemann git repository 
	continued. The docbook source format was merged and expanded to support 
	more output formats, including the previous source format for backwards 
	compatibility. Online translations on Weblate are now possible because 
	of this, resulting in 28 languages in some state of progress. The 
	automation is being improved with the community, with plans for better 
	documentation and more formats like the online digibook by C&amp;F Editions 
	and the Kamishibai format by Squeeek.</p>

	<h4><br/>They are young + they need the
	code</h4>

	<p>The FSFE's pilot project “They are young + they need the code” is also 
	using by the book "Ada &amp; Zangemann". This educational format,
	designed by the FSFE, helps the children to understand the importance of
	controlling their own technology, through reading the book and manual
	activities. Currently the project is being tested in Italy, and we are
	waiting to hear back from our volunteers, who are bringing the format to
	the schools and libraries.</p>

</figure>

	<p>This educational format can take place in schools or libraries, where volunteers
	read the book or play the audiobook and then guide the children in an
	activity such as a treasure hunt, robotics lab, or drawing session.
	Through this mix of storytelling and hands-on learning, children
	discover the importance of controlling their own technology"</p>


	<h4><br/>Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</h4>

	<p>One more year, one more round of Youth Hacking 4 Freedom. And another
	one on the way! In October 2024, we went to Brussels for <a href="/news/2024/news-20241027-01.html">the 3rd YH4F
	Awards Ceremony</a>. Once again, we were impressed by the quality and
	creativity of the projects submitted. This round was also the first time
	we had some team projects among the winners. </p>

	<p>Moreover, this initiative is made possible thanks to the generous
	financial support of our donor, <a href="https://download.fsfe.org/videos/yh4f/Wiesemann_video.webm">Reinhard
	Wiesemann</a>, as well as several sponsors. In 2024, <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a> joined the competition, and this
	year we are also proud to have <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a> and SUSE OSCC on board.</p>


	<h2 id="legal-education">Legal Education</h2>

	<p><a href="/news/2025/news-20250820-01.html"/></p>
	<p>In the past twelve months, the FSFE has increased our efforts to
	spread awareness and education about the legal concepts and issues that
	affect Free Software. We feel that this is a particularly important area
	to work on, as having a basic understanding of the legal principles
	behind Free Software can help developers better navigate essential
	aspects of Free Software, such as copyright and licensing.</p>


	<p>To that end, the FSFE has developed a training curriculum for basic
	legal topics. This year, we have provided our training to many
	vocational students in computer science in Italy, through the Italian
	based <a href="https://edulife.it/en/home/"><em>Edulife
	project</em></a>. </p>

	<p>Additionally, this year saw the launch of our <a href="/tags/tagged-legal-corner.html">Legal Corner, a regular
	column</a> that seeks to explain various legal concepts that Free Software
	developers may encounter, as well as explore current events in the legal
	realm that impact Free Software.Up to know we have deal with the following topics:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><a href="/news/2025/news-20250217-01.html">MIA or Dead Contributors - Does It Matter For Your Software Project?</a></li>
	<li><a href="/news/2025/news-20250407-01.html">Restrictions on our Freedom to Study Software: A Legal Case Study from Poland</a></li>
	<li><a href="/news/2025/news-20250515-01.html">The threshold of originality for copyrightable source code</a></li>
	<li><a href="/news/2025/news-20250820-01.html">Bringing SumUp to compliance: a case study of license enforcement</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>As explained in one of the Legal Corner articles, one of our 
	volunteers, and team member, discovered that SumUp’s “Solo” payment 
	terminal incorporated multiple Free Software components without 
	providing the required disclosures, license texts, copyright 
	attribution, or access to source code. She contacted SumUp and 
	demanded compliance under the applicable Free 
 Software licenses; after almost a year of back-and-forth, SumUp 
 finally delivered a USB stick containing the required disclosures and the CCS. Additionally, SumUp 
 also updated their Solo device software to now show the relevant FOSS 
 disclosures, and also to indicate where users will be able to access 
 the CCS.</p>

	</figure>
		
	
	<p>The FSFE also concluded our direct work in the EU funded <a href="https://zooom4u.eu/"><em>ZOOOM Initiative</em></a> early this
	year. This was a project that sought to raise awareness on the
	importance of Free Software, Open Hardware, and Open Data, as key
	pillars of a sustainable, trustworthy, and sovereign industrial
	ecosystem in Europe. While <a href="/news/2024/news-20241231-01.html">the project
	has come to an end</a>, we are nevertheless still involved in spreading
	awareness of the <a href="https://zooom4u.eu/index.php/toolkit/"><em>ZOOOM Toolkit</em></a>,
	a resource produced during the project for SMEs to learn how to
	integrate the open principles of software, hardware, and data into their
	business models.</p>

	<h4><br/>NGI projects</h4>
	<p>Since 2018, the FSFE has been involved in the <a href="/activities/ngi/ngi.html">Next Generation
	Internet Zero (NGI0) initiative</a> as a consortium member. Funded
	by the European Commission, the <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ngi-zero/">NGI0
	initiative</a> hopes to support the development of the internet
	into a platform, which is also referred to as the Next Generation
	Internet, that is accessible and diverse, and that respects fundamental
	rights, including values such as privacy. At the FSFE, we believe that
	Free Software is key to accomplish this goal, so that all users are able
	to use the internet as an effective tool to achieve their full
	potential.</p>

	<p>NGI0 projects provide financial grants and technical support to
	researchers and developers who are working on Free Software solutions
	that contribute to the establishment of the vision of the Next
	Generation Internet.</p>

	<p>We have for the past year been working on our current NGI0 projects:
	<a href="https://nlnet.nl/entrust"><em>NGI0 Entrust</em></a>, <a href="https://nlnet.nl/core"><em>NGI0 Core</em></a>, <a href="https://nlnet.nl/commonsfund/"><em>NGI0 Commons Fund</em></a>, and
	<a href="https://nlnet.nl/NGI0/review/"><em>NGI0 Review</em></a>.</p>

	<p>As we’ve always done with our previous NGI0 projects, we have been
	assisting the software projects receiving grants from these various NGI0
	projects with their legal and licensing needs, as well as helping them
	in their transitions when adopting our <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE specification</a>.</p>
	
	
	<figure>
		</figure>

	<p>We continued our work with NGI0 this year by helping many developers
	working on Free Software solutions solve a diverse range of problems, as
	well as helping them have a better understanding of Free Software
	licenses, compliance issues, and how they can avoid some of these
	pitfalls by adopting our REUSE specification.</p>

	<p>As part of our work in NGI0, we have also attended several
	conferences, giving talks about it and Free Software.</p>


	<h4><br/>LLW and Legal Network</h4>

	<p>The <a href="/activities/ln/llw.html">FSFE’s Free
	Software Legal &amp; Licensing Workshop (LLW)</a>, is a a two and a half
	day conference for members of the <a href="/activities/ln/ln.html">Legal
	Network community</a> to meet face-to-face and share legal expertise. In
	2025, the conference was held in the Unperfekthaus in Essen, bringing
	together over 100 legal and compliance professionals, technologists, and
	policy experts from across the globe. The 2025 edition delved into the
	evolving legal landscapes impacting Free Software, with a particular
	focus on Artificial Intelligence and cybersecurity. </p>

	<h2 id="volunteer-engagement">Volunteer Engagement</h2>

	<p>Since September 2024, we have published around 60 news items in
	English, our official outreach language, with some of
	these also translated into other European languages thanks to our <a href="/contribute/translators/">awesome team of
	translators</a>. Kudos to all of them!</p>

	<p>To make their work even easier, this year we <a href="/news/2025/news-20250429-01.html">simplified
	the FSFE translation process by integrating LibreTranslate</a> into our
	translator tool, Webpreview. We also updated our
	<a href="/contribute/translators/">translators
	page.</a> to make the process clearer and more
	accessible.</p>

	<p>We made some small but meaningful updates to our
	website as well. For example the
	donors page to improve transparency and recognition for our supporters. 
	The donors page now shows donation amounts more clearly and includes a 
	visual marker
	indicating how long each donor has been supporting the FSFE. You can
	check out the updated page <a href="/donate/thankgnus-2025.html">here</a>. Our
	supporters quotes at the main page are also changed regularly and we are
	finishing moving all our pages in the wiki into docs.fsfe.org.</p>

	<p>But that’s not all. We released 12 new episodes of our Software Freedom Podcast,
	including a brand-new series explaining European policy topics related
	to Free Software. We continued featuring inspiring guests, such as <a href="/news/podcast/episode-30.html">Marc
	Prud’hommeaux discussing his App Fair Project</a>, and explored
	initiatives like <a href="/news/podcast/episode-29.html">South Tyrol’s
	steps toward software freedom</a>. Thanks to our volunteers, who not
	only help with editing but also contribute technically, our podcasts are
	gradually adopting Podcast 2.0v features! And we continued with our monthly newsletter and our mailings!
	</p>

	<p>Our presence in the Fediverse is growing, so in followers in <a href="https://mastodon.social/deck/@fsfe">Mastodon</a> and in our <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/">Peertube channel</a>. In the later you 
	can also find out all our videos, from our well known "What is Free 
	Software" video to our presence in the latest conferences.</p>

	<p>In 2024, the FSFE were also part of the organization of the 1st Berlin 
	Fediverse Day. You can <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/p/s1FdPaxD2aHH94cWDhcmo9">find out all 
	the talks from that event on our Peertube Channel</a>. Currently, we are 
	involved in the organization of the 2nd Berlin Fediverse Day, which will 
	take place at the beginning of October.</p>

	<p>In 2025, the FSFE announce it suport to the <a href="/news/2025/news-20250120-01.html">the Dutch call to adopt social 
	media platforms that respect public values</a>.</p>

	<p>One last news related to the Fediverse: since the beginning of the year 
	we are using the Fediverse as discussion room for our publications, 
	pointing the discussion link of the articles to the Fediverse posting 
	about that publication. This result on the turning off the Discourse 
	forums at community.fsfe.org by the end of March 2025.</p>


	<h4><br/>IloveFS</h4>

	<p>Each year on the 14 February we celebrate the <a href="/activities/ilovefs/">“I Love Free Software
	Day”</a>. On this day, we thank all the people behind Free Software
	projects or programs and let them know that their work does not go
	unnoticed. </p>

	<p>One more year we asked our community to join us organizing different
	local events to celebrate this occasion. A lot of you followed our call
	for action! In 2025 the FSFE and its local groups focused on hidden Free
	Software projects for the "I Love Free Software Day". Together we wanted
	to raise awareness of all the hidden Free Software Projects that power
	our daily infrastructure. Free Software is everywhere and often it is
	the small projects that become a vital part of our lives - therefore we
	dedicated this "I Love Free Software Day" to all those projects that are
	not that prominent, so to shed some light on them. ❤️</p>

	<p>We had 19 amazing events in 11 different European countries. Each
	event was unique and every group came up with a different idea on how to
	mark this special occasion. </p>

	<p>It was and is inspiring to see how many of you participated in the “I
	Love Free Software Day”. Without you this would not have been possible.
	Find out more about the “I Love Free Software Day 2025” and the
	different events and thanks you! in our <a href="/activities/ilovefs/report/report_2025.html">ilovefs
	2025 report</a>.</p>


	<h4><br/>Our community and conferences</h4>  
	<p> As always, raising public awareness remains a key part of our mission, with active participation 
	in SFSCON, 38c3, FOSDEM... This important presence would not have been possible without 
	the dedication of our outstanding volunteers, who not only supported us 
	at these major gatherings but also took the initiative to organize 
	booths at various local events. Their commitment and hard work play a 
	vital role in bringing our message to a wider audience.</p>

<p> Our local groups have also been active with different initiatives 
beyond their regular meetings. For example, the Berlin and Zurich 
groups contributed to the End of 10 initiative, organizing local events 
to help users transition to Linux; the Polish group joined the FSF’s 
40th anniversary celebrations in Warsaw; and the Netherlands group has 
been working on translating Ada &amp; Zangemann into Dutch; a 
story that, as mentioned earlier, is now also available in Danish 
thanks to our community there.</p>

The setting is       casual, with some people wearing T-shirts and shorts"/>

<p> Alongside these local efforts, we also came together twice as a 
wider community to spend time with our community and supporters. In November, 
we enjoyed a beautiful hike near Bolzano, followed by lively 
conversations over lunch. During the summer, we gathered in Berlin for 
our Summer Meeting at the Software Freedom Flat to share inspiring 
talks, delicious food, and even home-made ice cream! All while working on
Free Software topics for the upcoming monhts. </p>

<p> In recent years, the FSFE has partnered with LUGBZ (Linux User 
Group Bolzano-Bozen) to honor individuals who have made exceptional 
contributions to the promotion and dissemination of Free Software 
across Europe. The 2024 European SFS Award, presented at last year’s 
SFSCON, was awarded posthumously to <a href="/news/2024/news-20241108-01.html">Vim developer Bram 
	Moolenaar</a>. </p>

	<h4>Merchandising and Info Material</h4>
	<p>At the end of 2024, we reintroduced hoodies to our merchandise
	catalogue! Available in blue or black, these zipped hoodies were
	primarily offered through pre-order and could be picked up at various
	conferences. Since they are too bulky for regular online shipping, we
	reserved them for in-person distribution. Featuring a redesigned
	illustration of the Free Software Four Freedoms on the back, we also
	ordered a few extra, so you can still find them at our booth at several
	upcoming events.</p>

The     black hoodie has white text that reads use, study,     share, and improve, each accompanied by a relevant     icon, while the blue hoodie displays the same text and     icons in white. They are in an indoor setting with a FSFE banner in the background,     decorated with colorful string lights"/>

	<p>In 2025, we expanded our merchandise with two new temporary tattoo
	sheets:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/d7/b6/a562307f23bcc7a7617599a757d1.jpg">one 
	inspired by the illustrated book Ada &amp; Zangemann – A Tale of 
	Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream</a>,</li>
	<li>
	<a href="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/2f/fd/0acf29e820ed4afe41073666d1ce.jpg">and 
	another featuring logos from our different activities</a>.
	</li>
	</ul>

</figure>
	
	<p>Our information materials  have also grown: from the Device Neutrality
	campaign, we now have a poster and a round sticker, as well as a new
	poster presenting our Vision for 2048.</p>
	
	<p>This summer, we’ve made some updates to our <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html">“Spread
	the Word” page</a> to make it easier for you to order
	exactly the materials you need. You can now choose from four different
	package sizes: "My laptop", "I want postcards", "Stickers for me and my friend", and 
	Standard.There is
	an extra option, Custom, for you to
	detailed your needs so you only get what you
	need/want.</p>

	<p>But the news are not over! We’re starting some collaborations to create
	some new designs that we hope you will enjoy while we continue to
	improve our website to make your orders, merchandising or promo
	material, easier! One of them is <a href="https://www.hellotux.com/fsfe">https://www.hellotux.com/fsfe</a>: you can order now at this
	online shop some cool clothes with our logo! &gt;</p>

	<h2 id="core-infra">Core Infrastructure</h2>

	<p>During this last year our System Hackers &amp; Administrators have
	been hard at work ensuring that the technical infrastructure that
	supports the FSFE’s work remains healthy and aligned with our needs and
	those of our community. Aside from the never ending maintenance work in
	our servers and services, this year has seen the release and development
	of widespread improvements that have optimized our work. It has also
	seen our infrastructure struggling under the pressure that malicious
	LLM bots induce.</p>
	
	<figure>
	<img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/b5/ac/ad92493fcfece12353eefe646b83.jpg" alt="Router"/>	
	</figure>

	<p>Our custom website build process, which takes care of rendering the
	more than 5500 pages of our website, has seen major improvements thanks
	to one of our System Hackers who took on the challenge of
	revamping it with a focus on speed and maintainability. Thanks to the
	improvements brought by this change, we have been considering the
	introduction of many features, such as native Markdown support, that
	will further streamline our work.</p>

	<p>The improvement of the website build process goes hand in hand with
	the changes made to <a href="https://webpreview.fsfe.org/">Webpreview</a>, our one-stop tool 
	for publishers,
	translators, and proofreaders, which has been used as the testing ground
	for upcoming features like Markdown support.</p>

	<p>Besides, the FSFE infrastructure is targeted by LLM harvesting bots,
	like many other communities alike. The services suffered the most were
	the mailing list archives and the git server. The mailing lists
	operation was disrupted due to a problem that happened in the database of
	the list archive server and access to many files and functionality on
	the git service had to be closed for supporters only. While the mailing
	list archives remain closed at the moment to prevent them from the LLM
	bots, access to the git service could be lifted again after deploying
	Anubis as additional layer and tighten up the existing firewall
	rules.</p><p>In the last few months, we have been organizing monthly calls with
	our System Hackers to ensure that, even though we are spread all over
	Europe, we can coordinate and easily discuss improvements and next steps
	to our infrastructure.</p>

	<h2 id="movement">Join the
	movement</h2>

	<p><strong>Become a supporter:</strong> Your support and 
	contribution for the promotion of Free Software are important for 
	securing our continuous work, ensuring our independence, 
	strengthening our democratic society, promoting and implementing 
	concrete steps towards software freedom, and making it easier to 
	use and develop Free Software.</p> <p>Advocating for freedom costs 
	money and we depend on people like you to <a href="/donate/donate.html">support us</a>.Thanks also to all our 
	supporters and <a href="/donate/thankgnus-2025.html">our donors 
	</a>for their generous financial contributions. In the last twelve 
	months, we want to especially thank our donors who contributed 
	18,000 € or more per year: <strong>Vodafone</strong>, <strong>Internet Archive Europe</strong>, 
	<strong>Proton Pass</strong>, and <strong>Linuxhotel</strong>. We also warmly thank those who 
	donated 3,600 € or more per year, such as <strong>AVM</strong>, <strong>FastBill</strong>, <strong>GitHub</strong>, 
	<strong>Heinlein</strong>, <strong>Intevation</strong>, <strong>OpenProject</strong>, <strong>Reinhard Wiesemann</strong>, <strong>Siemens</strong>, and 
	<strong>Y Combinator</strong>.</p> 
	
	<p>At the same time, we want to express our 
	heartfelt gratitude to everyone making smaller contributions. Even 
	if the amount looks modest, we know it can be a real effort, and 
	together these donations make a big difference in sustaining our 
	work.</p>
<p>We guarantee that all support is used to foster software freedom in Europe a little more each day, step by step, bit by bit, for the next decades.</p>
<p>With your help we can keep on defending software freedom. Thank you
	for your trust, your support, and your ideas to continue bringing Free
	Software to our society!</p>
