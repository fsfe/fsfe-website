          As a Free Software developer and enthusiast, I'm most grateful to the
          wonderful people at the FSFE for doing all the hard work of
          campaigning, marketing and representing our shared interests in
          Brussels and elsewhere. Writing good software is one thing, but
          getting the word out, countering corporate lobbying, and working
          towards an environment where Free Software even gets a chance in
          public sector tenders is equally important. Being a supporter is an
          excellent way to support the FSFE towards those goals.
