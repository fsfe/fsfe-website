      <h1>Fellowship of FSFE</h1>
    </center>

    <p>
      The Fellowship is a community for digital freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is the place where the Fellows of the Free Software Foundation Europe
      meet and come together to share ideas, collaborate on projects and inform
      each other about what is going on in the world of Free Software. The
      Fellowship is a community of people who take interest in the multiple
      interactions of Free Software with economy, politics, science and society
      and seek to change things for the better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Joining the Fellowship is the easiest and most direct way to get involved
      with, remain informed about and support the work of the Free Software
      Foundation Europe. Besides a &quot;login@fsfe.org&quot; mail address, a
      homepage and a blog, each Fellow receives  a Cryptocard developed by
      Werner Koch, the author of GnuPG. This permits data and email encryption
      at a security level hitherto almost inaccessible to the private user.
