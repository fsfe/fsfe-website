        <title>DevConf.CZ -  Engaging with the next generation: A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream in Brno, Czech Republic</title>

    <body>
      <p>Together, with the book author Matthias Kirschner, we will read  "Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream" . This illustrated book tells the story of the famous inventor Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada begins to experiment with hardware and software, and in the process realises how crucial it is for her and others to control technology.</p>
      <p>Matthias Kirschner will briefly share experiences from readings, and we will discuss concepts how to engage with younger audiences about Free Software. The goal is to enable each participant to better connect with young audiences about technology and together further develop a reusable tool kit for such readings.</p>
      <p>DevConf.CZ is taking place in Brno from 13 to 15 June. <br/>
