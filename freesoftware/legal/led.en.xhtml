<h3>Learn about Free Software in the Legal Context with the FSFE's first Legal 
Education Day</h3>
<h3>Date: Saturday, 6 November 2021</h3>
<h3>Venue: FSFEâ€™s online meeting instance</h3>


    <p> 

    Free Software grants users and developers the essential freedoms to construct a
    healthy and open digital ecosystem. To preserve and guarantee the continued 
    enjoyment of those freedoms, it is important to understand and comply with the 
    legal framework which safeguards our software projects from potential legal
    threats and also makes sure they reach their full potential.
    
    </p>


    <p> 
    Understanding the legal matters and complying with legal obligations can become 
    a burden sometimes. That is the reason why we are happy to be organizing the
    first Legal Education Day (LED). It aims to spread basic legal education on 
    the legal context of Free Software, so that licensing your project, 
    understanding copyright, and meeting legal obligations in your software project 
    will be less of a headache. </p>

    <p> We will explain basic legal concepts such as license, copyright law, and 
    its practical application into your projects with our 
    <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> initiative. Trademarks, Patents, and Containers
    are more advanced parts of our agenda. </p>
   
     <p> 
     The agenda and more information about our event will be shared on this page, stay tuned!
   </p>

    <p> This webinar is open for all to attend free of charge. You can register your 
    participation here</p>
