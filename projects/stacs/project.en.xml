    <description>
     STACS (Science, technology and civil society) is a project that seeks to
     bridge the gap between civil society and research in order to increase
     the societal relevance of research being done. The project aims to do this
     by educating both civil society organisations and researchers, and finding
     common projects to work on for the future.
