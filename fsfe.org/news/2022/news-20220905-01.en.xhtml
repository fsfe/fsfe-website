<p>
  A broad alliance of 13 organisations from the fields of environmental 
  protection, digital policy, development cooperation and academia 
  publishes a catalog of demands to show political solutions towards a 
  more sustainable digital society. This as a prelude to the upcoming 
  conference for digitization and sustainability &quot;Bits &amp; 
  Bäume&quot;.

<p>
  A broad alliance of 13 organizations from the fields of environmental 
  protection and nature conservation, digital policy, development 
  cooperation and academia demands: Digitization must be at the service 
  of society and social and ecological change. This is what the 
  organizations are calling for at the forthcoming conference on 
  digitization and sustainability <a href="https://bits-und-baeume.org/">&quot;Bits &amp; Bäume&quot;</a>, 
  which will take place from September 30 to October 2, 2022 in Berlin. 
  Today, the same organizations publish a catalog of demands that show 
  political solutions towards a more sustainable digital society.

      Global access to technology and in service of society is a 
      pre-condition for a sustainable future. Free Software is crucial 
      for that.

<p>
  Digital technologies are double-edged. It is becoming increasingly 
  clear how digital technologies are contributing to the increasing 
  demand for resources worldwide and how facilitate monopolization 
  tendencies across sectors. On the other hand, with use of Free 
  Software, they can also help contributing to equal access and 
  participation in technologies and help improving living conditions 
  and environmental protection worldwide.
</p>

<p>
  The organizations demand that politics align the strategic framework 
  for digitization with the needs for nature, climate and resource 
  protection and the preservation of biodiversity. Along with this, 
  digitization must support a globally fair and sustainable economic 
  system that enables everyone to participate while actively involving 
  local communities and civil society groups in shaping the global 
  digital economy and politics. 
</p>

<p>
  The big questions of digitization are discussed, including social 
  participation, socio-ecological transformation, food sovereignty, 
  economic order, common goods and a global peace order. Free Software 
  comes as a basic technology for the demands made by the alliance 
  because it is decisive for the longevity and reusability of hardware, 
  gives users control over their technology and because it guarantees 
  legally secure international cooperation and reuse while at the same 
  time allowing local adaptation.
</p>

<p>
  The demands form the prelude to the forthcoming conference for 
  digitization and sustainability <a href="https://bits-und-baeume.org/">“Bits &amp; Bäume”</a>, which 
  will take place from September 30 to October 2, 2022 in Berlin. The 
  FSFE is part of the organisational committee, thus co-organiser. <a href="https://bits-und-baeume.org/en/conference-2022/program/">The 
  program</a> that has just been published offers exciting topics 
  related to Free Software and the commons, and <a href="https://bits-und-baeume.org/en/conference-2022/tickets/">ticket 
  sales</a> have started.

  <li>
    As shown in our recent <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">Study on 
    the sustainability of Free Software</a>, the access and use of Free 
    Software is crucial to the longevity of hardware. The longer we use 
    this hardware, the fewer resources we need to produce new hardware.

      Our <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/">Upcycling Android 
      Initiative</a> helps users to take back control of their phones 
      and use their phones longer.
    </p>

    <p>
      International development cooperation is also increasingly 
      benefiting from the sustainability of Free Software. As shown in 
      our <a href="/freesoftware/developmentcooperation/developmentcooperation.html">article</a>, 
      Free Software is an indispensable basic technology that ensures 
      legally secure international cooperation and reuse and enables 
      global scaling with simultaneous local customization options.
