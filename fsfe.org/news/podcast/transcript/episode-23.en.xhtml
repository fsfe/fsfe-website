00:00.000 --> 00:19.440
Hello and welcome to Software Freedom Podcast. This podcast is brought to you by the free

00:19.440 --> 00:25.600
Software Foundation Europe and we are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:25.600 --> 00:31.280
For today's podcast, I have a bit of a special surprise for you. I have a whole bunch of very

00:31.280 --> 00:37.920
nice people here with me. I have Tobias, our system administrator. Yes, so one of the system

00:37.920 --> 00:43.760
administrators. That's right. I have Matthias Kirschner, our president of the Free Software

00:43.760 --> 00:51.440
Foundation Europe. Hi Matthias. Hello. And I have Gabriel Kuwebin, our part of the legal

00:51.440 --> 00:59.440
team. To be anonymous. I never said I prefer to be anonymous. I said I prefer to be an enigma.

00:59.440 --> 01:05.360
Oh, yeah, right. I'm sorry. I can't believe it. Hi. And thank you so much for joining me for

01:05.360 --> 01:12.720
today's podcast. So I have prepared something very special. Okay. I want to bring free software

01:12.720 --> 01:20.640
terms out there and to explain them a bit more to other people and yeah, to just spread the

01:20.640 --> 01:25.520
word about free software and also to make it easier for others to learn about free software.

01:26.560 --> 01:32.000
So to give them the basic introduction to free software, I have a back here. I love

01:32.000 --> 01:38.640
the Christmas back with a lot of free software terms in it. Some are more related to free software

01:38.640 --> 01:47.440
than others, but they all have something to do with free software and computers and all that

01:47.440 --> 01:55.040
stuff around us. So you all have to take one of them. You have to describe it to the others

01:55.040 --> 02:02.960
and the others then have to guess what it says. All right. Okay. So we make it a bit more fun to

02:02.960 --> 02:10.400
explain free software and yeah, that we also have some fun ourselves. I will just start if

02:10.400 --> 02:16.960
that's okay for you. So yeah. I'm nervous because I'm not sure which one I will pick. I can't

02:16.960 --> 02:22.240
I wrote some of them, but not all of them. So you need to wrestle a little bit more so that

02:22.240 --> 02:27.600
the viewers can hear that you're picking something a lot of them in there. And what of our listeners

02:27.600 --> 02:35.040
also don't don't see is that the small bag is very much matching with Bonnie's jumper.

02:35.760 --> 02:43.440
So it's very Christmas. I love Christmas. I can't tell you how much I love Christmas,

02:44.000 --> 02:50.560
but now to my free software term that I have, it's a set of tools that we all daily use

02:50.560 --> 02:57.520
on our daily life that we use on our computers. There are a whole bunch of different software

02:57.520 --> 03:06.160
projects under this term. Operating systems? No, and it's more about like we also have to mask

03:06.160 --> 03:20.080
card. So the news software projects. Yes. Okay. Well, then I think it started in the 80s, right?

03:21.040 --> 03:28.720
Yes. 1983. We celebrated 40 years of Knu this year. Oh my gosh. What does Knu stand for?

03:29.280 --> 03:38.240
That stands for Knu is not Unix. It's a recursive acronym and that's something that hackers like.

03:39.600 --> 03:47.440
So and a lot of people don't get that, but a lot of other people they find it very fun. And then

03:47.680 --> 03:54.560
they like to combine those acronyms, right? So GIMP is then the Knu image manipulation program.

03:55.200 --> 03:59.920
And so you get a whole family tree of acronyms out of it.

04:00.960 --> 04:06.720
This I knew gets often one of the biggest problems how to name your project and the rest of

04:06.720 --> 04:11.200
then is then just implementation, but this part is a really hard part of a project.

04:12.160 --> 04:26.240
All right. To be as it's your turn. All right. So to get all those nice tools running on the one hand,

04:26.240 --> 04:37.440
we have the free source code. Yes, we leave a compiler to translate it the source code into the

04:37.440 --> 04:45.520
binary file that is then run on our beloved computers. Yeah. Well, you need to wrestle it louder.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.600
Okay. Let me see.

04:56.080 --> 05:04.560
Okay. So if someone wrote a nice piece of free software and other people

05:04.720 --> 05:11.120
are proposing changes to this, they usually put a request.

05:13.200 --> 05:21.440
That's it. That's it. So they open a pull request and say, hi, here's a patch and you can apply this

05:21.440 --> 05:26.400
and then it's getting reviewed and reviewed again and then it's closed or merged.

05:27.120 --> 05:33.360
So and how do we check that you didn't know which ones are in there?

05:34.080 --> 05:40.080
Yeah, because Bonnie wrote all the over party terms in there. Do you honestly believe that I

05:40.080 --> 05:45.440
could give them in my head? Well, I also noticed that you know, each of the cards are like

05:45.440 --> 05:51.040
different size and different shapes. This is how you identify them from the back. Yeah, sure.

05:51.600 --> 06:03.040
Okay. Okay. I'm picking one. Okay. Oh, this one has a do not say a word on the card.

06:03.760 --> 06:07.840
Then you're not so. Yeah. Oh, this is this is tricky.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.080
Those are the advanced ones for the senior staff.

06:12.560 --> 06:25.760
When you have, when you want to give people permission to use your source code that you have

06:25.760 --> 06:36.240
copyright over, you use exactly. And when two of these conflict with each other or they do not

06:36.240 --> 06:42.800
conflict with each other, this is a concept called license incompatibility. Well, it's license

06:42.800 --> 06:49.920
compatibility here, but I'm going to say that that is also correct. Yeah. Not the way how I'll pronounce

06:49.920 --> 06:58.000
this, but yes. For the license compatibility. Is there a license that's really easy to use?

06:58.000 --> 07:02.480
It's like that's really compatible with a lot of projects or is there also license that's not

07:02.480 --> 07:10.160
compatible at all. If you stop for license. Yeah. I mean, this is a tricky question because there's

07:10.160 --> 07:16.800
like inbound and outbound compatibility. But I mean, it's if you take something like a very

07:16.800 --> 07:22.800
permissive license like the MIT license, then you know, anybody can do whatever they want with it.

07:22.800 --> 07:30.000
And generally, if something is licensed and the MIT license, then you know, because it's so

07:30.080 --> 07:36.080
permissive. I think there's there's a little bit of a problem with your question, though,

07:36.080 --> 07:42.960
because like I wouldn't come wouldn't say like one license is totally the most compatible license

07:42.960 --> 07:49.680
because there's no such thing. You know, you should think of compatibility as the ability to abide

07:49.680 --> 07:58.640
by all the requirements in a license while still using another license. If that makes sense.

07:58.640 --> 08:05.200
Yeah. Yeah. How compatible a license is depends on which two licenses you're talking about,

08:05.200 --> 08:09.680
rather than just saying like one license is super compatible with everything. So you need to you

08:09.680 --> 08:13.520
need to think about which two licenses you're talking about. So it's a case. It's a case by case

08:13.520 --> 08:20.160
basis. As a lawyer, it's always it depends. It can become a little bit more tricky when

08:21.120 --> 08:27.600
it's about copy left licenses. So if you have two licenses that both say, well, if you want to make

08:27.600 --> 08:34.800
modifications to this, it has to you have to again, then put it under this license. And that's

08:34.800 --> 08:40.480
what both licenses say. That's of course trickier than if one of those licenses says, well,

08:40.480 --> 08:45.680
you don't have to put it under the same license again. Well, speaking of that, I mean, since it's

08:45.680 --> 08:51.200
Christmas, you know, and we are inviting a lot of people over for dinner. I really like this

08:51.200 --> 08:56.960
example by Heather Mika, where she talks about license compatibility as kind of like hosting a

08:56.960 --> 09:03.200
dinner party for a lot of like guests with different types of like dietary requirements.

09:03.760 --> 09:10.320
So like if if someone is a vegan and refuses to eat anything or refuses to participate at the

09:10.320 --> 09:15.040
dinner, where if there is meat at the table, and then there is someone who says, like, I refuse

09:15.040 --> 09:22.640
to eat if there's a vegan at the table, then you can invite these two people to the same party,

09:22.640 --> 09:30.560
exactly. So if there you have a license that says like, I am, yeah, I think you can invite them

09:30.560 --> 09:35.680
both to the party, but they cannot eat at the table. Sure, sure. Yeah, you cannot invite them if

09:35.680 --> 09:41.040
you want there to be peace. But yeah, exactly right. They cannot eat at the table together.

09:41.040 --> 09:48.160
All right. Jeff, a prominent example where license compatibility fossil huge problem.

09:48.160 --> 09:55.920
I swear Gabriel doesn't my last question about this and I'm sorry to throw them all at you.

09:56.640 --> 10:03.040
No, I need to think about this. I mean, I think the the the the very standard one is just like

10:03.040 --> 10:07.040
Matthias said, a copy of life license with a permissive license because a copy of life license

10:07.040 --> 10:14.240
requires you to license any derivative or redistribute a copies under the same license terms,

10:14.240 --> 10:18.000
whereas the permissive license is that, you know, yeah, you can do whatever you want with the

10:18.000 --> 10:24.400
derivatives. So, you know, there is a bit of a conflict there. There have been some examples of

10:25.840 --> 10:33.840
with the UPL that they included one part in there that it's easier to also use this code than

10:33.840 --> 10:42.480
under GPL because else you cannot bring code from UPL and GPL together under certain circumstances.

10:42.480 --> 10:50.160
So they introduced a compatibility clause in there that you can go from UPL to GPL.

10:51.040 --> 10:57.040
Don't remember the exact versions, but I mean, I think for the podcast that's you can then go to

10:57.760 --> 11:03.840
to this other license and publish it under the other license so that there is the way of

11:04.800 --> 11:13.520
mixing code or mixing code in the end of project. All right. I'm going to move on now from

11:13.520 --> 11:21.280
license compatible compatibility. I don't know what he has started it now. It's stuck.

11:22.080 --> 11:29.440
He said this should be funny. And I will take one. I'm not supposed to look.

11:30.800 --> 11:38.720
Okay. There's new plus linux out there, but there are also other free operating systems.

11:39.600 --> 11:53.120
Yes, one of them. One of them. Yeah. Yes, free. Yes, free. Yes, it is.

11:56.480 --> 12:00.880
Thought you just used that to promote nicks or as a little bit more. No, next slide is a

12:00.960 --> 12:09.360
line of space. It is. And one of our consortium partners in NGI. Really?

12:10.800 --> 12:15.200
I didn't know that. Do you know that I just like to ask her quite a time. Oh, okay.

12:16.480 --> 12:22.800
Cool. Thank you. And we won't mention why the podcast.

12:22.800 --> 12:32.560
No, no, no, it has nothing to anyway. Now it's to be as a stern.

12:37.680 --> 12:43.840
He was looking at me like, that's what really mean. Yeah, I'm just thinking about the term.

12:44.800 --> 12:52.880
And if I get that correct, which I think I don't get correct, but so beside of free BSD and

12:52.880 --> 13:02.000
other BSD, there is a huge umbrella of other operations, operations systems as well. And

13:05.040 --> 13:12.320
this one is kind of special, I think. Oh, do you have to templow as card?

13:12.640 --> 13:18.320
Yes. So so now you can just try why that one is special because I was.

13:20.000 --> 13:29.040
I think I looked at it once and it was kind of interesting, but I never got into into actually

13:29.040 --> 13:36.080
installing and trying it out. I have never used the reader. I'm not planning to do it.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.960
Temple OS. At least you got it.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.560
Okay, well, then I.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.400
According to Gabriel, we have to do the sound.

13:52.320 --> 13:58.400
Oh, that's an easy one for me. I published the book

13:59.360 --> 14:06.240
and the door's conditions. Creative comments. Yeah. You're right.

14:07.360 --> 14:14.640
And what is creative comments? Creative comments is a set of licenses for

14:15.840 --> 14:21.360
mainly non-software pieces. I mean, it's also sometimes used for for software, but creative

14:21.360 --> 14:25.200
comments says about most of their licenses. You shouldn't use it for a software.

14:25.360 --> 14:32.800
And so there are some components there. What you what you can add to your license. The

14:32.800 --> 14:40.400
general one is that it says you can distribute it to others and share it with others. You can then

14:42.000 --> 14:49.200
can then add or the the clause is added that the name of the author or creator of the work should

14:49.440 --> 14:57.200
be named. So that's the by edition creative comments by then there is one about a copy left effect

14:57.200 --> 15:03.040
so that if you make modifications to the work or if you do if you further distribute it, it has

15:03.040 --> 15:09.280
to be under the same license. That's the share like option. Then there are two other options,

15:09.280 --> 15:16.080
which one of them is non-derivative so that you are not allowed to make any modifications to the

15:17.040 --> 15:24.400
work. And the other is non-commercial so that you can do all of that by just if it's

15:24.400 --> 15:30.560
non-commercial or so there were there were long debates about what is commercial and non-commercial

15:30.560 --> 15:36.800
in this. And so a lot of organization rather encouraged not to use a non-commercial

15:37.920 --> 15:41.440
FSFE being one of them. Yeah, it's interesting because you know,

15:42.240 --> 15:49.520
creative comments the the goal of the licenses is to explicitly to cover the areas that are

15:50.720 --> 15:57.680
where people want to share stuff. And in the in the area between everything being copyrighted

15:57.680 --> 16:02.400
and everything being in the public domain. So there's a there's a there's a range in between

16:02.400 --> 16:09.120
there that the creative comments licenses want to cover. But with the non-commercial licenses,

16:09.120 --> 16:14.800
I mean it's the same it's the situation unlike free software licenses because if you have a

16:14.800 --> 16:19.440
non-commercial clause in a free software license or in a license then that makes it non-free.

16:19.440 --> 16:25.200
So it's interesting to me I guess because the creative comments licenses are not meant for

16:25.200 --> 16:31.760
software or not intended for software that you know, they have these exceptions that are

16:32.320 --> 16:37.440
that don't straddle or that don't overlap with what the free software licenses are trying to

16:37.440 --> 16:44.080
accomplish. Yeah. So and the non-commercial license there's also sometimes used by

16:44.960 --> 16:50.800
people who say, well, yeah, it is free software. And then if you look deeper, then you might find

16:50.800 --> 16:58.400
some pieces in there that are under CC by non-commercial. And yeah, then it's a proprietary software

16:58.400 --> 17:05.280
with this part in there. So that's one piece there. The other thing about creative comments that's also

17:05.680 --> 17:14.880
worth noting is that it was founded by Lawrence Lessig. And Lawrence Lessig was beside that

17:14.880 --> 17:21.520
also the author of from my perspective, a very important book. It's called Code and other

17:21.520 --> 17:28.080
laws of cyberspace. And I mean at least for me that was one of the most influential books I read

17:28.560 --> 17:36.240
where it's explained how people are regulated and how people are influenced by markets, by social

17:36.240 --> 17:44.400
norms, by laws, and by architecture where code is one part of that. And I think that's if you

17:44.400 --> 17:49.520
haven't read it yet, I would highly recommend to read this book. I will link it in the show notes.

17:50.160 --> 17:56.240
Thank you. All right, your turn.

17:58.800 --> 18:06.560
Ah, okay. Well, I mean, we've already talked about this a little bit. I would just say MIT.

18:07.680 --> 18:14.080
Permissive license. It's very good. The answer on this card is permissive license. And the MIT

18:14.080 --> 18:20.480
is, it's a lot of people understand it to be a permissive license by FSFE. We understand the term,

18:20.480 --> 18:26.720
or we prefer to use the term non-reciprocal license because I mean, we prefer the terms reciprocal

18:26.720 --> 18:35.520
license as well to describe copy-left licenses because it's more descriptive and of what they

18:35.520 --> 18:40.560
accomplish. You have to reciprocate with the license terms when you create a derivative or when you

18:40.560 --> 18:46.080
distribute a copy. And for permissive license, I mean, the descriptive term is non-reciprocal license

18:46.080 --> 18:50.560
because you don't have to reciprocate the terms on any derivatives or distribute a copies.

18:51.520 --> 18:56.240
Does that make sense? No. Can I explain it again?

18:56.240 --> 19:01.040
So I mean, when you reciprocate, like, when someone does something, you do something back for them,

19:01.040 --> 19:07.840
right? So if someone shares with you a piece of code under certain terms and then you reciprocate

19:07.840 --> 19:13.280
by sharing it with others under the same terms. So that's a reciprocal kind of relationship.

19:13.280 --> 19:18.800
And when the license requires you to reciprocate, then we call their reciprocal license. And generally,

19:18.800 --> 19:23.600
there's also, there's a copy-left license, you know, you get it and then you reciprocate the

19:23.600 --> 19:29.120
license terms to any derivatives or distributed copies. And when you have a non-reciprocal license,

19:29.120 --> 19:37.760
like the MIT license, the copyright holder grants you the rights to use the source code or the

19:37.760 --> 19:43.360
program under certain terms, but you don't have to reciprocate the terms. So under non-reciprocal

19:43.440 --> 19:49.440
license or a permissive license, this is written on the card. Yeah, you can do whatever you want.

19:49.440 --> 19:53.040
Yeah, you can do whatever you want. You can make a derivative.

19:55.520 --> 20:01.840
I think it's a little bit careful about that you can do whatever you want. I just recently had

20:01.840 --> 20:09.280
a call with a company and they were very upset because they found out what obligations they have

20:09.440 --> 20:15.920
with some of those licenses and they got some emails from people about what they haven't done

20:15.920 --> 20:21.680
on their website with naming all the projects there and paying attribution there. So, sure,

20:21.680 --> 20:26.320
maybe I'm being a bad lawyer when I say do whatever you want because whenever I say do whatever

20:26.320 --> 20:32.000
you want, I'm thinking of in terms of licensing terms. I do whatever you want in terms of

20:32.000 --> 20:38.640
re-licensing derivatives and stuff like that. So one drawback about non-reciprocal slash permissive

20:38.640 --> 20:44.480
licenses is that they can turn up derivatives of them can end up being proprietary software.

20:44.480 --> 20:49.600
So, yeah, we're talking about license terms. I mean, the license itself requires you to have

20:50.240 --> 20:53.920
different fields and obligations. All right, I haven't paused it on yet.

20:58.320 --> 21:10.160
Okay, we already covered it before that why we wouldn't recommend that in some of those

21:10.400 --> 21:20.400
in some areas that where you can decide what rights people should get and which they shouldn't get.

21:23.840 --> 21:30.400
No clue. So, okay, then maybe you already forgot about that. Our listeners might remember it,

21:30.400 --> 21:37.200
but okay, when you want to allow people to do something, you do that in a license.

21:37.280 --> 21:46.560
Good, so that's the second part. Now, the first part is about, okay, it's actually it's easier

21:46.560 --> 21:54.800
with the new, so if you make money, the non-commercial or commercial licenses. Yeah, so the,

21:56.480 --> 22:01.360
you don't want to make money with, you don't want to allow that people can make money with it.

22:01.360 --> 22:05.440
So, the non-commercial license, yeah, so it was written non-commercial license here.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.360
Well, I thought I can do a shortcut.

22:19.680 --> 22:27.600
I mean, one sec. Could you also, before we move on to the next card, okay? Could you also quickly say

22:28.000 --> 22:35.680
what is commercial? Like, is commercial if I start selling it, is commercial if I get donations?

22:36.880 --> 22:44.080
That's exactly the problem. So, it's not a very easy thing and people should not kind of use it lightly.

22:44.080 --> 22:50.240
I mean, as we've already covered before with the creative comments licenses, it is something where

22:50.240 --> 22:59.440
there's a lot of debate about it, what is covered and what is not covered. And so, in a lot of cases,

22:59.440 --> 23:09.360
the license does not achieve the goal the people had before, while adding a lot of barriers for

23:09.360 --> 23:15.200
people whom they would have liked to benefit from the license. So, if you are very cautious,

23:15.920 --> 23:22.320
then you don't use it because it could be a border case, for example, in the FSFE,

23:22.320 --> 23:29.280
while we could put it maybe on a sticker if we don't sell it and just give it out,

23:29.280 --> 23:35.600
but if we use the same thing on a t-shirt that might be considered commercial, on the other hand,

23:35.600 --> 23:44.800
we are non-profit. So, ah, yeah, not sure. So, we rather not use it. And for others who don't

23:44.800 --> 23:51.840
care that much about the license, you just do it because the enforcement there might be pretty low.

23:51.840 --> 24:00.480
And, yeah, so, it's a bit, for me, one of those licenses where you're preventing something,

24:01.680 --> 24:07.600
or you're trying to prevent something, and by trying to do that, you prevent a lot of good things

24:08.160 --> 24:13.280
you don't want to prevent. A little bit like it, we also had the discussions about

24:14.720 --> 24:20.560
anti-military clauses and licenses, which are also very, very difficult to

24:22.000 --> 24:27.920
clarify what exactly it means, to enforce, and thereby preventing a lot of people from

24:28.480 --> 24:34.160
using the software for great things, which are good for humanity.

24:34.320 --> 24:45.520
All right, thanks, human tears. Okay, I'm going to pick one. Oh, I have to say I did not write all of

24:45.520 --> 24:51.200
them because I also wanted to have some surprises, and then it doesn't spawn off them. It's quite hard for me.

24:55.440 --> 25:03.440
So, it's kind of like you can do mathematical scripts with this language, and it's very commonly

25:03.520 --> 25:08.560
used fun. Pison are. No, no, no, a bit different. It's like you can also

25:09.760 --> 25:16.480
design graphs with it, and it's like people using a lot and do also write papers with it,

25:16.480 --> 25:20.560
if they are really interested, some of three sufferners are really, really interested,

25:21.440 --> 25:30.640
and they just love this type of language to do, to not calculate, but to write scripts with,

25:30.640 --> 25:39.760
for example. Okay, no, not as good running, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay,

25:39.760 --> 25:46.320
the other one I know, which is famous for calculations is Fortran, but I don't guess it's not

25:46.320 --> 25:53.120
calculating. It's not about calculating. It's more about like you can write form you lost with it,

25:53.200 --> 26:00.640
for example, late hack. Yes. Okay, okay, I wouldn't have thought about that at the beginning,

26:00.640 --> 26:11.120
but yeah. Okay, yes, it's already smiling. Yeah, I'm processing the information on the card.

26:11.760 --> 26:24.320
So we have for computers, we have many distributions of operator systems, and for smartphones,

26:25.360 --> 26:34.320
we have them as well, but in a different form and under ROMs, yes, that is the ROM with the

26:34.400 --> 26:44.880
second part of the labes. Yes, custom ROMs. And they can be used to free your phone.

26:44.880 --> 26:51.280
They can be used to free your phone under some circumstances. Yes, so custom ROMs usually

26:51.280 --> 27:01.360
don't support just every phone you might have in your pocket, but they have a list of

27:02.320 --> 27:08.640
phone models that they support, and then you can use custom ROMs to, if the custom ROM

27:08.640 --> 27:14.400
is free software, then you can use the custom ROM to free your phone, basically, yeah.

27:14.400 --> 27:20.720
So many years ago, we started helping people with flashing those custom ROMs on their phones

27:20.720 --> 27:27.440
in our free your Android workshops. And now recently, we had the upcycling Android campaign,

27:27.440 --> 27:35.680
and there we also organized workshops where people can flash free software ROMs on their phones,

27:36.240 --> 27:40.960
and we also had some devices with us there, so people are not lose a little bit the

27:42.880 --> 27:50.800
fear of the contact. Yeah, the fear to modify their expensive device, which is very important

27:50.800 --> 27:56.000
for a lot of people, because a lot of the tasks that the daily tasks are done with the device,

27:56.000 --> 28:00.560
so we also had some devices that were with us where you can test it, and you could install

28:00.560 --> 28:08.400
a replicant, which is an Android ROM that is focusing a lot on being completely free software,

28:08.400 --> 28:15.120
and we also have people with colleagues who ask, which is more like focusing on privacy,

28:16.960 --> 28:24.480
and then also postmarker to ask, which is not an Android, but Knollinox version, then,

28:24.560 --> 28:30.080
to install on operating systems, so we help with those, and also when people

28:30.080 --> 28:34.640
requested some others, we also showed that to them, so that they could try that out.

28:36.480 --> 28:43.040
Awesome. And on the upcycling Android page, we have a list of different custom ROMs,

28:43.040 --> 28:48.560
right, where they can also read a bit more about the custom ROMs, and also find out which one

28:48.560 --> 28:53.200
is more suitable for them, and which one they are interested in.

28:53.200 --> 29:01.520
Yes, we have a list of Android alternatives, because all the custom ROMs I know of are basically

29:01.520 --> 29:08.400
meant for Android phones to be an alternative operation system, and on our website,

29:08.400 --> 29:14.240
we have a collection of nice information on the different ROMs.

29:14.320 --> 29:21.600
Also linked in the show notes. But also like postmarker to ask for other Knollinox operating

29:21.600 --> 29:26.160
systems you can flash there. They are also mentioned there, and we also have video,

29:26.960 --> 29:33.040
some video examples where you can have a look at how this is flashed, also covering from

29:33.040 --> 29:38.320
replicant to colleagues who ask to postmarker to ask, and I mean, they are there also other

29:38.320 --> 29:44.080
operating systems out there that you can use on mobile phones that are out there.

29:44.480 --> 29:49.280
But for those, we want to pick some examples to explain this better,

29:49.840 --> 29:57.920
and why that also helps you to use your phone for a longer time, and thereby be more sustainable.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.400
All right, thank you, and you turn.

30:02.640 --> 30:07.600
Oh, okay.

30:12.720 --> 30:18.720
Well, if you want to buy a train ticket, you go to buy it.

30:20.320 --> 30:20.960
Website?

30:20.960 --> 30:28.720
It's on the platforms, and there are those booth machines, not a word for those machines.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.080
How do you call those machines?

30:32.560 --> 30:33.360
Dispenser?

30:36.320 --> 30:43.120
Okay, and I'll do it the other way. I was using a matte male client before, and the

30:43.120 --> 30:47.360
dead was running in the terminal. Yes, okay. Thank you.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.600
No, I have it. Okay, I get it.

30:51.600 --> 30:58.640
Can you explain very quickly what is a terminal used for how like there are a lot of

30:58.640 --> 31:02.880
terminologies around terminal? I mean, you can buy train tickets.

31:04.240 --> 31:06.960
I just learned you can buy train tickets with them.

31:14.560 --> 31:21.680
Terminals most often refer in the surrounding of new Linux systems to

31:21.840 --> 31:31.760
a program that you can use to interact with your computer, not on a graphical interface level,

31:31.760 --> 31:37.120
where you click on an icon, and then the program starts, but on a textural level.

31:37.120 --> 31:44.880
So you type in some commands, and then those commands are executed, and you get a

31:45.120 --> 31:50.000
different way to interact with the computer.

31:51.280 --> 31:58.480
So it's a way for you to, for example, run commands, and say find me this file.

31:59.200 --> 32:03.520
Yes, or find out this, let me see what's in this file.

32:04.160 --> 32:10.160
Yes, or what's in the directory, or also to copy files from one computer to another

32:10.160 --> 32:15.840
computer, or log into a computer somewhere connected via the internet.

32:17.280 --> 32:24.880
All right. I mean, one thing I like about it is often that at the beginning,

32:24.880 --> 32:31.680
it for beginners, it looks a little bit like not being intuitive or being complicated,

32:31.680 --> 32:38.080
but on the other hand, if you once understand the concepts of it, and what you can do on the terminal,

32:38.160 --> 32:42.800
and how you can connect different programs with each other to accomplish your tasks,

32:42.800 --> 32:51.200
it is also something that is very good to understand and quite intuitive there, while for other

32:51.200 --> 32:58.080
programs, it can be quite difficult to find the right options or the right menu to accomplish

32:58.080 --> 33:04.960
something. So yeah, that's one of the things, which I still think that for depending on what

33:04.960 --> 33:11.440
users you have, that's a very intuitive way of communicating with the computer, and I think

33:11.440 --> 33:18.480
it's also something that helps you to understand how better understand how computers work.

33:21.680 --> 33:26.960
No, I can't totally agree. I have nothing more to add. No questions to all.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.320
All right, you turn.

33:30.480 --> 33:39.040
Okay, this is in my wheelhouse, I guess.

33:41.440 --> 33:50.160
Okay, so when you have a software project, and you have a lot of people,

33:51.440 --> 33:57.280
a free software project, and you have a lot of people who want to submit pull requests,

33:57.840 --> 34:08.960
what is a way to control, oh gosh, and control system. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What is a legal

34:08.960 --> 34:21.040
instrument that you can use to control or manage what they are giving to your software project?

34:21.680 --> 34:24.880
Contributor license agreement? Exactly. Yes.

34:28.240 --> 34:36.960
But if we now want to go into that subject, then the podcast, it's quite a complicated subject,

34:36.960 --> 34:43.520
right? It is. Yeah. Can you really briefly give us an overview about what makes it so complicated

34:43.520 --> 34:50.880
without going into a lot of detail? I mean, I think the, what makes it so complicated

34:50.880 --> 34:58.560
is that whenever you draft, whenever anybody drafts an agreement, it's always about what terms

34:58.560 --> 35:03.600
you want to put in, and different people have different needs regardless of whether it's a software

35:03.600 --> 35:07.760
project or whatever kind of agreement, but let's say in the context of a software project,

35:07.760 --> 35:11.920
different people have different needs, different people want to retain different types of control,

35:11.920 --> 35:19.440
and it becomes whenever you're drafting agreement, the complexity arises because of people

35:19.440 --> 35:25.360
and what they want out of the relationship that they have, right? So I'm just going to leave it at

35:25.360 --> 35:31.280
that and say that, you know, if you're contributing and you're trying to put a pull request,

35:31.280 --> 35:36.240
you might have different interpretations of what you want to get out of that, and then the

35:37.520 --> 35:40.640
project runner will also have different interpretations of what they want to get out of your

35:40.640 --> 35:46.000
contribution and your pull request. So that's where all the complexities arise and I will

35:46.000 --> 35:52.480
leave it at that. All right. Thank you so much. I now have a final question for all of you.

35:53.440 --> 36:01.360
It's a bit of a surprise. You know that every year, every year on the 14th of February,

36:01.360 --> 36:08.320
we celebrate our free software. Yes, and I really like to say because it helps us to reach out to

36:08.320 --> 36:14.240
all those people contributing to free software in different ways, not only by code, but also by

36:14.240 --> 36:22.960
track translation or by opening an issue and reporting a bug or even fixing this bug. Say,

36:22.960 --> 36:30.480
a lot of ways to contribute. And it's very nice to reach out to those people who are behind

36:31.840 --> 36:37.360
those free software projects that we use and say thank you because this really helps to motivate

36:37.360 --> 36:43.680
them. This helps to create a lovely and friendly community. And I would now like to ask you,

36:43.680 --> 36:47.760
if you have a free software project that you would like to say thank you to.

36:49.360 --> 36:57.360
Yes, I will go with to be a first. To be a free software project that you would really like to say

36:57.360 --> 37:10.400
thank you to. It's not a it's not one project. I would like to say thank you to but it's a bunch of

37:10.400 --> 37:22.000
projects that are running under the terms of the Fediverse, contributing to a large decentralized

37:22.000 --> 37:31.440
social networking sphere in the internet that people can join and use free software projects or

37:31.680 --> 37:41.440
mostly free software projects to do social media. So micro blogging or sharing images or

37:41.440 --> 37:55.840
sharing podcasts or stuff like that without being drawn into a wallet garden system of social media

37:55.920 --> 38:01.440
platforms. Thank you. Matthias, is there a free software project that you would like to say thank you

38:01.440 --> 38:10.160
to. Yeah, many. That's always a problem and that's maybe also a nice thing for the I love free

38:10.160 --> 38:18.000
software day at least in the Berlin group we use to have that big round of every people can say

38:18.320 --> 38:28.640
present their loved software project and we always find projects that nobody else has so far heard of

38:28.640 --> 38:39.520
and yeah, that's that's true. It's very good tradition we have there. So but I would still like to

38:39.520 --> 38:44.400
thank some people because I say I love the software day it's not just about thinking like one

38:44.400 --> 38:52.880
project but you can also thank some contributors and I would like to thank all the contributors

38:52.880 --> 39:03.280
out there who are contributing to email software. I think nowadays a lot of people don't value

39:03.280 --> 39:09.920
email as much as they should maybe from how significant it is and I also think that for

39:10.640 --> 39:17.520
quite a time people did not spend that much work on further improving email and making it really

39:17.520 --> 39:23.920
usable for private users but also for for professional users and I'm very happy about those

39:23.920 --> 39:32.480
people who work hard on improving email client software on there for for the for their laptops

39:32.480 --> 39:40.320
or mobile phones but also server software where I think when yeah when more efforts are done you

39:40.320 --> 39:48.400
can really heavily still improve this very reliable system we which was created there and I'm

39:48.400 --> 39:57.360
very happy that at that at I foster them there is this year there is in 2024 now a track about

39:57.360 --> 40:03.520
modern email and so that's something where I would like to to thank all of the people out there

40:03.520 --> 40:10.320
writing good email clients good email server software good tools around email that make it easier

40:10.320 --> 40:18.640
for people to communicate by that with everyone around the world. Thank you. Now Gabriel same question

40:18.640 --> 40:25.200
is there a free software project that you would like to say thank you to. That's tricky. I again I

40:25.200 --> 40:32.800
won't limit myself to one project but as someone who is as terminally online as I am and who

40:33.360 --> 40:40.480
works with a next-generation internet project from the European Commission that seeks to reverse

40:40.480 --> 40:48.480
the end-shedification of the internet as a platform. Yeah I would like to thank all the developers

40:48.480 --> 40:57.280
who are working on like alternatives for internet infrastructure whether it be things like Firefox

40:57.280 --> 41:03.760
you know browsers that you know respect your privacy or just extensions like ad blockers or

41:04.400 --> 41:10.400
things that language apps that that make the internet more accessible to like people around

41:10.400 --> 41:17.840
the world or accessibility features for disabled people blind people for example to be able to

41:17.840 --> 41:26.240
access the internet more readily. Yeah so there's a lot of free software developers involved in

41:26.240 --> 41:32.880
building a better internet to connect everybody and yeah I am very grateful for their work and

41:33.920 --> 41:42.800
all right and Bonnie. No I'm not doing that because I can't take up just one project. Yes it's

41:42.880 --> 41:53.360
reciprocal. Oh gosh okay. There's a contributor to the FSFE that I'm really grateful for and to

41:53.360 --> 42:00.560
also manage just the PETube instance for example I'm appending and to have me out quite a lot with

42:00.560 --> 42:06.640
my free software project ideas because I'm not the best code at all and then yeah I'm really

42:06.640 --> 42:12.800
grateful that he does a lot of work with PETube it takes him hours to update the software but it's

42:12.800 --> 42:19.200
a really great software. I'm not saying anything against PETube. And when Alvar came up you

42:19.200 --> 42:26.160
didn't you cannot see that but Tobias as one of the people from our system team was also starting to

42:26.160 --> 42:34.720
not directly here. I think we can all agree that we would like to thank Alvar. So that's my

42:34.800 --> 42:42.640
ending phrase and now I have done a lot of things. All right I also want to thank you guys.

42:43.280 --> 42:48.240
Thank you for being here today. Thank you for doing the podcast with me. It was a great pleasure

42:48.240 --> 42:54.640
and yeah I hope you all learned a bit more about free software and the terms around free software.

42:54.640 --> 43:02.800
I still have some in my bag. And now it's up to you as the listeners to decide if we should do

43:02.880 --> 43:08.640
this format again in future and if you want to stand in terms so that it's not Bonnie who can

43:08.640 --> 43:15.040
then cheat and know some of the things also she says that she doesn't remember all of them

43:15.040 --> 43:23.600
then we can put it on a fairground. All right thank you so much for listening to this software

43:23.600 --> 43:29.200
freedom podcast episode. This podcast is brought to you by the free software foundation Europe.
