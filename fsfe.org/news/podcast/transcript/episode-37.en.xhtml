00:21.040 --> 00:32.960
I'm Alex Sander, the FSFE Senior Policy Consultant for PELCUS, Andre European Union.

00:33.760 --> 00:38.320
This week, we talk about the cyber resilience act in short.

00:51.520 --> 00:58.960
Hello and welcome to the software freedom podcast. The podcast is presented to you by the free

00:58.960 --> 01:04.480
software foundation Europe. We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

01:05.840 --> 01:10.480
I'm Bonnie Merring and I'm here with my colleague Alex. Hi Alex.

01:10.480 --> 01:16.960
Hi, hi, Bonnie. I'm Alex Sander, FSFE Senior Policy Consultant for PELCUS on the European Union

01:16.960 --> 01:22.320
most of the times and yeah, so this week we want to talk about the cyber resilience act

01:22.320 --> 01:26.320
so the CIA, as I guess you have already heard of it.

01:28.880 --> 01:35.440
I find this short thing very very noticeable to be honest because it sounds like

01:35.440 --> 01:40.160
cra cra cra so funny and it sticks on my head, I have to tell you.

01:41.760 --> 01:44.960
Thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much for walking us through this.

01:45.760 --> 01:52.560
I'm very, very curious to hear more about this very famous and widely discussed act.

01:52.560 --> 01:57.600
So could you give us a short history of this act and then it all started?

01:58.400 --> 02:04.480
Yes, sure. So the cyber resilience act is part of a, so to say, larger

02:04.480 --> 02:10.240
movement of regulations to regulate products in the digital world, so to say.

02:10.960 --> 02:17.360
And the European Union is starting to do this by, or started to do this by looking at the

02:17.360 --> 02:24.720
normal product world and there we know of the so-called CE labels. So you, I guess, pretty much

02:24.720 --> 02:32.080
notice from toys or like every other product basically what you can, what you can find in your

02:32.080 --> 02:37.680
home or somewhere else and these products normally have a CE label printed on it.

02:38.240 --> 02:43.040
And it says, with this label, the product is fine for the European market so there are no

02:43.040 --> 02:49.040
like, I don't know, things in it that harm people. And we didn't have something like this for,

02:49.040 --> 02:52.880
so to say, digital products and that's why the European Union came up with the idea

02:53.440 --> 02:58.560
to put such a CE label also on digital products and by that also on software.

02:59.200 --> 03:05.280
So and this, this, they came up with the AI act, the product liability directive and

03:05.280 --> 03:11.920
the cyber resiliency. And in all of these files, the CE label for the named products have

03:11.920 --> 03:17.200
been introduced. So first of all, it's very important to know we only talk about products.

03:17.200 --> 03:23.360
So it's a product regulation. And the goal of this product regulation is to make products more

03:23.360 --> 03:28.800
secure for the European market. So all of this has been discussed in the aftermath of things like

03:28.800 --> 03:35.680
lock for J or other security incidents. And so this regulation should help to avoid that these

03:35.680 --> 03:41.920
things do not happen too often. And also in this regard, so to make sure that all of this happens,

03:42.480 --> 03:48.880
some sort of like liabilities introduced. So this means if you do not follow the procedures to

03:48.880 --> 03:55.360
put the CE label on your software, you can get fined. Right. So and if the product fails and you

03:55.360 --> 04:01.600
don't have a CE label on it, you are in charge of your product and you have to take the consequences.

04:01.600 --> 04:07.760
However, if you put such a CE label on it and you follow the procedures, then these incidents can

04:07.760 --> 04:12.560
still happen, but you have followed the procedures and this helps us to make the product more secure.

04:13.280 --> 04:18.320
So there is not a liability for like you put a CE label on it and then it fails and then

04:18.320 --> 04:24.000
you are liable, but it is more unlike you didn't follow the procedures. That's why you are not

04:24.000 --> 04:28.880
allowed to put the CE label on it and that's why you are fine. So all in all, what we are talking

04:28.880 --> 04:35.440
about is a product regulation and we want to put CE labels on software. And this of course has

04:35.440 --> 04:41.920
consequences for free software. Since the free software ecosystem is not like a normal product

04:41.920 --> 04:50.800
ecosystem. So how to deal with those lines of code to say. So what happens if a hobbyists come

04:50.800 --> 04:57.360
up with a line of code which then ends up in a car and this car is involved in an accident and

04:57.360 --> 05:05.440
this line of code was maybe for example the issue. So who is then liable? And this is basically

05:05.440 --> 05:11.840
what the cyber resilience I could try to regulate. And in the first place, there was also already

05:12.480 --> 05:18.080
exemption put on the table for free software. So the wording was if you put it on the market,

05:18.800 --> 05:25.440
then there's an exemption for those who do not put it on the market. So and again, there's an issue

05:25.440 --> 05:29.840
with free software. How does it look like? What's the moment when you put something on the market? So

05:29.840 --> 05:35.280
if you put it in a git, is it then that you put something on the market? Yes or no? And this is

05:35.280 --> 05:41.440
something we defined over the last years when the regulation was in the parliament, council and

05:41.440 --> 05:47.440
the commission. So when it was written and we modified this exemption for free software and

05:47.440 --> 05:54.000
introduced more roads. So we are talking about manufacturers that are clearly those who have a

05:54.000 --> 06:00.400
product and who only handle products and have these products with digital elements and end

06:00.400 --> 06:06.880
software on the market. And they produce the code by themselves for example. So then it's a pretty

06:06.960 --> 06:12.480
clear case. But then we are going into this gray area. So as I already explained, what if you take

06:13.840 --> 06:20.320
a piece of code from an individual developer, from an NGO, from charities, or even from hobbyists.

06:21.200 --> 06:28.160
And for those, we introduced some more exemptions. So the so-called Stuart road. So if you

06:28.160 --> 06:33.360
happen to work on a project and you are doing this alone and the manufacturer drops by and just

06:33.440 --> 06:40.400
picks basically your code, then it would be good if there's a relationship between those who are

06:40.400 --> 06:47.280
producing the code and those who picked the code. And for this, we always like, we want to say

06:47.280 --> 06:54.640
like a mantra, we went around and said those who benefit from the use of free software should also

06:54.640 --> 06:59.280
pay. So they should take the burdens. And basically this is what we introduced in the Cyber

06:59.360 --> 07:06.480
Resilient Act. So there are exemptions for individual developers, for charity, for projects,

07:06.480 --> 07:13.200
and so on and so forth. But we want to move them in the Stuart road so that they also help to make

07:13.200 --> 07:19.280
free software more secure and that they support manufacturers that they can come up with a secure

07:19.280 --> 07:25.920
product. But this should happen in a way that the work of these people is valued and that it

07:25.920 --> 07:30.240
not like the manufacturer drops by and say you have to do this and this and this and this for

07:30.240 --> 07:36.000
me, but it should be the other way around. And this is basically what we are discussing at the moment.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.160
So how is this relationship between these Stuarts, so the project, charities, so on and so forth.

07:42.800 --> 07:48.880
And the manufacturer should look like. So we have a regulation which comes up with exemptions for

07:48.880 --> 07:54.960
individual developers. We have this Stuart road for projects that contribute to work of manufacturers

07:54.960 --> 07:59.920
and we have the manufacturers. But the question is like how do they interact with each other?

08:00.480 --> 08:06.160
So and this is not regulated too far. So this is now happening in the so-called implementation.

08:06.880 --> 08:12.640
Yeah, until the end of 2027, when the Cyber Resilient Act enters into force, all of these

08:12.640 --> 08:18.480
questions have to be clarified. And basically this is what we are doing now. So this is our work at the

08:18.480 --> 08:25.440
moment in the Cyber Resilient Act to make sugar that again, our mantra, those who benefit should also

08:25.440 --> 08:31.760
pay that this is also reflected in the implementation. Okay, I do now have two questions actually.

08:33.120 --> 08:38.640
First of all, so you already mentioned that we advocated for a free software exemption.

08:39.360 --> 08:45.120
How did we get involved? And what did we do to further the cost for free software here?

08:45.840 --> 08:53.200
And then I have a more basic question. So I will let you decide in which room to answer.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.400
Oh, right. How do I get a CE label?

08:58.560 --> 09:04.240
Yeah, good question. I'll start with the first one. Since this may be also give you some insights

09:04.240 --> 09:10.800
in how to get a CE label. So basically what we did is that in the first term of also La Fonda line,

09:10.800 --> 09:17.520
it was clear that there will be such a sort of regulation tackling this issue. So we already

09:17.520 --> 09:23.920
started to think a bit about this. Yeah, also had so to say background checks with decision-makers

09:23.920 --> 09:29.840
on this. And once the proposal by the Commission was released, they also went to the European Parliament.

09:29.840 --> 09:34.720
So the members of the European Parliament, so we approached them, the committee working on this

09:34.720 --> 09:40.080
file and the MEPs, so the members of the Parliament, MEPs working on this file and telling them

09:40.080 --> 09:47.520
basically our, yeah, so to say, red line, which was or which still is, so that those who benefit

09:47.520 --> 09:52.960
should also pay. And we also gave them some insight in how the free software ecosystem works and

09:53.680 --> 09:58.400
what would be the result of the proposed regulation by the European Commission. And this is how

09:58.400 --> 10:03.360
we entered the debate. And by that, we also got invited to a hearing in the European Parliament,

10:03.360 --> 10:09.760
where we were able to present our position. And so in this hearing, there were many people nodding,

10:09.760 --> 10:15.200
so it was already good sign that there's an appetite, so to say, to change the proposed

10:15.200 --> 10:20.000
exemption from the European Commission and make this one a bit better. And this took us then

10:20.000 --> 10:26.800
basically until the very end of the debate around the cyber resilience act, so just around the

10:26.800 --> 10:32.880
trialogue, so the final negotiations between Council Parliament with the help of the European

10:32.880 --> 10:39.360
Commission. We were able to change the text massively and to introduce these different roles that

10:39.360 --> 10:44.720
better reflect the ecosystem of the free software ecosystem by introducing the manufacturers,

10:44.720 --> 10:49.040
the stewards and those who are out like individual developers and so on and so forth.

10:49.760 --> 10:58.240
And this definition we made clear how roles are defined and how a CE label could be put on a

10:58.240 --> 11:04.720
product. So it's always the manufacturer who can put a CE label on the product. So the manufacturer,

11:04.720 --> 11:11.120
so the one entity that is then finally coming up with a product, that's the entity who needs to

11:11.120 --> 11:17.680
take care of the CE label. So it's not the individual development, no charity, no anyone else,

11:17.680 --> 11:23.520
it's only those who put something in the birth of the European Commission on the market and earn

11:23.520 --> 11:30.880
money with this. So and for this, there are also several applications what to do. So you have,

11:30.880 --> 11:37.280
for example, you have to have an incident management, also you have to follow standards and ultimately,

11:37.280 --> 11:46.080
there will be guidance and attestation and all of this. So how do you bring a product to attestation?

11:46.080 --> 11:53.200
So how do you make it do your diligence? How do you set interact with the Stuart to make sure that

11:53.200 --> 11:58.080
you get all the needed information to fulfill your applications under the cyber resilience act?

11:59.040 --> 12:04.240
This is something which is ultimately defined now. So I give you an example. So it's clear that

12:05.360 --> 12:10.480
let's assume you have a project and in this project, somebody finds a security incident.

12:10.480 --> 12:16.800
So the question is who is in charge of fixing this? So the manufacturer might not be able to fix it

12:16.800 --> 12:22.240
since it's a project. So but the manufacturer should inform the project and should help the

12:22.240 --> 12:29.120
project to make sure that the security incident is fixed. This could happen since everything is

12:29.120 --> 12:35.760
free software that the manufacturer is just doing this by its own and provides a bug fix of design.

12:36.800 --> 12:43.360
So and then this patch have to be available to everyone. So it's not possible that the manufacturer

12:43.360 --> 12:48.560
is just doing this for his own so but for everyone. So the other way around would be and that's

12:48.560 --> 12:52.960
probably the most easiest one is that the project is doing that by themselves and then by

12:52.960 --> 13:01.280
us also is distributing this patch to everyone. So and precisely this situation, I do believe that

13:01.280 --> 13:06.720
the manufacturer should support the project that this could happen. This could be financially,

13:06.720 --> 13:11.600
that could be with resources, but it should never be that the manufacturer is just dropping by at

13:11.600 --> 13:17.120
the project and say do this for me. And expecting that the project is doing this.

13:17.840 --> 13:22.880
So and precisely this is something which is not clearly defined in the cyber resilience

13:22.880 --> 13:27.440
act so how this should work out. The cyber resilience act just say it needs to work out.

13:28.640 --> 13:34.240
And this is basically how we continue our efforts so how we further advocate around the cyber

13:34.240 --> 13:42.320
resilience act and a market surveillance authority will check and will guide on how to do this.

13:43.120 --> 13:47.680
So Germany for example, that's the Bundesamt for society in the information station,

13:47.680 --> 13:55.280
so the agency for cybersecurity or basically you can check the NISA website or that's basically the

13:56.000 --> 14:00.960
umbrella organization for all cybersecurity organizations in the European Union member states.

14:01.520 --> 14:07.120
So these are most likely the ones who will be the market surveillance authority in the member

14:07.120 --> 14:12.480
state. You can compare with the data protection. You have a data protection law and the one

14:12.480 --> 14:17.120
following the laws are the data protection officers in the member states. So that's pretty much

14:17.120 --> 14:21.760
the same workflow for the cyber resilience act. So you have the rules on the cyber resilience

14:21.760 --> 14:27.760
act in the market surveillance authority will check if these rules are followed. This means they can

14:28.240 --> 14:34.880
go to the market by a product check it and see if the CE label procedures are fulfilled and if so

14:34.880 --> 14:40.880
everything fine if not they go to the manufacturer and tell them you have to fix this and maybe

14:40.880 --> 14:46.720
can you find them. That's why it's so important to talk to market surveillance authorities at the

14:46.720 --> 14:52.720
moment since they are the ones who then automatically cannot be the workflow and those are the ones

14:52.800 --> 14:58.240
telling you how they will check what they will check and based on what and for this they will come

14:58.240 --> 15:04.480
up with so called guidance. So next to standards that you have to follow there's also guidance on

15:04.480 --> 15:10.880
how the market surveillance authority is telling you what you should do in order to be out. You can

15:10.880 --> 15:15.600
also come up with completely different procedures so you can interpret the cyber resilience act for

15:15.600 --> 15:20.240
your own. Come up with something and say this is a procedure to come up with the CE label

15:21.200 --> 15:26.480
or you follow the guidance of the market surveillance authority and the European Commission

15:26.480 --> 15:32.880
where you can say look I did precisely what you wrote here in order to make sure that the security

15:32.880 --> 15:40.960
issue is fixed for example or that it's reported to the important agencies and so on and so

15:40.960 --> 15:46.640
forth. So I fulfilled my obligations and I did so by following the guidelines of the European

15:46.640 --> 15:52.400
Commission and the market surveillance authority and that's why guidance is so important since here

15:52.400 --> 15:57.920
we can define how these workflows should look like and that's why we are not talking to like

15:57.920 --> 16:03.360
decision makers like members of the parliament anymore on this since they already voted for them

16:03.360 --> 16:10.480
it's done but we need to talk to those who are around this implementation and this is how we

16:10.560 --> 16:19.360
for the advocate and how we further make sure that I have the feeling I have the feeling you are

16:19.360 --> 16:28.480
hinting at something that we will talk about in a few seconds absolutely absolutely I just I just

16:28.480 --> 16:34.560
want to put one more question there I hope to do so right here I'm sorry for interrupting you all

16:34.560 --> 16:42.480
right so as you already mentioned companies using free software products or free software

16:43.600 --> 16:50.800
projects that are developed by others and they are then putting them into money basically so

16:50.800 --> 16:59.680
they are the manufacturers yes but they are multiple of them using for example curl or

17:00.400 --> 17:08.320
open SSL so all of those projects that are like the foundation of our daily life and that are

17:08.320 --> 17:16.960
free software who of them is now reliable and who like build a BSE in Germany or the other market

17:16.960 --> 17:23.120
authorities establish a clear role here and what is your take on this yes so I'm not a lawyer

17:23.120 --> 17:29.600
but as it's looking now since you since you mentioned this example let's let's walk on this let's

17:29.600 --> 17:37.120
walk this through so a curl is most likely a steward so they are not a manufacturer and they are also

17:37.120 --> 17:44.160
not a hobbyist project so this means they are somehow in the middle and as you said a lot of people

17:44.160 --> 17:51.760
and products and yeah basically our digital is relying on them so that makes it important for them

17:52.320 --> 17:59.920
to be in this steward role but as we have already seen manufacturer was dropping by and said look

17:59.920 --> 18:05.120
I have this and this and I want to learn from you how you fulfill the applications from the cyber

18:05.120 --> 18:09.840
research experience so that I can put my CV on the product and this is basically how it should

18:09.840 --> 18:16.320
not block out the answer by the curl people was yeah fine fine please let's sign a support contract

18:16.320 --> 18:20.640
and then we can work on that so pay for this and then we can give you the information

18:21.280 --> 18:27.120
and this is how it should look like so and this is basically also what we want to put into

18:27.120 --> 18:34.720
guide and also I mean on these roles it's still not really clear they are certain thresholds are

18:34.720 --> 18:40.800
so I give you another example let's assume you are a hobbyist that comes up with a project and then

18:40.800 --> 18:48.080
you are asking for a bimeo coffee donation so then money is involved and the question is it

18:48.080 --> 18:55.600
is then a product so I'd say no and many other people also do say no and now we are discussing where

18:55.600 --> 19:02.240
could be the threshold and I think it's around living cost so it's most likely that we say it will

19:02.240 --> 19:08.800
circle around living cost so everything below this threshold is completely out and has to do

19:08.800 --> 19:14.800
nothing however you can still say you want to go in this steward position and you want to come up

19:14.800 --> 19:20.720
as a business model for example and say I want to create these support contracts and

19:21.520 --> 19:26.800
since you may be learn from the cyber research that there are many manufacturers using you

19:27.520 --> 19:34.560
code right so however back to the curl thing you are now a steward and you learn are these are my

19:34.560 --> 19:40.800
manufacturers and there might be many coming to you and there might be many that are not too nice

19:40.800 --> 19:47.120
so and this is basically what we are trying to regulate now or what we are trying to fix in

19:47.120 --> 19:53.600
implementation is to make clear that it should never be the steward who is just doing work for free

19:53.600 --> 20:00.000
for manufacturers but again those who benefit should pay and this mantra again also is guiding us

20:00.560 --> 20:04.880
through this implementation and that is why we are talking to the European Commission

20:04.880 --> 20:10.240
who is basically coming up with these thresholds for example and also again to market surveillance

20:10.240 --> 20:17.520
authorities who then help us to to understand first of all how this market is working and that they

20:17.520 --> 20:23.040
also understand where the problems are just described are happening and that they are happening

20:23.040 --> 20:29.680
and then we need to come up with a wording to fix this so and that's basically in a nutshell

20:29.680 --> 20:35.520
what we are doing now and which is also still not completely clear also the European Commission

20:35.520 --> 20:40.640
has if something should fail in this regard the possibility to come up with so-called

20:40.640 --> 20:47.120
delegate acts they are in the cyber resilience act some implementing acts so they will happen

20:47.120 --> 20:52.880
no matter what the example for this is the regulation around s-bombs so the software bill of

20:52.880 --> 20:59.040
materials so the cyber resilience act is saying we you you need to have as an obligation right so

20:59.040 --> 21:06.080
you need to have a s-bombs and this s-bombs should be basically state of the art so but this could

21:06.080 --> 21:12.720
be everything right so and that's why the European Commission said okay we won't do this in the cyber

21:12.720 --> 21:20.320
resilience act itself but we come up with a implementing act this means in the next month the

21:20.320 --> 21:25.920
European Commission will come up as a proposal how this state of the art is looking like and how this

21:25.920 --> 21:32.160
s-bombs ultimately should look like so and that's also such a discussion which is not completely

21:32.160 --> 21:40.160
done the same is true for how these roles should interact and if for example we do not manage this

21:40.160 --> 21:47.600
and this we I do not mean the FCE but the all the circles of people discussing the cyber resilience

21:47.600 --> 21:55.360
act at the moment and we do not come up with a working solution for the obligations to be fulfilled

21:55.920 --> 22:01.280
or that they can be fulfilled by the throughout any manufacturer then there is a possibility for

22:01.280 --> 22:06.720
the European Commission to come up with a so-called delegated act so they are allowed to also regulate

22:06.720 --> 22:13.200
this so and this also gives us a bit of pressure to come up with a with a solution by ourselves

22:13.200 --> 22:18.080
which is working for everyone since if we are not coming up with something like this

22:18.080 --> 22:23.520
they might be delegated act and then it's a bit more difficult to yeah get your word in

22:24.240 --> 22:28.400
since the European Commission is then basically yeah if you want just deciding I mean they will

22:28.400 --> 22:33.040
also have to run consultations and so on and so forth and also one has to say the European

22:33.040 --> 22:38.480
Commission since the very beginning so even with the first 12 never had the intention to harm

22:38.480 --> 22:44.080
free software ecosystem so that's not what the cyber resilience act is about they do not want to

22:44.080 --> 22:50.320
harm free software ecosystem they do not want to harm micro and small enterprises

22:50.960 --> 22:56.400
and they just want to make sure there is more cyber security and with this they mainly have

22:56.960 --> 23:03.120
big tech in the eyes so they are looking at larger companies who do not care about cyber security

23:03.760 --> 23:10.080
and it's also not too much that they target only the tech sector but it's also banking insurance

23:10.080 --> 23:15.840
car industry and then so on and so forth that are mainly using this but do not care about

23:15.840 --> 23:21.280
cyber security so and that's also something which you should have in mind right so that's not

23:21.280 --> 23:26.640
that they are after and again that's why we need to talk to market surveillance authorities

23:26.640 --> 23:31.520
it's not like that they are after the small micro enterprise that makes mistakes somewhere

23:31.520 --> 23:37.200
and then find them to death it's rather that they are looking for products that are largely distributed

23:37.200 --> 23:42.720
where they fear there is not enough cyber security and again you can compare this with data protection

23:42.720 --> 23:47.680
so it's not like that the data protection officer is after the small bakery around the corner

23:47.680 --> 23:52.800
it's rather that they are after google making sure that they handle your data correctly

23:52.800 --> 23:59.520
so and this is also how you can look at cyber resilience act so they will be after those who failed

23:59.520 --> 24:06.240
on a large scale and not much about like what the what the smart enterprise is doing in a tiny

24:06.240 --> 24:11.680
corner of the of the internet press I don't know 20 customers or something like that still that

24:11.680 --> 24:17.280
doesn't mean that you are free to do whatever you want so you should also look at the cyber resilience

24:17.280 --> 24:26.240
act but here or there you have not that large fines for example for small and micro enterprises

24:26.240 --> 24:31.120
as if you are a larger enterprise right so it's pretty balanced and it's pretty clear

24:31.920 --> 24:37.680
whom they are targeting and mainly they talk about mass markets and want to bring in security

24:37.680 --> 24:43.360
in those mass markets so that's the main aim and then there will be evaluation of the cyber

24:43.360 --> 24:49.040
resilience act also and in five and six years we will see if it's working out or if we have to

24:49.040 --> 24:56.240
reform something and if so then we will do this or else we say look on a large scale it's working fine

24:56.240 --> 25:04.080
let's proceed thank you so much for this interaction of the crab I do now have a question how are we

25:04.080 --> 25:10.880
engaging with the market awareness agencies and is there something that the thing is that for us

25:10.880 --> 25:18.000
it's very very important to learn how in particular so these projects are working together with

25:18.000 --> 25:25.200
manufacturers what they want what they need but also maybe there are already some examples already

25:25.200 --> 25:30.560
out there and I'm sure there are I know there are examples out there where projects are working

25:30.640 --> 25:35.760
together already with manufacturers where they are basically already doing what the cyber resilience

25:35.760 --> 25:42.480
act is asking for which we can then reuse as a blueprint for this guidance I just mentioned

25:42.480 --> 25:47.280
but also what we want to see examples and that's why this curl example you just mentioned is so

25:47.280 --> 25:53.360
important where we can showcase and say look this is how the reality looks like a manufacturer

25:53.360 --> 25:59.840
just dropping by at the store and it's asking for no costs for work for them to do so and this is

25:59.840 --> 26:04.720
not how it should look look like so this is the example it's we are looking for at the moment

26:04.720 --> 26:12.000
so good and best practices as well as we have it's also completely failed and with these examples

26:12.000 --> 26:19.040
we want to try to influence guidance and it could happen and it's also very likely that this guidance

26:19.040 --> 26:24.480
is also coming its examples to make it more clear what we are talking about so since the free

26:24.560 --> 26:32.160
software ecosystem is pretty unique it's sometimes very difficult to describe in words how

26:32.160 --> 26:37.840
something should look like in particular since there are many gray areas so and it could be that

26:37.840 --> 26:46.320
we for this guidance are using examples so and these examples then are it's something which helps

26:46.320 --> 26:51.280
us a lot to make clear in this guidance what should happen and what should not happen and for this

26:51.920 --> 26:58.400
we together with the BSI so the German market surveillance authority for the cyber resilience

26:58.400 --> 27:05.280
act worked on a questionnaire in the last month and just released this in the beginning of

27:05.280 --> 27:12.960
beginning of July it was this survey is now running for two months where we are asking in particular

27:12.960 --> 27:18.960
stewards or potential stewards how they look at the cyber resilience what they fear what they

27:18.960 --> 27:26.080
already maybe experienced and what they want and with this you can help us a lot if you first of

27:26.080 --> 27:31.920
all if you are a project or if you are potential stewards then through this survey so we will put it

27:31.920 --> 27:38.400
in the show note and the more and the more evaluated answers we get the better we can influence guidance

27:38.400 --> 27:43.520
so basically we are also looking for people who are a bit familiar with the cyber resilience act

27:43.520 --> 27:49.680
already so to make sure that yeah exempt that there are exemptions for those things that should

27:49.680 --> 27:55.600
be exempted but also that we define workflows for manufacturers and stewards where we can make sure

27:55.600 --> 28:01.920
that those who benefit also pay and that it's not the burden of stewards or the project to work for

28:01.920 --> 28:07.600
free from manufacturer so that's something we want to avoid also to believe that's what most of

28:07.600 --> 28:14.240
the people are trying to avoid in this fear of markets wellness authorities and you think mission

28:14.240 --> 28:20.640
and so on and so forth so again they do not want to harm but in order for them to know where they harm

28:20.640 --> 28:27.360
we need those examples and this is where we are asking you I do believe that we from this debate

28:27.360 --> 28:34.400
we were running have a good overview of those but there are so many yeah gray areas or niches

28:35.040 --> 28:39.840
that we do not see or that we might do not see at the moment and therefore you could help us a lot

28:40.480 --> 28:45.840
if you point us to these examples if you show us these examples if you provide us with this

28:45.840 --> 28:52.240
so that we can then implement those in our work or the implementation to make sure

28:52.240 --> 28:59.840
the safeguard the free software ecosystem the questionnaire is running until the end of August

28:59.840 --> 29:07.600
however if you contribute very very quickly we might also include your feedback in the talk we are

29:07.600 --> 29:13.200
giving at the frostcon so the biggest free software conference in Germany happening in mid-August

29:13.200 --> 29:21.040
in an august team near bond in Germany where Michael from the BSI and me are presenting the first

29:21.040 --> 29:28.000
results of this survey where we want to discuss with you the community how we look at this and then

29:28.000 --> 29:34.240
ultimately after the end of august then we have all answers we will come up with a final report

29:34.240 --> 29:43.280
and use this report then to to advocate further around the implementation and are also going to

29:43.280 --> 29:48.720
present these results at a conference in Christen the so-called Dattensperen conference which is

29:48.720 --> 29:55.040
then happening with September and with these talks as well as the results of the of the survey

29:55.600 --> 30:02.160
we will further make sure that every software is safeguarded in this implementation so you can

30:02.160 --> 30:08.240
pretty much help us a lot if you contribute by first of all it will be seen by the market surveillance

30:08.240 --> 30:14.480
authority directly since the FFFE and the BSI is working here together we have good chances that

30:14.480 --> 30:20.000
they not only see it but also listen to it and the more convincing we are they might even follow

30:20.720 --> 30:26.960
and again you will find the link in the show notes there is also I mean not only for Stuart but

30:26.960 --> 30:32.960
also for manufacturers there is a questionnaire and also for yeah just project who do not leave

30:32.960 --> 30:38.080
that they are Stuart so for all of these roles so we have three questionnaires if you are unsure

30:38.080 --> 30:45.040
just pick one and there are many free fields so feel free to put your answers in the free field

30:45.040 --> 30:49.680
also you do not have to answer every question so questions you do not understand or where you

30:50.480 --> 30:58.960
do not have anything to say skip them and if there is more you can just use the free field or

30:58.960 --> 31:07.360
drop us a message via contact at FFFE.org or directly to me Alex.Sound at FFFE.org and we will make

31:07.360 --> 31:15.360
sure your input is channeled into the evaluation so it's also a BSI discussion there if you

31:15.440 --> 31:21.200
free to reach out to us directly and talk about your pain and then we will try to make sure to

31:21.840 --> 31:27.120
yeah bring it into implementation so the more you give us the more we can help you.

31:29.440 --> 31:32.480
All right thank you so much Alex thank you so much for walking us through this.

31:32.480 --> 31:36.320
Thanks for thanks for having me giving me the time and room to talk about it.

31:38.480 --> 31:44.320
Always a pleasure it's always a pleasure I also learn a lot about all those acts that I have

31:44.400 --> 31:52.560
been reading on for the past years so I'm always happy to have you. You remember last time like in

31:52.560 --> 32:00.480
July where we called for feedback on the transcript. Yes I want to say thank you to all our listeners

32:00.480 --> 32:07.680
who reached out to me and gave ideas and feedback on it and I'm looking into this I will take some

32:07.680 --> 32:15.280
time but I will work on improving the transcript and a big thank you and shout out to all our

32:15.280 --> 32:23.200
listeners that got in touch with me. Thank you. Yeah that sounds pretty good yeah that sounds

32:23.200 --> 32:31.280
pretty good so also same for me let's see how we can improve it very nice. Yeah all right thank

32:31.280 --> 32:36.560
you so much Alex for being here thank you so much for taking the time as always it was a pleasure

32:36.560 --> 32:41.680
and I'm very much looking forward to our next episode in September. Same here.

32:43.680 --> 32:49.520
This was the software freedom podcast if you like this episode please recommend it to your friends

32:49.520 --> 32:55.520
and read it stay tuned for more inspiring conversations that explore the importance of software

32:55.520 --> 33:02.320
freedom and its impact on our digital lives like the crowd. This podcast is presented to you by the

33:02.320 --> 33:07.440
Free Software Foundation Europe. We are a charity that works on promoting software freedom.

33:08.000 --> 33:14.640

you can share the podcast on social media rated or contribute to the fsfe's work as a volunteer

33:30.640 --> 33:35.920
or by answering the questionnaire about the cyber resilience act. Thank you so much to your

33:35.920 --> 33:42.080
listener for listening to us and I look forward to be back in your ears in September then again.

33:42.960 --> 33:53.680
Bye bye. My name is Florian I've been a volunteer with the fsfe since 2012 and I continue volunteering

33:53.680 --> 33:59.680
for the fsfe because whenever I have an idea and I approach someone about it and I say I'm willing

33:59.680 --> 34:17.600
to do the work people actually let me and I find that very motivating.
