    <h1>Free Society Conference and Nordic Summit 2012</h1>

    <p id="introduction">
      <a href="http://www.fscons.org/">FSCONS</a> is the largest gathering for free culture, Free Software and a free society in the Nordic countries. It is proudly co-organised by the Free Software Foundation Europe. An unparalleled mix of international speakers will convene to discuss the process of liberating society with the principles of Free Software. FSFE will host its own track there about "General Purpose Computing".
    </p>
    
  
    <p>
      Again, the FSFE will be hosting its own track at FSCONS. Our five talks form a series entitled 'General Purpose Computing', and will end with a panel discussion including the President of the Free Software Foundation Europe. 
    </p>

    <p>
       Computers and - more and more - portable devices are universal machines, that - in theory - you can program to do whatever you want. But several IT companies have another understanding of computing and sell their hardware with anti-features or user-restrictions to actively prevent users from doing whatever they want. These (re-)sellers want to arbitrarily limit what we as a society can do with general purpose computing machines.
    </p>

    <p>
They use for example <a href="http://drm.info/">Digital Restrictions Management</a> and technical measures, to take away rights from us, which we usually received when we buy a product. This industry wants to decide what we can do with computers, so they can maximise their profits. But the biggest price is the threat to users freedom as well as to Free Software in a whole. 
    </p>

    <p>
This years talks that will be given in the "General Purpose Computing" track by the FSFE, will focus on this ongoing and increasing process of users restrictions. They concentrate on current trends and what we are in need of to stop them.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Talks</h2>
    
    <p>As soon as the detailed schedule of FSCONS is set up, you will find more information here.</p>
    
    <h2>Workshops</h2>
    
    <p>
      FSFE will host a Free Your Android workshop at FSCONS: Android is a mostly free operating system mainly developed by Google. Unfortunately, the drivers for most devices and most applications from the "market" are not free as in Free Software. They frequently work against the interest of the users, spy on them and sometimes can not even be removed.
    </p>

    <p>
Therefore, the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) launched its <a href="http://freeyourandroid.org">FreeYourAndroid</a> campaign, to help users to regain full control of their device and their data. This workshop helps you in setting up an alternative Android-based free operating system. You will no longer be in need of a Google account and you get to know F-Droid, a Free Software App repository, instead. 
    </p>
    
   
    <h2>Free Software Booth</h2>
    
    <p>
      FSFE's Free Software Booth will be located at the entrance of the FSCONS conference building. As well as the opportunity to join the <a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org/">FSFE Fellowship</a> and buy books and Free Software goodies, you'll also be able to meet FSFE staff and get answers to questions about all aspects of Free Software and what the organisation does.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      FSFE warmly welcomes you to come and visit the booth.
