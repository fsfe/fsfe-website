      <h2 id="OS">The Operating Systems</h2>
      
      <p> 
        An operating system is a collection of software that enables you to use
        your phone and run other applications on it. Even though Android is <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html">mostly
        free</a>, many phones ship with proprietary components and add-ons. Some
        phones also have a locked <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting#Boot_loader">boot loader</a>
        which prevents you from booting and installing other operating systems.
        If you want to buy an Android phone, make sure that the boot loader can
        be <a
        href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/?search=&quot;unlock+bootloader&quot;">unlocked</a>.
        On some devices it can only be unlocked with clever hacks. There are
        also companies that ship their devices with an unlocked bootloader or
        provide you with the means to unlock it. Besides that, it is a good idea
        to check if there are free versions of Android <a
        href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices">supporting the device</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Replicant OS</h3>
      
      <p>
        <a href="http://replicant.us/">Replicant</a> is a distribution of
        Android that is 100% Free Software. It runs only on <a
        href="http://replicant.us/supported-phones/">a very limited number of
        devices</a>. If you have one of these devices, then this is your choice.
      </p>
      
      <h3>CyanogenMod</h3>
      
      <div class="image right">
        <img alt="CyanogenMod" src="/campaigns/android/cyanogenmod.png" />
      </div>
      
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">CyanogenMod</a> is the most
        popular aftermarket distribution for Android. It <a
        href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices">runs on many phones</a> and
        offers <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/about/features">features</a>
        not found in the official Android based firmwares of vendors. It also
        ships without Google applications and gives you more freedom over your
        device. CyanogenMod is Free Software developed by an active community.
        It still requires 
        <a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_semc_iyokan/blob/gingerbread/proprietary-files.txt">non-free
        device drivers and firmware</a> which are 
        <a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_semc_iyokan/blob/gingerbread/extract-files.sh">fetched
        from a device</a> and are included in the ROM.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In order to install CyanogenMod, your device's boot loader needs to be
        unlocked. Some manufacturers consider your warranty void when you've
        unlocked its boot loader. The <a
        href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Main_Page">Wiki of
        CyanogenMod</a> contains detailed instructions on how to install it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        After the installation, your phone will be freed from all those
        pre-installed proprietary applications and there will be no need to
        connect your phone with a Google account. With the exception of some
        non-free device drivers, your phone should run only Free Software. If
        you know about non-free software added to CyanogenMod, please <a
        href="mailto:android&#64;lists.fsfe.org">let us know</a> about it! There
        is a DRM provider app that you can <a
        href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Barebones">remove</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="Apps">The Apps</h2>
      
      <p>
        For most people, the <a href="https://market.android.com/">Google
        Android Market</a> is the only or the main source for their
        applications. It doesn't even tell you whether an app is Free Software
        or not, let alone its license. Unfortunately, most apps from this or
        other markets are proprietary. Even if you install a Free Software app,
        there is no reason to trust the downloaded binary. Using the Google
        Market also requires a Google account. It is recommended to not use this
        market at all.
      </p>

      <h3>F-Droid</h3>

      <div class="image" id="hello-free-droid">
        <img alt="F-Droid" src="/campaigns/android/f-droid.png" />
      </div>

      <p>
        The <a href="http://f-droid.org/">F-Droid initiative</a> was started to
        change the sad Free Software app situation in the Android world. It
        builds a repository of easily-installable Free Software for the Android
        platform. There is an Android client application that makes it easy to
        browse Free Software applications, install them onto your device, and
        keep track of updates. When available it includes information about how
        to donate money to the authors of the app.
      </p>

      <p>
        The F-Droid repository contains details of multiple versions of each
        application. You can also easily create and add own repositories. But
        since the initiative is <a
        href="https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidserver">very active</a>,
        developing in a decentralised fashion and open to collaboration,
        creating own repositories it not really necessary. Its goal is to
        include all useful Free Software Android applications and to keep up
        with their updates.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can help to make F-Droid <a
        href="https://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=3789">preinstalled
        on CyanogenMod</a> so more people can benefit from a free market.
      </p>

      <h4>Adding Apps Yourself</h4>

      <p>
        You are encouraged to add applications yourself. There is a long queue
        of <a
        href="http://f-droid.org/forums/forum/submission-queue/">applications
        that wait to be added</a>. Adding them works similar to <a
        href="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html">FreeBSD ports</a> and <a
        href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/handbook/handbook.xml?part=2&amp;chap=1#doc_chap2">gentoo
        ebuilds</a> by filling a simple recipe file which controls how a package
        is build from source. If you like to add apps yourself, you should read
        about <a
        href="http://f-droid.org/forums/topic/adding-apps-with-git/">how F-Droid
        works with git</a> and <a
        href="https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidserver/blobs/master/README">how
        to write these so called metadata files</a>.
      </p>


      <h2 id="Sync">Synchronising Your Data</h2>

      <p>
        When you run only Free Software and when you do not rely on non-free
        network services like the ones Google offers, you lose the convenience
        of synchronising your contacts, your calender and other data with your
        other devices. Fortunately, there is plenty of Free Software that does
        this job as well:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://acal.me/">ACal</a> synchronises your Android
          addressbook and calendar to <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a>/<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV">CardDAV</a> servers like
          <a href="http://owncloud.org/">ownCloud</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://code.google.com/p/kolab-android/">kolab-android</a>
          synchronizes your Android addressbook and calendar to <a
          href="http://www.kolab.org/">Kolab</a>/IMAP folders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
          href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Howto:_Connect_to_Device_with_SSH">SSH
          Daemon dropbear</a> is pre-installed on CyanogenMod and can be used to
          e.g. run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
