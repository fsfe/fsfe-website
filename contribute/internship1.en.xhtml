<h2>Join the revolution</h2>
<h1>Interships at the Free Software Foundation Europe</h1>
</center>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is looking for an intern to
join our team, beginning from August 2006.</p>

<p>FSFE operates in a lively environment of numerous volunteers from many
countries and several full-time employees. The geographic focus of the
internships will be ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.</p>

<p>Before starting with the details, a few words from former FSFE interns:</p>

<p>&quot;FSFE is involved in the most important processes on how Information
Society is being shaped, be it on a national, European, or on a global
level. It's exciting to be part of these activities.&quot;<br />
<i>Alexander Finkenberger</i></p>

<p>&quot;If you've followed my <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/en/fellows/gerloff/blog">blog</a>, 
you will have an idea of what I did
with my time. The FSFE is a great place to work, and I've enjoyed almost
every single day. In few other companies or organisations would I have
had the chance to do useful work and learn in an international context
like I did here. Take this chance, if you can.&quot;<br />
<i>Karsten Gerloff</i></p>
