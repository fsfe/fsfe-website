      <h1>TUX&amp;GNU@school - 4th edition</h1>

      <p><i>Every month the column <a
      href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/activities/education/tgs/tgs.en.html">TUX&amp;GNU@school
      [2]</a> reports about free software, a homepage on the topic
      and an easy to implement idea. This month I talk about <a
      href="http://bioinformatics.org/ghemical/">Ghemical [3]</a>,
      modelling und computing molecules, about <a
      href="http://www.seul.org/edu">seul.org/edu [4]</a>, the
      education portal of SEUL - Simple End-User Linux and about
      the idea "word games generated rapidly".</i></p>

      <p>Welcome to the 4th edition. As I promised last time, there
      are some news today. This is the first edition released under
      the roof of the <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org">Free
      Software Foundation Europe [5]</a> and <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU [6]</a>. In this context
      TUX&amp;GNU@school will be released in different languages in
      the future but right now only in German and English. At this
      point I want to thank Christian Selig and Kristian Rink for
      their support with writing and translating. Unfortunately
      there is no report about a school using GNU/Linux and/or Free
      Software in this edition. I hope that next time I find
      somebody and I likewise will upgrade the <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch/nav.php?site=99">Questions Page
      [7]</a> and translating of course. And again, sorry for the
      latenese. The reason is easy: It a lot of work (too much for
      a hobby) promoting and installing (!) GNU/Linux at Swiss
      schools. But now we're talking about a topic everyone loves:
      Chemistry.</p>

      <h3>Ghemical - Modelling and computing molecules</h3>

      <p><a href="http://bioinformatics.org/ghemical/">Ghemical
      [3]</a> is a free program for chemistry, which is relatively
      easy for modelling and computing molecules. I tssted the
      version 0.82 under <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian
      GNU/Linux 3.0 [8]</a> and <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE
      2.2.2 [9]</a>. You can easy install the program under Debian
      with the command <tt>apt-get install ghemical</tt>. Version
      0.90 is up to date and if you can trust the homepage, they
      want to release the version 1.0 in this summer (that's
      becoming scarely) or autumn. The program is (and was)
      developed by several people, all listed alphabetically on the
      homepage.</p>

      <p>Before I begin with the introduction to Ghemical I want to
      mention yet: Unfortunately my last chemistry teacher took my
      interest for this subject so I can't interpret all terms
      correctly. But who is bothering intensifiedly with this
      subject will understand it much better. That's the reason why
      I'm not going in the depth of each term and function.</p>

      <p>Starting the program a window quite similar to the first
      screenshot will appear. That's the main window from where you
      appoint what will be the project you work on. Up to now
      quantum and molecular mechanic models and reduced protein
      models are available whereas the last one isn't completely
      implemented yet. When you start Ghemical it is most useful
      doing this out of a terminal because it is still necessary to
      make some in- and output on the terminal. But this feature
      shall disappear with the version 1.0. Working with the
      program the menu panel and the popup menu are the most
      important aids. The menu panel owns three items: <i>File</i>,
      <i>Windows</i> and <i>Help</i>. It's important to mention now
      the program isn't really translated to German. There are only
      scattered terms, words and descriptions in German. In the
      menu item <i>File</i> you can open projects, load already
      existing ones and exit the program. At <i>Windows</i> it is
      possible to choose between the following three MDI modes:
      <i>Notebook</i>, <i>Toplevel</i> and <i>Modal</i>. And
      finally in the last item <i>Help</i> you find either general
      information about Ghemical or a link to the
      documentation.</p>

      </p>

      <h5>Screenshot 1: Ghemical with aspirin</h5>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p>If you decided for a project at the left brink are a lot
      of modification possibilities to work with. These differ from
      different rotation and translation directions over the
      zooming unless the erasing and adding of atoms and bindings
      of course. Clicking on the prompt window for the molecules
      with the right mouse button a popup menu appears which
      contains different items depending on the project. To mention
      are for instance the different presentation possibilities.
      Proceeding the single atoms can be indexed differently.
      Surely it's interesting too that you can plot the molecules
      in different ways among others there is a display for 3D
      glasses build in. This popup menu contains then too the basic
      functions for saving and closing the projects. The choice
      between between different elements and bindings is possible
      here too. Beneath these simple function there are more
      complex ones too. <b>Where the correct adding of hydrogen
      atoms every reader still understands menu item as
      "ESP-colored vdW-surface" isn't only imcomprehensible for the
      author.</b> At this item the interested user and ongoing PhD
      will hopefully understand it. Principally there is a huge
      number of different engines and algorithms for studying and
      changing the molecules. They seem to be quite professional
      for me as layman. The possibility of generating DNA molecules
      out of an easy "ACGT code" is absolutely noticeable for
      me.</p>

      <p>At the end some tips (mainly from the <a
      href="http://bioinformatics.org/ghemical/">homepage [3]</a>)
      that can help you with the daily usage.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>For the generation of a quantum mechanic model
        principally it is more meaningful to generate a molecular
        mechanic one first which then you can transform in a
        quantum mechanic one.</li>

        <li>All menu panel are freely relocatable and placeable
        outside of the main window too.</li>

        <li>There are a lot of import and export formats available
        for molecular mechanic models.</li>

        <li>If you are forced using Windows at work then you can
        find a <a
        href="http://bioinformatics.org/ghemical/cygwin.html">detailed
        description [10]</a> about the usage of Ghemical under
        Windows.</li>
      </ol>
      And for those who are still wondering at the end of this
      short description how you have to pronounce "Ghemical" can
      find an answer in the statement of an developer which says
      that generally everybody can pronouce it as he or she want
      but the "G" comes from "GNU" and/or "GNOME". <br />
      <br />
       

      <p>But now continues to the home of Simple End-User
      Linux.</p>

      <h3>seul.org/edu, the education portal of SEUL - Simple
      End-User Linux</h3>

      <p><a href="http://www.seul.org/edu">SEUL/edu [4]</a>
      subproject of <a href="http://www.seul.org">SEUL [11]</a>
      stands for "Simpel End-User Linux". The goal of SEUL is
      making available an as easy as possible GNU/Linux system for
      every user. Thereby qualitatively good software shall arise
      which preferably will be released under the terms of the <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL [12]</a>.
      To manage and assist this the site is hosting a lot of <a
      href="http://www.seul.org/pub/hosting.html">projects [13]</a>
      and makes available mailing lists for the coordination of the
      work. Main language in this project and on the website too is
      English.</p>
      The subproject school and education was founded in 1998. Doug
      Loss is the leader at the moment and Karl Peña is managing a
      lot of stuff on the <a href="http://www.seul.org/edu">website
      [4]</a>. Beneath these two there are a lot of other
      freelancers too. In principle SEUL/edu mainly consists of a
      mailing list whose access is already described on the
      frontpage and you can subscribe right there too. <br />
      <br />
       

      <p><img src="./img/seul-edu.en.png"
      alt="Screenshot 3: The homepage of SEUL/edu" width="800"
      height="600" border="0" /><br />
      </p>

      <h5>Screenshot 3: The homepage of SEUL/edu</h5>
      <br />
      <br />
       

      <p>The homepage of the project is devided in seven sections.
      They are: <i>Current projects</i>, <i>Existing software</i>,
      <i>Case studies</i>, <i>Documentation</i>, <i>Regular
      reports</i>, <i>List archive</i> and <i>Links</i>. There is
      only one <a href="http://seul.org/edu/projects.html">project
      [14]</a> now under the first item whose goal it is making
      available an ISO-Image containing a counterbalanced
      collection of education software. But the development stands
      still at the beginning and we will see what will happen with
      it. However the database with already <a
      href="http://richtech.ca/seul/">existing software [15]</a> is
      remarkable by all means and I never saw such a big one in the
      internet yet. At the moment the database contains 518
      software projects arranged by categories believe it or not.
      There is a short description for each entry. Additional and
      optional information are: version, date, author, homepage,
      download URL and the used license of course. Accessorily it
      is possible showing only predetermined data as the license or
      a the short description. Important for the further growth is
      the easy way to enter new software which is accomplished
      through a <a
      href="http://richtech.ca/cgi-bin/seul/seuladd0.pl">form on
      the website [16]</a>. You can search the entries either for a
      destined application or a pretermined word. But don't forget
      there is not only Free Software in this database. Because the
      people of SEUL/edu collected and catalogued already so much
      software it would possibly make sense that other projects use
      this database too, integrating it in their webpages and
      expand it. A translation in other languages would expand the
      circle of possible users again.</p>

      <p>They who are searching reports about schools using
      GNU/Linux and/or Free Software making a find here too.
      SEUL/edu offers <a
      href="http://casestudy.seul.org/cgi-bin/caseview0.pl">reports
      [17]</a> of more than 50 schools worldwide. There are a few
      from Cuenca in Ecuador to Marl in Germany. It is possible to
      easy make new entries with a <a
      href="http://casestudy.seul.org/casestudy.html">form [18]</a>
      on the website. Under <a
      href="http://seul.org/edu/docs/">documentation [19]</a> you
      don't find as much at the moment. There is already a
      classification for the documenation in the future which
      contains sections as the <i>Users guide</i> or the
      <i>Teachers guide</i>. Even a category helping
      decision-makers and people who want to persuade schools of
      GNU/Linux and/or Free Software is available. But SEUL/edu
      lists <a
      href="http://seul.org/edu/docs/relateddoc/index.html">foreign
      documentation[20]</a> in the same structure too. At the
      moment there is a helping description for people who want to
      write documentation for one of the named categories.</p>

      <p>The project itself releases an extensive report about the
      situation of GNU/Linux and Free Software in and at schools at
      least twice a month. The since the beginning of 2000
      published reports are of course archived on the site <a
      href="http://seul.org/edu/reports.html">[21]</a> so that
      everyone can read them at any time. Because SEUL/edu mainly
      works and communicates over the mailing list they made an
      archive of the list available <a
      href="http://archives.seul.org/seul/edu/">online [22]</a>
      too. And finally under the last item you can find an
      extensive <a
      href="http://seuldat.seul.org/cgi-bin/link/urlview.pl">links
      collection [23]</a> to further sites about the theme
      "GNU/Linux, Free and Open Software in and at schools".</p>

      <p>But now, let's continue with the idea of this month.</p>

      <h3>"Word games generated rapidly"</h3>

      <p>For the last idea, concedely a little skinny one, I didn't
      receive any implementation because of this continues to the
      idea of this edition. Because the ideas introduced until now
      were always more or less for learning or teaching at the hard
      everyday school life I want to present an idea for loosing
      today. Riddles, an invention fascinating and entertaining
      humankind since billions of years, can prettify school a
      little. Even children find pleasure and happiness with
      riddles and guessing games. I think about a quite special
      kind which seems to be rather simple to implement and program
      too. What I mean is a letters huddle containing different,
      mostly thematically coherent words. The task is to search and
      find these words in the mix-up. Mostly the letters are
      disposed in an rectangle in which the to finding words are
      placed horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Thereby the
      searching words can be written forward or backward.</p>

      <p>Perhaps there is already a piece of software generating
      such riddles. And if not such a thing would be implementable
      in short time, isn't it ? A little bash script putting words
      of a definite category into a letters huddle. Writing this
      letters sequence with some <a
      href="http://www.latex-project.org">(La)TeX [24]</a> commands
      into a text file and translating it would result in a quite
      good-looking riddle for pupils her excercices already
      finished. And the best, if you select correlatively the word
      collection pupils even learn the correct orthography or
      understand the context between the single word families.
      Anyway I'm curious about the ideas you will create. Farther
      ideas were for instance that words are written correctly and
      wrong in the letters mix-up or you make the whole thing with
      numbers.</p>

      <p>Once again at this place the calling to send <a
      href="mailto:foxman@lugo.ch">me [1]</a> ideas which you think
      are easy to implement or you didn't find comparable software
      yet, then I will report about them at this place in one of
      the next editions. And perhaps there are firms, schools or
      single persons offer a reward for an implementation.</p>

      <p>But now continues to a new section.</p>

      <h3>News and up to date program versions</h3>

      <p>In the future I will report in this section about news of
      GNU/Linux and Free Software at school. Beneath I will list
      actual program versions of free education software for the
      moment only of the programs I already reported about in
      TUX&amp;GNU@school. Software whose version changed since the
      last edition will be highlighted in red.</p>

      <h4>DebianEdu:</h4>

      <p>On 6th of september Raphael Hertzog announced the birth of
      DebianEDU a subproject of <a
      href="http://www.debian.org">Debian [8]</a>. Interim goal of
      the project is it making Debian the best available
      distribution school purposes. At the moment they impetuously
      dicuss on the <a
      href="http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe">mailing
      list [25]</a> how they want to go on the first tasks and what
      has priority. You can find more information under <a
      href="http://wiki.debian.net/DebianEdu">[26]</a>.</p>

      <p>Mario Fux finished 1999 the PrimarlehrerInnenseminar in
      Brig after he made up mathematical and natural scientifical
      matura. In a body with two colleagues he founded the <a
      href="http://www.edux.ch">"ALIS - Arbeitsgruppe Linux an
      Schulen"</a> (Swiss work group for linux at school).
      Meanwhile he studies at the <a

      Technology Zurich</a> <a
      href="http://www.ee.ethz.ch">informations technology and
      electrical engineering</a>. And if he once doesn't spend his
      time in front of the PC, he sits at his nature pond in the <a
