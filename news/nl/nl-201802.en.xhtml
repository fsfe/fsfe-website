	<h2 id="barcelona-is-the-first-city-council-to-join-the-fsfe-s-public-money-public-code-campaign">Barcelona is the first city council to join the FSFE&#39;s &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; campaign</h2>

	<p newsteaser="yes">&quot;Funds that come from the citizens have to be invested in systems that can be reused and open to a local ecosystem&quot; says Francesca Bria, Commissioner of Digital Technology and Innovation of Barcelona. She is the driving force behind the City&#39;s Digital Transformation Plan, which - among other things - aims to establish the use of Free Software and open data in the city&#39;s administration.</p>

	<p>Step by step, all key applications shall be replaced with Free Software solutions until the city finally replaces its currently running Windows-system with a suitable GNU/Linux-system. Therewith, Barcelona is heading to achieve and guarantee <a href="http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/digital/en/digital-transformation/technology-for-a-better-government/open-software">&quot;complete technological sovereignty&quot;</a> for the municipality. By spring of 2019, when its municipal term of office ends, the City Council has planned to spend 70 percent of its software budget on open-source software.</p>

	<p>With this in mind, Barcelona has been the first city council to sign the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/#action">Open Letter</a> of our &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; campaign. The FSFE is very pleased to see one of European&#39;s biggest metropolitan areas moving to Free Software, and we wish Barcelona much success!</p>

	<h2 id="i-love-free-software-day">I love Free Software Day</h2>

	<p> Every year, our community celebrates &quot;I Love Free Software Day&quot; on February 14. Our report from this year&#39;s celebration is coming soon but we like to say thank you for hundreds of love declarations via social media channels, pictures of people celebrating their favourite Free Software projects like <a href="https://twitter.com/developersITA/status/964060999899860992">Developers Italia</a>, beautiful artworks <a href="https://grisebouille.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tad_024_ilovefs.jpg">like the one from Grise Bouille</a> as well as multiple blog posts informing about the benefits of Free Software. We even found people <a href="https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/issues/866">opening issues on project&#39;s development platforms</a>, just to say &quot;Thank You!&quot; on &quot;I love Free Software Day&quot;. </p>

	<p>Thank you for celebrating with us and stay tuned for the detailed report coming soon.</p>

	<h2 id="what-else-have-we-done-inside-and-outside-the-fsfe">What else have we done? Inside and Outside the FSFE</h2>

	<ul>
	<li>The day before FOSDEM, the FSFE once again partnered up with OpenForum Europe for <a href="/news/2018/news-20180215-01">the third edition of European Free Software Policy Meeting</a> to discuss the most important current policy issues on European level regarding Free Software.  </li>
	<li>The FSFE country team Italy is running an <a href="/news/2018/news-20180219-01">&quot;Ask your candidates&quot; campaign</a> and sent a set of questions about the use and promotion of Free Software to the participating parties of the Italian national elections, happening on March 4.</li>
	<li>The &quot;besondere elektronische Anwaltspostfach (beA)&quot; is publicly financed software aiming to establish a secure communication between lawyers in Germany from January 2018. Its usage, however, is currently being withheld  for multiple security issues. The FSFE <a href="/campaigns/publiccode/bea">published an open letter</a> to demand the full publication of beA under a Free Software license.</li>
	<li>At the 34th Chaos Communication Congress the FSFE, together with EDRi, set up a cluster called “Rights &amp; Freedoms” with its own freedom related track. Erik Albers <a href="http://blog.3rik.cc/2018/02/fsfe-assembly-at-34c3-wir-taten-was/">wrote a report about it on his blog</a>.</li>
	<li>Daniel Pocock, the FSFE community representative, writes about <a href="https://danielpocock.com/everything-you-didnt-know-about-fsfe-in-a-picture">Everything you didn&#39;t know about FSFE in a picture</a> in which he analyses overlapping relationships between staffers, Council, community and the General Assembly. </li>
	<li>Vanitasvitae <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/vanitasvitae/">reports</a> about his trip to XSF-summit, FOSDEM and the importance of XMPP libraries</li>
	<li>Daniel Pocock distributed an <a href="https://danielpocock.com/our-future-relationship-with-fsfe-2018">email to the FSFE community</a> in that he reflected the GA membership process, the FSFE&#39;s identity process and his personal travels.</li>
	<li>Sebastian Schauenburg shares his insides on sharing <a href="https://www.schauenburg.nl/posts/2018/01/26-local-osmand-and-geo-urls/">local OsmAnd and Geo URL&#39;s</a></li>
	<li>Polina Malaja, the FSFE&#39;s policy analyst, writes about our <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/polina/2017/12/13/fsfe-asks-to-include-software-into-the-list-of-re-usable-public-sector-information/">response to the PSI Directive public consultation</a> that in short asks to include source code into the list of re-usable public sector information.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2 id="do-not-miss-it-upcoming-events-with-the-fsfe">Do not miss it! Upcoming events with the FSFE</h2>

	<p>We are happy to see a first local FSFE meet-up happening in Madrid, Spain, on <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/2018/0222-encuentro-local-madrid#head-03d1f2ac6d4d5cbd79007a7f665302c522d7d2b4">February 22</a> and on <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Events/2018/0303-encuentro-grupo-local-madrid#head-3778ef44968968dd3aaa71135b6e78f7b37dc6d0">March 3</a>.
