		<h1>The Structure of the Legal Network</h1>
		
		<p id="introduction">The Legal Network was originally a single mailing list. Over the years the needs of the group have changed and brought to the creation of additional groups that make the participation in the Network easier and more productive.</p>
		
		<!-- LN mailing list -->
		<h2>The Legal Network mailing list</h2>
		
		<p>The core activites of the Legal Network (LN) happen through the main mailing list. There the LN members can communicate with each other, ask their questions, propose discussions and test their ideas freely, inside the <a href="/activities/ftf/ln-rules.html">limits</a> posed by the Legal Network Code of Conduct, the Chatham House Rule and the general netiquette.</p>
		
		<!-- SIGs -->
		<h2 id="sigs">The Special Interest Groups</h2>
	
		<p>The Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are created when a number of members feel like a topic deserves special attention. SIGs have their own separate mailing lists and a dedicate Chairman that leads the discussion. While all activitiy of the SIGs are under the same rules that govern the Legal Network, due to their very specific topics, they might invite non-LN members to join. Such members will not have access to the Legal Network main discussions.</p>
		
		<p>The creation of SIGs is discussed among the other <a href="/activities/ftf/ln-rules.html#creating-sigs">Legal Network procedures</a>.</p>
		
		<!-- FSFE, LT and the Network Coordinator -->
		<h2 id="fsfe">The role of the FSFE</h2>
		
		<p>The FSFE acts as a facilitator for the Legal Network, providing technical infrastructure and coordination support. The day-to-day operations on the Legal Network are performed by FSFE's <a href="/about/team.html">Network Coordinator</a>, with the support of the FSFE's <a href="/activities/ftf/legal-team.html">Legal Team</a>. The Legal Team is a group of voluteers that helps FSFE with regard to its legal positions; most (if not all) the members of the Legal Team are also part of the Legal Network.</p>
		
		<p>Regardless, the Legal Network maintains its independence and the opinions expressed there do not necessarily reflect the position of the FSFE. The FSFE will not intervene to push the Legal Network towards a specific position and reserve its right to take different stances.</p>
		
		<!-- Council of the LN -->
		<h2 id="council">The Council of the Legal Network</h2>
		
		<p>The Council of the Legal Network has been created to allow the Network a higer degree of self-government. It operates with a collaborative attitude and takes into account input from various sources, including the interested parties, prominent members of the Legal Network and the FSFE.</p>
		
		<p>The Council is charged with drafting the prospective evolution of the Legal Network and operates as an <a href="/activitites/ftf/ln-rules.html#appeals">appellate body</a> for the decisions taken by the Legal Team.</p>
		
		<!-- Mentors of the LN -->
		<h2 id="mentors">The Mentors of the Legal Network</h2>
		
		<p>The Mentors mailing list<a class="fn" id="1" href="#1">1</a> is an additional list that has been designed to help new members participate in the discussion. Members of the Legal Network that have a question but are unsure wether it is relevant or if it has been asked before, can contact <a href="mailto:mentors.ln@lists.fsfe.org">mentors.ln@lists.fsfe.org</a>; a small group of expert members of the Legal Network will receive the request and reply in private.</p>
