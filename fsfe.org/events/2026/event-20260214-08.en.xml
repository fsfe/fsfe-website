      <p>For our series of events related to software freedom we are happy to invite everybody interested to our <a href="https://ilovefs.org">"I Love Free Software Day"</a> event in Oxford! It's a great time to get involved with and help out the FLOSS communities that develop projects in the interest of everyday people, by everyday people.
