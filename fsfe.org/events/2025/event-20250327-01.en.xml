    <p>Join us for an inspiring day in the spirit of free and open-source software! The Danish branch of the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE-DK) invites you to the premiere of the Danish 
    version of the animated film &quot;Ada &amp; Zangemann&quot; at the Øst for Paradis cinema in Aarhus on 27th March from 15:00 to 17:00. The event starts at 13:00 (CEST) with a screening of the 
    film for schools only and opens its doors to all interested people at 15:00 (CEST). ”Ada &amp; Zangemann – A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream” was originally created 
    as a children's book in 2021 by Matthias Kirschner, the president of the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE). It is a story that conveys the need for the right to use, share, study, and 
    improve software in a way that is easy to understand for both children and adults. It is an optimistic story about innovation and technological independence, which is highly relevant today.</p>
    <p>After the film, there will be a panel discussion featuring Matthias Kirschner, the author of ”Ada &amp; Zangemann,” where we will discuss the film’s message in relation to topics such 
    as the need for free and open-source software in schools and its role in both public and private sectors. Participation is completely free.</p>
