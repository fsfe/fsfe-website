  <h1>Call for sessions "about:freedom" during 36C3</h1>
  
 	 <p newsteaser="yes">In the context of the 36th Chaos Communication Congress happening from December 27th to 30th in Leipzig, the FSFE is happy to host an assembly again inside the cluster "about:freedom". We offer attention and a stage for self-organised sessions by and for our community and friends, and this is our call for participation.</p>

	<p>For our sessions at the FSFE assembly, we are looking for inspiring talks, hands-on workshops, community/developer/strategy meetings or any other public, informative or collaborative activities. Topics can be anything that is about or related to Free Software – from your private project to global community projects. While we welcome submissions on technical topics, we also further encourage non-technical talks that address philosophical, political, economical, and/or other aspects regarding Free Software, particularly for this year related to digital sustainability. As part of our <a href="https://signup.c3assemblies.de/assembly/c8c9adf9-0fb7-43a6-bc73-8e5d2201a3c1">cluster about:freedom</a>, we also look forward to sessions about related subjects that have a clear connection to Free Software, in particular privacy, data protection, encryption, the commons and internet policies.</p>

	<p>For our friends, it is also possible to have informal meetings, announcements or other activities at our assembly. In this case, get in touch and we will see what we can do. If you are a musician and like to help forming our first <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:%22Join_us_now_and_...%22_sing_together_the_Free_Software_song">Free-Software-song sing-along</a> big band, please also get in touch.</p>
