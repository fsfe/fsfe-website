      I am a strong supporter of the ideas behind free software and a daily
      user of free software. I think a voice that explains why Free Software is
      good for society and what are the conditions under which the Free
      Software ecosystem can grow is vitally important. By joining FSF and
      FSFE, I wanted to say thanks to free software advocates and developers
      and help in maintaining political conditions that allow and favor free
      software development and use.
