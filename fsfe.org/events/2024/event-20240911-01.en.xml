      <p>In this workshop we will dive into the possibilities of encouraging women*, especially girls, to thinker and to code. With tools such as the Free Software Foundation Europe’s (FSFE) illustrated book “Ada &amp; Zangemann” The book tells the story of Ada, a girl who loves to experiment with hardware and software. Ada realises how crucial it is to control technology and decides to stand up to the mighty inventor Zangemann. This workshop will also intend to explore ways to promote diversity and gender equity in the Free Software community and beyond. <br />
Together we will identify the challenges women face in participating in such communities and discuss how we can create more inclusive environments, especially for the future generations. We encourage you to join us to share your experiences, ideas and perspectives, and collaborate in creating a more inclusive and diverse future in the Free Software community for all.</p>
