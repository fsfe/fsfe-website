    <title>Erik Albers talks about research software and digital resources in Potsdam, Germany</title>

    <body>
      <p>Since research is usually directly or indirectly financed by public funds, it is obvious to publish this research software under free licenses, so that everyone can benefit from public software. The Free Software Foundation Europe has adopted this simple principle under the slogan "Public Money? Public Code". Erik Albers will discuss the basics of this campaign at the Conference for Research Software Engineers in Germany and how they can support sustainable software management and consumption.</p>
