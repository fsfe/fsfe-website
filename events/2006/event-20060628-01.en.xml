    <title>GPLv3 and Free Software Development, GUADEC, Spain</title>
    <body>
      Ciaran O'Riordan will give an overview of the current proposal
      for how v3 of the GNU GPL will differ from v2.  Topics will
      include a description of the year-long public consultation
      process and how GPLv3 will strive to preserve freedom in spite
      of DRM, software patents, and a complicated legal World.
