    <title>CANCELLED: Digitale Souveränität und Modernisierung der öffentlichen Verwaltung in Berlin, Germany</title>


    <body>
      <p>On 4 May 2020, the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) invites to the event "Digital Sovereignty and Modernisation of Public Administration". During the event we want to present successful Free Software projects in public administration from a provider perspective (morning) as well as discuss the administrations' view on Free Software projects (afternoon). The breaks will be used to give interested people the opportunity to talk to each other in the context of an exhibition. Participation in the event is free, but registration is welcome.</p>

      <p>ATTENTION: This event has been canceled to help slowing down the spreading of COVID-19 virus.</p>
