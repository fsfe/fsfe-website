      When I read the term "Intellectual Property" I always suspected it to be
      a "contradictio in adiecto", because only something physical can be
      possessed, intellectual ideas can not. To get the best benefit out of
      ideas for all, they should be spread as wide as possible and with as few
      restrictions as possible. The GNU General Public License seems to be a
      good example for such little restriction, especially the inheritance
      principle prevents possible misuse of the idea about Free Software.
      Following these ideas in an ethical way, for me the FSFE seems to be the
      very best NGO to be found. And so I support them. And I only found kind
      people here.
