        <title>Upcycling Android workshop in Cologne in Cologne, Germany</title>

    <body>
      <p>Together with developers from PostmarketOS we are organizing another Upcycling Android workshop to happen on 03 June in the Alte Feuerwehrwache in Cologne, Germany. The workshop is about bringing tech enthusiasts and sustainability enthusiasts together and exchanging views on technology and sustainability while flashing phones with Free Software operating systems. We want to give a place for all questions you have and bring different phones to test different settings. We will bring devices with us on which you can try flashing phones or you can bring your own phones. In the case of the latter, we would ask you to clarify with us in advance whether the devices you have brought with you can be supported. A short keynote speech on longevity and sustainability on Android and other devices. </p>
      <p>We have two rooms for the workshop. In  one room the actual phone flashing with custom-ROMs take place while in the other room there will also be the chance to join the developers in a come together and learn about how to contribute to the GNU/Linux mobile operating system PostmarketOS. The workshop takes place from 16:00 - 20:00 in Alte Feuerwache Köln, Melchiorstraße 3, 50670 Köln. Everyone is welcome to join, participation is free, but please register because space is limited. </p>
