<h1>FSFE Newsletter - June 2012</h1>


<h2>Free Software, Open Source, FOSS, FLOSS – Same same but different</h2>

<p newsteaser="yes">There are two major terms connected to software that can
be freely used, studied, shared and improved: Free Software and Open Source.
You can also find different combinations and translations of those terms like FOSS, Libre
Software, FLOSS and so on. Reading articles about Free Software or listening to
people involved in Free Software often raises the question: Why do they use one
term or another and how they differ from each other? </p>

<p>Long time FSFE volunteer Björn Schiessle wrote <a
  href="http://blog.schiessle.org/2012/05/11/free-software-open-source-foss-floss-same-same-but-different/">a
  good article</a> about this topic, how to deal with the different
terminology.</p>


<h2>State neglected web standards, company now faces EUR 5600 in fines</h2>

<p>In Slovakia, the state has mandated electronic means as the only way of
fulfilling certain statutory obligations. However the dedicated web solution
excludes some citizens from participating as it is not interoperable and runs only on the
non-free software from one vendor. In absence of any non-electronic option, this means
that the state mandates the use of a certain product from a certain
vendor. People who did not own the copy, had to buy one. A Slovak textile importer
deemed that the state should not force him to use a certain software for its
business and fulfilled its legal obligation by paper. Now the company faces EUR
5600 in fines.</p>

<p>Current FSFE intern Martin Husovec decided this is not just and made it 
his internship project to change it: he is working on the case, reading
court files, wrote <a
  href="/news/2012/news-20120509-01.html">FSFE's press release</a>, and an <a
  href="/news/2012/news-20120509-02.html">executive summary of the EURA
  case</a>. He is motivated to ensure that no one is forced to use certain
non-free software in Slovakia just to fulfil the law, and will 
<a href="/news/news.html">keep you updated</a>.</p>



<h2>Will the UK be lobbied into the FRAND trap?</h2>

<p>Free Software could be blocked from the UK's public sector use if the new
policy allow <a
  href="/activities/os/why-frand-is-bad-for-free-software.html">"FRAND" terms</a>
within British standards. As recently revealed by 
<a href="http://www.freedomofinformationrequests.co.uk/" title="Freedom of Information Requests">
  Freedom of Information Requests</a>: Intensive lobbying efforts have focused on pressuring 
the Cabinet Office to back down on a strong definition of Open Standards over the past few
months.</p>

<p>FSFE is trying to counter this development. In May the <a
  href="/news/2012/news-20120528-01.html">FSFE asked North-West UK businesses
  to tell Government that Open Standards matter</a>, and we will continue to
work on the case.</p>


<h2>Democratic elections with non-free software?</h2>

<p>In France, the <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2012/news-20120525-01.html">
  FSFE has raised its concerns (French)</a> on the online voting process
implemented for French electors registered abroad. FSFE strongly criticised the
complete lack of precautions, the opacity of the voting process, and the
request to use proprietary software to vote.</p>


<h2>Something completely different</h2>

<ul>

  <li>"My cooking can't be a copy of your cooking." Richard Stallman wrote a
  new article <a
    href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/network-services-arent-free-or-nonfree.html">"Network
    Services Aren't Free or Nonfree; They Raise Other Issues"</a>.</li>

  <li>This <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/fellowship-interviews/?p=590">month's
    Fellowship interview</a> is with Giacomo Poderi, member of FSFE's general
  assembly, has worked as a translator and editor for FSFE, as well as
  completing a masters degree in Philosophy. Currently he is working on a Ph.D
  in sociology, which looks at the user experience in Free Software Projects,
  focusing on the turn-based strategy game "The Battle for Wesnoth".</li>

  <li><a
    href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/spains-basque-countrys-administration-share-all-its-software">According
    to joinup</a>, software written by or for public authorities and public
  organisations in the Basque Country will by default be made available to
  others as Free Software starting this July.</li>

  <li>What happens with licenses when the licensor gets insolvent? <a
    href="http://www.ifross.org/artikel/vorschlag-des-ifross-insolvenzrechtlichen-fragen-bei-oss-lizenzen">
    IfrOSS wrote a proposal (German)</a> about insolvency questions with Free Software
  Licenses, which FSFE also supports.</li>

  <li>Open Standards: "How did we get to a point where we will pay for the
  'privilege' of having a vendor take our data and lock it up such that we have
  to pay them, again and again, to access it?" asks Jake Edge from LWN in his
  article <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/496418/">"Who owns your data?"</a>.
  Will you "rebel" at next year's <a href="http://documentfreedom.org">Document
    Freedom Day</a>?</li>

  <li>In the lawsuit Oracle vs. Google FSFE's <a
    href="http://piana.eu/java-verdict">Carlo Piana</a> and <a
    href="https://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-statement-on-jurys-partial-verdict-in-oracle-v-google">FSF's
    John Sullivan</a> published articles covering the topic.</li>


  <li>A selection from the <a href="http://planet.fsfe.org">Fellowship blog
    aggregation</a>:

  <ul>

    <li>Fellowship representative <a
      href="http://roussos.cc/2012/05/14/liberate-your-cloud-data/">Nikos
      Roussos gave a speech</a> about Free Software solutions 
    that can be used for self-hosted web services.</li>

    <li>Georg Greve does "not believe that Windows is the future of the Free Software
    desktop." Sounds obvious? Is it? Here is his blog article <a
      href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/greve/?p=505">"A bridge leading nowhere:
      Outlook-centric groupware"</a>.</li>

    <li>Clean, playful, wide use in Free Software, out-of-the-boxiness. 
    Fellow Karl Beecher argues
    <a
      href="http://computerfloss.com/2012/05/why-choose-python-for-teaching/">why to
      choose Python for teaching</a> .</li>

    <li>FSFE's vice-president <a
      href="https://sandklef.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/examples-in-manuals-how-to-verify-test-them/">is
      hacking on Searduino</a>, a software to make it easy to program C/C++
    for Arduino. It is also a simulator for source level Arduino API so it is possible to 
    directly test executable code without the Arduino board present, and it can even do more.</li>

    <li>Or are you looking for a good configuration for your tiling window manager?
    Fellows shared their configuration files for <a
      href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/h2/2012/05/05/my-awesome-wm-config/">Awesome</a>,
    and <a
      href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/thomaslocke/2012/05/05/my-xmonad-wm-config/">xmonad</a>.</li>

    <li>Beside that Hannes Hauswedell wrote about <a
      href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/h2/2012/05/12/improving-e-mail-privacy/">improving
      e-mail privacy</a> by removing header information when using GnuPG and
    Thunderbird, and</li>

    <li>Isabel Drost explains how to ruin software projects fast and rapidly. E.g. by referring  
    developers as resources, not not investing in tooling, or <a
      href="http://blog.isabel-drost.de/index.php/archives/389/geecon-failing-software-projects-fast-and-rapidly">by other suggestions</a>.</li>
    
    <li>Finally, if you have the problem that one of your presentations is
    still too long, she also has suggestions <a
      href="http://blog.isabel-drost.de/index.php/archives/385/presentation-shortening">
      how to shorten it</a>.  </li>

<h2>Get Active: PDFReaders 2.0 – Your help is needed!</h2>
  
<p><a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/petition.html">Our petition</a> is signed by
72 organisations, 57 businesses, and 2327 individuals. The Green party filed an
<a
  href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/parliamentary-questions-eu.html">oral request in
  the European Parliament</a> (5 questions) , and <a
  href="http://gruen-digital.de/2012/03/document-freedom-day-kleine-anfrage-laesst-bundes-cio-gegen-adobe-reader-werbung-taetig-werden-jetzt-mithelfen/">
  in the German Parliament </a> (18 questions with introduction). The German
agency for IT security is recommending <a
  href="http://pdfreaders.org">pdfreaders.org</a> in their new migration guide
and highlights that you should not advertise for non-free software readers. And
539 public administrations removed the advertisement for non-free software,
which is a success rate of 25%.</p>

<p>After long discussions and considerations the PDF readers team is now
preparing a major update to PDFReaders.org, adding: a more appealing and
cleaner front-page, with one recommendation for the auto-detected platform;
free pdf reader recommendations for mobile platforms; and free pdf browser
plugin recommendations.</p>

<p>Please have a look at the current <a
  href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/PDFreaders/todo2012/Overview-Page">reader
  overview and the TODOs there</a>, and <a
  href="mailto:feedback@pdfreaders.org">tell us</a> if you know any other free
PDF reader that we have not listed, and which Android reader you would
recommend.</p>
