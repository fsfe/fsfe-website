    <title>Open letter to Minister Moratti</title> 

    <body>
      <p>Uncorrect and misleading information is being given to the
    160,000 enrolled into For TIC (Training Plan for Information and 
    Communication Technology Teachers).
    FSF Europe Italy, heard by the Italian Government Commission on free 
    software in the public administration, asked Minister Moratti not to 
    hinder schools from adopting free software, which is more suitable than
    proprietary software to both teachers and students.  </p>
