    <title>Software patents: A bad day for Europe</title>
    <body>
      <p>
"Europe is about to finally give up on the goal of its heads of states
  and governments to become the 'most competitive knowledge-based
  region' until 2010 and has repeatedly failed democratically. It is
  unfortunate that the optimism and trust placed in the German
  government was somewhat premature. Yesterday was not a good day for
  Europe and Germany!"
