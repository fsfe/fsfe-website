			<p>
			Android is a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html">mostly free</a> operating system mainly developed by Google.
			Unfortunately, the drivers for most devices and most applications from the "market" are non-free.
			This campaign collects information about running an Android system as free as possible
			and tries to coordinate the efforts in this area.

		<h2>Political Background</h2>
		
		<h3>Free Software</h3>

		<p>
		Smart-phones are small computers that we carry around all the time.
		Most smart-phones are not controlled by the users, but by the manufacturer and the operator.
		The software that runs on them is not Free Software.
		Even Android phones ship with non-free software and proprietary add-ons that usually do not work in the full interest of the user.
		Software updates will only be made available when the manufacturer still has a commercial interest in your device.
		The applications (apps) available from the official market are most of the time non-free.
		Nobody is allowed to study how they work and what they really do on your phone.
		Sometimes they just don't work exactly as you want, but sometimes they even contain malicious features.
		</p>

		<p>
		Running only Free Software on your device puts you in full control.
		Even though you might not be able to directly exercise all of your freedom, you will benefit from a vibrant community that can do it together.
		</p>

		<h3>Privacy</h3>
		
		<p>
		Our mobile devices contain more personal information than most private diaries.
		But proprietary systems, even most Android phones, are designed to leave this data in control of companies like Google or Apple.
		Most users do not have full control over the personal data on their device.
		Convenient solutions for cloud-based synchronization and data backup trick more and more people
		into storing all their data on centralized servers run by some commercial organisation.
		Whoever has personal information about us is able to manipulate us.
		Therefore non-free devices are a threat to democracy and our society.
		</p>

		<p>
		Privacy is one of the most important reasons to support Free Software.
		Proprietary add-ons like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_IQ">Carrier IQ</a> spy on smart-phone users without their knowledge.
		Many apps from the market contain malicious features.
		They read your private data and "phone home",
		or they use <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/mobile/android.html#overview">Google Analytics</a> to send data to Google.
		These are just examples that have been discovered so far.
		The lack of freedom impedes independent inspection and secret spy features only become known by accident.
		</p>

		<p>
		Most smart-phones require you to connect and identify yourself to a centralized server before you can use them properly.
		Users have to trust the server without knowing what information is stored and how it is processed or related to other data.
		A phone running only Free Software does not require you to provide data to an untrustworthy company
		or pressure you to do so - at least this is very unlikely, as the softwareâ€™s actions would be obvious
		and the community would be able to develop an alternative version.
		The convenience of "value-added" services that are often coupled with such connections can be provided using Free Software as well.
		This keeps you in control of your personal data, your diary remains in your possession.
		You can have the cake and eat it too.
