<p>The following organisations are sister organisations of the FSFE in the
global FSF network. We are working together on Free Software issues, each one with its own cultural background. The FSFs are legally, financially and personally independant from each other, and like every network, the FSF* network is formed of interconnected components.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1985 - Shortly after the <a href="/about/basics/gnuproject.html">GNU
    project</a> the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>
  (FSF) was founded as the first organisation which cared about Free
  Software.</li>
  <li>2001 - The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) was founded as the
  second FSF.</li>
