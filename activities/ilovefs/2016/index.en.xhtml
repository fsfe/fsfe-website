<div class="p-summary">
<p>In the Free Software society we exchange a lot of criticism. We write bug 
reports, tell others how they can improve the software, ask them for new 
features, and generally are not shy about criticising others. There is nothing 
wrong about that. It helps us to constantly improve. But sometimes we forget to 
show the hardworking people behind the software our appreciation. We should not 
underestimate the power of a simple "thank you" to motivate Free Software 
contributors in their important work for society. The 14th of February (a 
Sunday this year) is the ideal day to do that.</p>

<h2>Show your love for Free Software</h2>

<p>Free Software drives a huge number of devices in our everyday life. It ensures 
our freedom, our security, civil rights, and privacy. It enables everyone to 
participate in a fair society. But as with people, everybody has different 
reasons to love Free Software. Let's show this variety to the world!</p>

<p>As the traditional day to show one's appreciation to people, Valentine's Day 
is the perfect opportunity to say <strong>thank you</strong> to the 
contributors of the various Free Software you love: developers, translators, 
designers, testers, or documentation writers, of huge softwares or smaller 
projects. All of them work on the Free Software ecosystem which we can enjoy 
every day.</p>

<h2>Be part of #ilovefs</h2>

<p>It doesn't matter who and where you are and what you do – everyone can 
participate at the "I love Free Software" day in many different ways:</p>
