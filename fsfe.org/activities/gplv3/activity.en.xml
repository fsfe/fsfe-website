      The release of version 3 of the GNU General Public License (GPL) on 29 
      June 2007 marked the end of an eighteen-month public consultation process. 
      During this time, the FSFE worked to raise awareness of the proposed 
      changes to the licence, to help the community participate in the public 
      consultation, and to document the ongoing discussion to make this issue as 
      accessible as possible.
