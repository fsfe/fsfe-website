      <p>
        After four years of waiting and many online conferences
        – probably too many –, the Chaos Communication Camp is
        finally back! Come and camp with us in the 'Bits &amp; Bäume'
        village from 15th to 19th August 2023. The Free Software
        Foundation Europe is part of this year's 'Bits &amp; Bäume' village.

        Together with many different groups, the FSFE is organising the
        'Bits &amp; Bäume' village. This is a space for all CCCamp participants
        to come together, talk about Free Software and sustainability, connect
        with others, or simply visit the FSFE booth. The 'Bits &amp; Bäume'
        village is not just a meeting place but also a space for input sessions
        and listening to new ideas, as it is involved in organising one of
        the five central stages.
