<h1>Candidates for first Fellowship seat on FSFE's General Assembly</h1>

<p>The election process for the first Fellowship seat on
FSFE's General Assembly is underway now and four people have <a href="/news/2009/news-20090301-01.html">put themselves up</a> for election by
all Fellows: Torsten Grote, Jan-Hendrik Peters, Michel Roche, and Björn
Schießle.</p>

<p>In order to allow you to form an opinion about who would best represent your
interests in FSFE's General Assembly, all candidates provided some information
about themselves which you can find on the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/election09">election page</a>.</p>

<p>The time table for the next steps is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Candidates will present information about themselves through their websites
and blogs, which are also aggregated on the <a href="https://planet.fsfe.org">FSFE planet</a>.</li>

<li>All Fellows are invited to get in touch with the candidates to form an
  opinion about them and decide who they are going to vote for.</li>

<li><strong>Voting period</strong> is the entire month of May 2009</li>

<li>Election results will be announced on 1. June 2009</li>
</ul>

<p>This agenda allows the first elected Fellowship representative to take
part in the upcoming 2009 FSFE General Assembly in Miraflores, Spain and
among other things participate in the election of the future Executive
Committee (President, Vice-President, Financial Officer) of the Free
Software Foundation Europe for the 2009-2011 electoral period, as well
as official confirmation and mandating of the future Executive Director
of the organisation.</p>
