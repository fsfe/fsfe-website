<h2 id="Antitrust_concerns">Antitrust concerns</h2>

<h3>UEFI and bugs</h3>
<p>The fundamental problem is that UEFI is a lot of code. And I really do mean a lot of code. Ignoring drivers, the x86 Linux kernel is around 30MB of code. A comparable subset of the UEFI tree is around 35MB. UEFI is of a comparable degree of complexity to the Linux kernel. <i>See</i> <a

<h3>Apple's iBooks Author EULA restrictions invite antitrust concerns</h3>
<p>Forcing users to sell content through the iBookstore, governed by a separate contract with its own terms, might not survive an antitrust challenge in court if it were to come up. <i>See</i> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2012/01/lawyer-ibooks-author-eula-restrictions-could-raise-antitrust-concerns.ars"> article at Ars Technica</a>;</p>

<h3>ACTA Makes Its Way to the EU Parliament</h3>
<p>After the huge online protests against the extremist SOPA and PIPA copyright bills discussed in the United States, the EU Parliament starts working on their global counterpart: ACTA, the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement.

<h3>Kodak declares bankruptcy, presses on with patent suits, digital strategy</h3>
<p>Eastman Kodak, after 120 years in business, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection today. It may not be surprising, given the way today's digital technologies are making photographic film a relic. But Kodak says it has a plan to rebuild, based heavily both on its own patent portfolio and its own digital technologies. <i>See</i> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2012/01/kodak-declares-bankruptcy-presses-on-with-patent-suits-digital-strategy.ars"> article at Ars Technica</a> and <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/01/kodak-files-bankruptcy-protection-1">article at the Economist</a>;</p>

<h3>Paper: Patent Inflation</h3>
<p>Because the PTO will grant nearly any plausible patent, the vast majority of rejected applications that are appealed to the Federal Circuit will concern boundary-pushing inventions that are unpatentable under current law. Occasionally, a particularly patent-friendly panel of Federal Circuit judges will elect to reverse the PTO and grant a patent that the Agency has denied. The Federal Circuit’s decision will create a new, inflationary precedent. <i>See</i> <a href="http://c4sif.org/2012/01/patent-inflation/"> article at The Center for the Study of Innovative Freedom</a> and <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1623929">paper by professor Jonathan Masur</a>;</p>
