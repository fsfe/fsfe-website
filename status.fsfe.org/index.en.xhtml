				<dd class="description">We have
				  deployed a temporary fix that has
				  restored normal mail delivery across
				  all mailing lists while we continue
				  investigating the root cause. All
				  previously delayed emails have now
				  been delivered, and mailing list
				  functionality is expected to operate
				  as usual moving forward.<br />
				  While the mailing lists themselves
				  are now functioning normally, the
				  web interface for moderation is
				  still affected by a separate
				  issue. Our team is actively
				  investigating this and will provide
				  further updates as soon as more
				  information is available.<br />
				  Thank you for your patience and
				  support!</dd>
