    <h1>172 public institutions removed non-free advertisement</h1>

<p newsteaser="yes">One month after the letters for the PDFreaders campaign of FSFE
were sent, 172 public institutions have removed advertisements for proprietary
PDF readers from their websites.</p>

<p>"Several institutions replied stating that they agree with <a
  href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/letter.html">our concerns</a>, and that they will
modify their websites", said campaign manager Matthias Kirschner. Amongst those
are a number of ministries, parliaments, law enforcement agencies, and the
Belgian Prime Minister's chancellery.</p>

<p>Campaigns like this are made possible by a <a
  href="http://www.fsfe.org/contribute/index.en.html">community of
  volunteers</a>, and <a
  href="http://www.fsfe.org/donate/donate.en.html">financial supporters</a>.
FSFE is following-up with the <a href="/campaigns/pdfreaders/buglist.html">
  remaining organisations</a> in order to get the remaining advertisements
removed.</p>
