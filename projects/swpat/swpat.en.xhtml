        <center><h2>Software Patents in Europe</h2></center>
        <p>
	<b>Expected events:</b><br />
	</p>
	<p>
	The European 
	Commission is expected to release some information related to
	the public consultation around June 2001.
	</p>
	<p>
        The European Commission is expected to issue a proposal for a
        new european directive related to software patents
        in May 2001.

        <p>
	<b>Status report:</b><br />
	</p>
	<p>
	In Europe, the <a
	href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/ma1.html">CONVENTION
	ON THE GRANT OF EUROPEAN PATENTS (EUROPEAN PATENT
	CONVENTION)</a> (published in 1973 and revised December, 17th
	1991) explicitly excludes <i>programs for computers</i> from
	the field of patentable inventions (<a
	href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/ar52.html">article
	52.2</a>). This convention is voted by representatives of each
	country and is binding for all of them. Some countries are not
	part of the european union although most of them are. The <a
	href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/"> European Patent
	Office</a> is a private company who is in charge of
	implementing the European Patent Convention, it is <b>not</b>
	a governemental agency.
	</p>

	<p>
	Despite of the exception related to computer programs, the <a
	href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/">European Patent
	Office</a> granted a large number of patents that are de-facto
	software patents. Some of these patents are listed in the
	<a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/vreji/pikta/mupli/index.en.html">
	European Software Patents: Assorted Examples</a>. Each of them
	can be checked at their <a
	href="http://ep.espacenet.com/">original location</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	In June 1997, the <a
	  href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/indprop/patent/558.htm">
	  European Commission decided </a> to reconsider the
	  patentability of programs in a Green Paper named <a
	  href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/indprop/patent/paten.pdf">Promoting
	  innovation through patents</a>. In <a
	  href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/dipl_conf/overview.htm">November
	  2000</a> the European Patent Office proposed a <a href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/dipl_conf/pdf/em00003.pdf">new version</a>
	  of the <a
	  href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/legal/epc/e/ma1.html">European
	  Patent Convention</a> in which the exception related to
	  computer programs was removed. This modification was <a
	  href="http://petition.eurolinux.org/pr/pr8.html">postponed</a>
	  by the representatives of the european countries because the
	  process of evaluating if software patents are desirable is
	  not over (<a href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/news/pressrel/2000_11_29_e.htm"> European Patent Office press release </a>, <a href="http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/dipl_conf/pdf/em00003a.pdf">Act revising the convention on the grant of european patents</a> in which the exception was maintained).
	</p>

        <p>
	When the time comes, government officials will take their
	decision based on the following factors:

	<ul>
	<li>
	  Official directions from their government that are bound
	  by the directives of the European Commission. 
	</li>
	<li>
	  The outcome of the <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/indprop/comp/softpaten.htm">public consultation</a> that was
	  open from October 2000 to December 2000. 
	</li>
	<li>
	  The <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/indprop/comp/studyintro.htm">study</a> conducted by a private company
	  that concludes in favor of software patents (???? 1999). This
	  study was ordered by the European Commission.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Interpretation of the <a
	  href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm0_e.htm">TRIPS</a>
	  treaty.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Their personal belief.
	</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

        <p>
	In order for software patents to become legal in Europe, it is
	enough to remove the exception related to computer programs from
	the European Patent Convention. 
	</p>

        <p>
	To prevent software patents to become legal in Europe, the
	exception related to computer programs must be preserved and
	<a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/stidi/epue52/index.en.html">the
	Art 52 of the European Patent Convention reworded</a>.  In
	addition the European Patent Office must revoke all de-facto
	software patents that were granted.
	</p>

        <p>
	This status report gives you a broad view of the current situation.
	The problem of software patents is complex because it requires
	a strong legal background to be fully understood, involves many
	countries, influences the life of every european citizen and
	the economical activities of every company using or developing
	software. Because of this, people and organizations have to
	elaborate a large set of strategies to prevent software patents
	to become legal. 
	</p>

        <p>
	The most proeminent actor against software patents is the <a
	href="http://www.eurolinux.org/">EuroLinux Alliance</a> who
	deserves all the credit for the decision made by the officials
	during the Diplomatic Conference held in November 2000.
