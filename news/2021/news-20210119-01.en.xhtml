<h1>FSFE is hiring a part-time technical expert</h1>

<p>
  We are looking for a person with a strong technical background to support
  projects with software engineering and expertise. The person will work
  part-time, either in our Berlin office or remotely.
</p>

<h2>About the FSFE</h2>

<p>
  Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to
  control technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our
  lives and it is important that technology empowers rather than
  restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use,
  understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other
  fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free
  Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and
  self-determination. It enhances users' rights by abolishing barriers
  to Free Software adoption, encourages people to use and develop Free
  Software, and provides resources to enable everyone to further
  promote Free Software in Europe.
</p>

<p>
  We are involved in <a href="/activities/">many activities</a> in the
  legal, economic, political and technical areas around Free Software.
  Our work is made possible by a community of volunteers, supporters,
  donors, and staff.

<h2 id="responsibilities">Main responsibilities</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Working closely with project and program coordinators, and supporting them
  with technical evaluations for our work in the areas of policy, legal and
  public awareness.</li>
  <li>Software engineering of existing and new tools that are used inside and
  outside the organisation. For example, the tools offered by the FSFE's <a
  href="https://reuse.software">REUSE initiative</a>.</li>
  <li>Providing technical and practical expertise for Free Software on mobile
  devices, e.g. for the <a href="/activities/android/">Free Your Android</a>
  activity. That may include updating documentation, preparing workshops, or
  offering training to other staff and volunteers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ability to communicate well, and to translate technical topics to other
  experts in policy, legal and public awareness, and vice versa.</li>
  <li>Willingness and ability to get acquainted with new topics within a short
  time.</li>
  <li>Fluency in written and spoken English. Other European languages are
  considered an asset.</li>
  <li>Solid programming knowledge, especially Python.</li>
  <li>Experience with Android and methods to gain as much software freedom as
  possible on mobile devices.</li>
  <li>Understanding of modern software development collaboration and tools like
  Git and CI systems.</li>
  <li>Enthusiasm for the principles of Free Software and its community.</li>
  <li>Knowledge about Free Software licensing is considered an asset.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="attitude">Attitude</h2>

<p>
  We are looking for a reliable, well-organised team player who contributes
  their technical expertise to various topics, in the form of code, research
  and communication. You are able to self-organise your time budget, and work
  effectively and efficiently. Software freedom is not only a tool for you, but
  something you deeply care about.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, you are a great communicator and feel comfortable to look over
  the rim of your tea cup. You are good at learning new things quickly, and
  explaining these to others in verbal and written form is fun for you. On the
  other hand, you are willing and able to familiarise yourself with and
  incrementally improve existing processes and tools.
</p>

<h2 id="details">Working time</h2>

<p>
  The desired working time would be 10 to 20 hours per week. You can either work
  in the Berlin office or remotely. Of course you could combine this job with
  another activity.
</p>

<h2 id="apply">How to apply</h2>

<p>
  To apply, please send a maximum one-page cover letter – including the desired
  hours per week – and a maximum two-page CV (only
  PDFs are accepted) by email to jobs@fsfe.org, with the subject "technical
  expert". Please do not include pictures of yourself in the application.
</p>

<p>
  Your personal data will be deleted 3 months after we have made our decision.
  The closing date for applications is <em>Sunday, 21 February 2021</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Free Software is meant to serve everyone regardless of their age, ability or
  disability, gender identity, sex, race, nationality, religion or sexual
  orientation. Hence, we encourage applications from all backgrounds and promise
  to judge all applications on merit, without reference to any of the
  characteristics listed. To promote diversity and equality in the Free Software
  community, we shall give preference to applicants who identify as part of a
  traditionally marginalised demographic in technology for applications of equal
  strength.
