<blockquote>
  <p>
    “[T]he book [is] actually more than a fairy tale about software, 
    skateboards and pyramid-shaped ice cream with coloured sprinkles. 
    It is a motivation for the first demo and a little bit of civil 
    disobedience.  It is a utopia of possibilities to make the world 
    better with limited means and little money, and an example without 
    moralistic finger-pointing, that control does not make happy.”

    "A rousing tale of self-reliance, community and standing up to 
    bullies, no matter how powerful they may be. Software freedom is 
    human freedom!"

    "Kirschner's book introduces readers young and old to the power and 
    peril of software. It also highlights the accelerating effects of 
    sharing software freely - creating conditions for direct and 
    indirect collaboration which can be a metaphor for the conduct of 
    science.  Behind it all is a backdrop of ethics of knowledge 
    sharing upon which the arc of human history rides."

    "Even as a non-child, I was captivated by the story from the first 
    page to the last. Kudos to the author for packaging difficult 
    topics such as monopolies, lobbyism, digital divide, software 
    freedom, digital autonomy, IoT, consumer control, e-waste and much 
    more in a child-friendly form in an easily understandable and 
    exciting storyline."

    "I am excited about Matthias Kirschner's children's book Ada &amp; 
    Zangemann because it not only fills an important gap of presenting 
    the concept of Free Software to children, but also because it is 
    extremely well done.  Matthias has enlisted the help of children's 
    book professionals to ensure a top-quality product. We'd like to 
    see this book published in English, and will gladly use our market 
    reach to help spread the word once it is available."
