    <h2 id="submission-details">Submission details and background</h2>
    
    <p>This section is here to help you to understand what kinds of projects are eligible to be funded and what kinds of information we are looking for to evaluate our support</p>
    
    <h3>Your contact data</h3>
    <div style="margin-left:2em">
    <p><strong>Your full name:</strong> Write your full name here.</p>
		<p><strong>Your email:</strong>  please provide an email here for us to get in contact. Please note that only @fsfe-email-addresses are eligible for funding. This is because our project funding is available for FSFE community members in particular and not for other community projects. If you are a supporter, contributor or volunteer for the FSFE but you do not yet have an @fsfe-account, please <a href="mailto:contact@fsfe.org">get in contact with us</a> and we shall figure this out.</p>
		<p><strong>Group Name:</strong> this could be an individual name or a generic name like "Local group Brussels". In case you apply for individual support leave this field blank or write "none". </p>
		</div>
    
    <h3>Project Facts</h3>
    <div style="margin-left:2em">
		<p><strong>Please describe your project output(s):</strong> As the name implies, please tell us what is the project about and what will be the deliverables in the end. Please take some time for a description of your project, that enables us to understand it without knowing the context before. Usually this means to give us information about its background, any previous activities or a local context in which it operates. There is neither need to exaggerate nor to write us multiple pages with a detailed project management plan. All we like to read is: WHAT is planned to happen, with which RESOURCES, in what CONTEXT and potential the GOALS you want to achieve. Once we are convinced, we will discuss all other relevant details with you.</p>
		
		<p>The following two examples are to help you understand what is sufficient as a project description:</p>
		
		<p><strong><em>Example 1:</em></strong><br />
        <em>"The local group Brussels is planning a public debate about "Digital Smart Brussels" project between the local governor and our group coordinator, Jane Doe. We are going to invite local FSFE supporters via the FSFE channels and decision-makers from the larger area of Brussels. The room we rent is in the city center, can host 80 people and will cost 220 Euro for rent. We also want to put up an information booth and need up-to-date material for this. As a moderator we like to invite John Doe, who is professor for Digital Transformation at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles and asks for 60 Euro transportation costs.<br />The goal is to spread the word about the potentials of Public Money? Public Code! in the current "Smart City" consultations of the Brussels city government via the public debate. People and decision-makers should be informed about the benefits Free Software to make smart decisions. The second goal is to promote our local group via the information booth, so we potentially attract new members."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong><em>Example 2:</em></strong><br />
        <em>"I want to send 50 I love Free Software letters to my local politicians in Paris. I have created a draft that I can send you on request and need 100 Euro for printing, the letters and stamps. Goal is to give the local government a positive impact on Free Software shortly before they do a consultation round regarding the public procurement of their IT systems."</em></p>
		
		<p><strong>Who will be involved in the project:</strong> Please list the people or groups that will be involved in the project and if you think it is helpful their roles and competencies.</p>
	</div>
	
	 <h3>Project Duration</h3> 
	 <div style="margin-left:2em">
		<p>Please give us a start and an end date of your project. If your project covers a longer period of time, use the dates to give us a rough idea from when to when.</p>
		</div>
    
    
     <h3>Project Budget</h3>
     <div style="margin-left:2em">
		<p><strong> Please list all planned gross external costs:</strong> As the name implies, please list all external costs in a bullet point list. If you end up to needing more money you may submit a follow-up request. If you need less money, everyone is happy. As a tip, do calculate realistically and then add 10% to avoid having to make a follow-up request in case you just exceed your realistic calculations for some expense. </p>
		
		<p>During your project make sure to keep accounting of all your costs. Usually you will get reimbursed afterwards but if necessary we can also help pre-finance your project. In any case we can only fund any expense proven by an invoice.</p>
				
		<p> Taken the examples above this would be:</p>
		
		<p><em><strong>Example 1:</strong><br />
			<ul>
				<li>booking the room A301 in "Green Corner" in "Rue Europeenne 23/b" on June 5 for 2 hours from 20:00 to 22:00: 220 Euro</li>
				<li>Covering transportation costs for Jane Doe, professor for Digital Transformation who is moderating the debate: 60 Euro</li>
				<li>Offer Water and snacks for participants: 60 Euro</li>
			</ul>
			Please also send us package with up-to-date information material from the FSFE for our booth.</em></p>
		<p><strong> Total expected gross external costs:</strong> 375 Euro (including 10% flexibility)</p>
		
		<p><em><strong>Example 2:</strong><br />
			<ul>
				<li>20 Euro for 50 envelopes</li>
				<li>30 Euro for printing 50 ilovefs letters in color</li>
				<li>50 Euro for stamps to send 50 letters.</li>
			</ul>
			Please also send us package with up-to-date information material from the FSFE for our booth.</em></p>
		<p><strong>Total expected gross external costs:</strong> 100 Euro</p>
