	  <h1>FSFE supports Hellwig's GPL compliance lawsuit</h1>

	  <p newsteaser="yes">FSFE welcomes
	    the <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/mar/05/vmware-lawsuit/">action</a>
	    which Christoph Hellwig and the Software Freedom
	    Conservancy are taking to bring VMware into compliance
	    with the GNU General Public License.</p>
	  
	  <blockquote><p>
	    FSFE's president Karsten Gerloff comments: "Free Software
	    is a public resource, and it is governed by legal rules
	    and social norms. Anyone who draws on this resource
	    without respecting those rules and norms does damage to
	    the community at large. The great majority of such
	    problems are successfully resolved through dialogue and
	    goodwill. It is only when dialogue fails that legal steps
	    become necessary in order to protect this resource which
	    we all share.
	  </p></blockquote>
	  <p>
	    While FSFE regrets that this lawsuit has arisen, we
	    believe that safeguarding Free Software against those who
	    try to appropriate for themselves what belongs to us all
	    is of the utmost importance.
	  </p>
