        <title>SFSCON '23 - Windows and Office “tax” refund in Bolzano, Italy</title>

    <body>
      <p>Some manufacturers try to force to use the preinstalled software on the PC you acquire, sometimes also claiming that alternative software will not work properly.</p>
      <p>On 2018 FSFE volunteer Luca Bonissi purchased a Lenovo Tablet/PC that came with Microsoft Windows pre-installed. He requested the refund to Lenovo, but Lenovo denied to refund him. A court case was initiated, and Lenovo was condemned to pay a punitive damages of 20,000 euros for its abusive behaviour.</p>
