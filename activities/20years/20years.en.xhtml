<h1 class="p-name">20 Years FSFE</h1>

<div id="introduction">
	
	<p><em>
		The Free Software Foundation Europe turns 20. This means two 
		decades of empowering users to control technology. Two decades of 
		helping individuals and organisations to understand how Free  Software 
		contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination.
	</em></p>

	<p><em>
		We would like to take a breath and look back on the road we have 
		come, to reflect the milestones we have passed, the successes we have 
		achieved, the stories we have written and the moments that brought us 
		together and which we will always joyfully remember.
	</em></p>

	<p><em>
		But it is not just about the FSFE itself: for our 20th birthday 
		we want to give momentum to our pan-European community, the community 
		that has formed and always will form the shoulders that our movement 
		relies on. 20 Years FSFE is meant to be a celebration of everyone who 
		has accompanied us in the past or still does. Thank you for 
		contributing your piece of the puzzle that shapes the FSFE and setting 
		the foundation for the next decades&#39; work of the movement for 
		software freedom.

birthday message from our President Matthias Kirschner</h3>
  
	<p>
		Although technology is ever-changing, our values have been 
		consistent throughout the last twenty years. The core of our work 
		is, in a nutshell: educating people on the nature of Free Software, 
		highlighting its political implications, and simplifying its legal 
		preconditions. Matthias Kirschner, President of the FSFE since 
		2015, explains this in his own words in a short video.

and interviews</h2>

	<p>
		We contacted people who paved the way of the FSFE since its 
		beginning, such as long term volunteers and past staffers. In a series 
		of interviews we discuss the progress of the FSFE as well as 
		technological topics.

	<p>
		So many things have happened in the last 20 years! Countless of hours 
		that members of our community have spent running booths, giving talks, 
		holding workshops, organise meetings, do lobbying and more. 
		Unfortunately we miss a lot of visuals from these activities! We would 
		love to fill up our archive with all the great things you were doing in 
		support of our cause!
	</p>

	<p>
		So if you have a video, a picture, or anything else that represents 
		your time with the FSFE and that you like to share, please send it 
		to contact (at) fsfe (dot) org together with a short description what is to 
		see on the visual and a license we can use to re-publish it.
	</p>

<h4><strong>Create a birthday video</strong></h4>
	<p>
		Would you like to send us your personal birthday wishes and show your 
		affiliation with the FSFE? Take a camera and record a one or two minute 
		video of you sending your birthday wishes, maybe together with some 
		commemorations of your time with the FSFE and then please send your 
		video to contact (at) fsfe (dot) org together with a license we can use 
		to re-publish it and it possibly might end up here.
