00:00:30,000 --&gt; 00:00:36,880
Welcome to the software freedom podcast.

7
00:00:36,880 --&gt; 00:00:40,760
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

8
00:00:40,760 --&gt; 00:00:45,640
We are a charity that empowers users to take control of technology.

9
00:00:45,640 --&gt; 00:00:50,040
I'm Bonnie Mehring and our guest for this episode is Alexander Sandar.

10
00:00:50,040 --&gt; 00:00:56,880
Alex is a colleague of mine and he's also the senior policy consultant for the FSFE.

11
00:00:56,880 --&gt; 00:01:02,360
In his work for the FSFE, he monitors the current happenings in the EU and pushes for

12
00:01:02,360 --&gt; 00:01:05,960
recognition of free software there.

13
00:01:05,960 --&gt; 00:01:11,880
Today we will talk a bit about funding of free software and especially the case of the

14
00:01:11,880 --&gt; 00:01:17,920
NLNet foundation and thereby the funding of the next generation internet.

15
00:01:17,920 --&gt; 00:01:24,320
Through the next generation internet program, free software projects are funded by public

16
00:01:24,320 --&gt; 00:01:25,320
money.

17
00:01:25,320 --&gt; 00:01:30,280
But this funding was actually cut by 27 million euros.

18
00:01:30,280 --&gt; 00:01:35,960
When this news reached the FSFE and Alex, we decided to take action.

19
00:01:35,960 --&gt; 00:01:41,880
About this and the latest developments, I will talk more with Alex in the next few minutes.

20
00:01:41,880 --&gt; 00:01:43,200
So thank you very much Alex.

21
00:01:43,200 --&gt; 00:01:48,040
I'm very, very happy to have you here at the software freedom podcast, especially since

22
00:01:48,040 --&gt; 00:01:49,240
we do a lot together.

23
00:01:49,240 --&gt; 00:01:56,720
So we do the EU packing for freedom competition for young teenagers, we occasionally work

24
00:01:56,720 --&gt; 00:02:02,400
together on public money, public code and now we also do the software freedom podcast

25
00:02:02,400 --&gt; 00:02:03,400
together.

26
00:02:03,400 --&gt; 00:02:07,520
Thank you so much for making this possible and for finding the time to talk to me.

27
00:02:07,520 --&gt; 00:02:08,520
Yeah.

28
00:02:08,520 --&gt; 00:02:09,520
Thanks for having me, Bonnie.

29
00:02:09,520 --&gt; 00:02:14,320
And I'm also looking forward to talk to you and our community about this very important

30
00:02:14,320 --&gt; 00:02:15,520
issue in the next minutes.

31
00:02:15,520 --&gt; 00:02:18,480
Look really looking forward.

32
00:02:18,480 --&gt; 00:02:24,360
So just to give everybody a quick interaction, could you tell us a bit more of what an

33
00:02:24,360 --&gt; 00:02:30,640
Lnet is and what the next generation internet program is and what actually happened there?

34
00:02:30,640 --&gt; 00:02:34,560
How did this cut of 27 million happen?

35
00:02:34,560 --&gt; 00:02:35,560
Yeah.

36
00:02:35,560 --&gt; 00:02:36,560
I will try.

37
00:02:36,560 --&gt; 00:02:44,400
A lot of questions and it's also a bit complex with all the words, but I'll give it a try.

38
00:02:44,400 --&gt; 00:02:49,600
So first of all, you already said the next generation internet program.

39
00:02:49,600 --&gt; 00:02:57,800
So this is basically a front which helps you come up with solutions that help people

40
00:02:57,800 --&gt; 00:03:04,160
in the internet and here with a specific focus on free software, right?

41
00:03:04,160 --&gt; 00:03:09,680
So because we know free software visits for freedoms to use, study, share and improve

42
00:03:09,680 --&gt; 00:03:14,960
definitely helps to gain control over the technology you are using.

43
00:03:14,960 --&gt; 00:03:22,960
And that is acknowledged in this fund and thus this fund provides financial support to projects

44
00:03:22,960 --&gt; 00:03:28,600
like Jitsi, Kripport, F1, PeerTube and other projects you might know.

45
00:03:28,600 --&gt; 00:03:33,840
And here you can already see the money is not going to big tech, but rather to community

46
00:03:33,840 --&gt; 00:03:39,160
projects, to small project, individual projects, projects by foundations.

47
00:03:39,160 --&gt; 00:03:45,000
So it's about basically the core infrastructure that we are using every day when we are

48
00:03:45,000 --&gt; 00:03:48,080
going in the internet.

49
00:03:48,080 --&gt; 00:03:53,440
So it's more small projects that are funded by the NGI.

50
00:03:53,440 --&gt; 00:03:59,800
So the NGI project basically funds up to around 500 projects, right?

51
00:03:59,800 --&gt; 00:04:06,960
So there are many projects around all of them pretty like on the size of Jitsi, Kripport,

52
00:04:06,960 --&gt; 00:04:08,520
have tried stuff like this, right?

53
00:04:08,520 --&gt; 00:04:12,480
So but you won't find any gurus or Microsoft's in this fund.

54
00:04:12,480 --&gt; 00:04:14,480
All right.

55
00:04:14,480 --&gt; 00:04:22,520
And also the next generation internet is part of a bigger program, namely the Horizon Europe

56
00:04:22,520 --&gt; 00:04:23,520
program.

57
00:04:23,520 --&gt; 00:04:29,760
The Horizon Europe program is a research, the framework research program of the European Union

58
00:04:29,760 --&gt; 00:04:35,480
and their money is distributed as a name says, obviously, into research projects.

59
00:04:35,480 --&gt; 00:04:41,920
So here you can normally find pilot projects, one time projects, maybe sometimes project

60
00:04:41,920 --&gt; 00:04:45,440
that go for a second term, a second one.

61
00:04:45,440 --&gt; 00:04:49,440
But normally it's like a one project thing, then you have done your research, you found

62
00:04:49,440 --&gt; 00:04:51,800
your results, and then you continue.

63
00:04:51,800 --&gt; 00:04:58,040
So you see it's slightly different than what you have in mind when you were thinking

64
00:04:58,040 --&gt; 00:05:02,080
about like investing in encryption of Jitsi, for example.

65
00:05:02,080 --&gt; 00:05:10,160
So that's also some kind of research, definitely, but it's rather investing in our core infrastructure.

66
00:05:10,160 --&gt; 00:05:19,000
So you can already see that there is a slight issue with the frame of this funding.

67
00:05:19,000 --&gt; 00:05:22,320
But however in the last years, it worked out perfectly.

68
00:05:22,320 --&gt; 00:05:30,960
So in this next generation internet program, the Net Foundation, a foundation from the Netherlands,

69
00:05:30,960 --&gt; 00:05:35,560
they were distributing the funds to these tiny free software project that helped to improve

70
00:05:35,560 --&gt; 00:05:36,560
their code.

71
00:05:36,560 --&gt; 00:05:41,400
And by thus, we had way better tools than out there than before.

72
00:05:41,400 --&gt; 00:05:45,200
And this should have continued until 2027, basically.

73
00:05:45,200 --&gt; 00:05:47,880
And for this, there are work programs.

74
00:05:47,880 --&gt; 00:05:52,600
So for every two years, the European Commission, together with the member states of the European

75
00:05:52,600 --&gt; 00:05:58,440
Union, write on a work program to come up with a sketch, basically, to say what should

76
00:05:58,440 --&gt; 00:06:02,560
happen, where should the money go roughly in the next two years?

77
00:06:02,560 --&gt; 00:06:06,640
So in this work program, that was exactly, yeah.

78
00:06:06,640 --&gt; 00:06:11,640
And that work program that was released during the summer break.

79
00:06:11,640 --&gt; 00:06:19,120
And when I say released, it was publicly released, but it was basically released towards

80
00:06:19,120 --&gt; 00:06:24,160
the member state with the European Union, but it was not released to the public.

81
00:06:24,160 --&gt; 00:06:29,560
In this work program, we have seen that there is a cut of this budget for free software.

82
00:06:29,560 --&gt; 00:06:34,280
27 millions that we expected to be there, haven't been there.

83
00:06:34,280 --&gt; 00:06:36,160
So there was simply nothing.

84
00:06:36,160 --&gt; 00:06:38,640
So we figured this out with a leak.

85
00:06:38,640 --&gt; 00:06:45,320
And then we got active because we have seen during the summer 27 millions that had to

86
00:06:45,320 --&gt; 00:06:51,480
be assigned to free software projects, right to do these Gizzi project script, and so on

87
00:06:51,480 --&gt; 00:06:56,200
and so forth, the examples I mentioned for the next two years, they have been cut.

88
00:06:56,200 --&gt; 00:07:01,440
That was the situation in the summer, and then we started to work.

89
00:07:01,440 --&gt; 00:07:09,160
So this leak reached our ears, and we decided to work, but how did you feel at the moment

90
00:07:09,160 --&gt; 00:07:15,040
when you noticed, oh my god, okay, where are the 27 millions, where have they gone?

91
00:07:15,040 --&gt; 00:07:20,160
Yeah, I'm not sure if I can like publicly say what I really felt, but let's put it like

92
00:07:20,160 --&gt; 00:07:29,600
this, I was pretty upset, yeah, and also I was, to be honest, I didn't expect it, and

93
00:07:29,600 --&gt; 00:07:34,320
I haven't seen it coming because in the beginning of the year, at first, then the

94
00:07:34,320 --&gt; 00:07:39,440
largest free software conference in the world, which is happening in Brussels, always the

95
00:07:39,440 --&gt; 00:07:46,200
first week and in February, there we invited to commission in our death room to talk about

96
00:07:46,200 --&gt; 00:07:52,320
this NGI funding, and there they presented a study where they showcased how important

97
00:07:52,320 --&gt; 00:07:57,120
this NGI funding is, how good this funding is, how well everything works, and how important

98
00:07:57,120 --&gt; 00:08:02,800
this is not only for the tools itself and our consumers, but also for the European Union,

99
00:08:02,800 --&gt; 00:08:09,400
right, so all in the studies, they presented there, showed how important and how good

100
00:08:09,400 --&gt; 00:08:10,400
this funding is.

101
00:08:10,400 --&gt; 00:08:15,080
It was in the beginning of the year, and then during the summer break, there was this

102
00:08:15,080 --&gt; 00:08:20,360
budget cut, so I definitely started to call people, I was asking around what happened,

103
00:08:20,360 --&gt; 00:08:25,200
and then I figured out, wow, they shifted the money towards AI.

104
00:08:25,200 --&gt; 00:08:31,040
So instead of bringing these 27 million euros into free software and build, they decided

105
00:08:31,040 --&gt; 00:08:37,560
they wanted to shift it towards AI, and the argument was pretty much as these funds

106
00:08:37,560 --&gt; 00:08:43,160
are made for research, they want to shift the focus to research since the whole European

107
00:08:43,160 --&gt; 00:08:48,320
Union, basically you know the debate after the AI Act is now shifting towards this password

108
00:08:48,320 --&gt; 00:08:51,120
and all the money should go into AI.

109
00:08:51,120 --&gt; 00:08:56,920
So that's the problem we faced, and that's also what I then quickly figured out and where

110
00:08:56,920 --&gt; 00:09:03,240
we have been a bit upset and see the need to talk.

111
00:09:03,240 --&gt; 00:09:10,840
All right, so they decided to shift the money around and what did we do, what happened

112
00:09:10,840 --&gt; 00:09:11,840
then?

113
00:09:11,840 --&gt; 00:09:18,960
I mean, it was not only us who figured this out, I mean also other communities, also

114
00:09:18,960 --&gt; 00:09:23,680
beneficiaries have figured out that there was an issue, and one of the first reaction

115
00:09:23,680 --&gt; 00:09:30,400
was that in France some free software communities came together with an open letter, and they

116
00:09:30,400 --&gt; 00:09:37,320
addressed the European Commission on this, and they wanted to get the funds back, but it

117
00:09:37,320 --&gt; 00:09:45,040
was pretty much like on this specific 27 million funds, but I figured out that also with

118
00:09:45,040 --&gt; 00:09:50,040
the argument that the Commission came up, that they said, hmm, research, we need to shift

119
00:09:50,040 --&gt; 00:09:58,360
our priorities, I have seen that we have a larger issue here, so I have seen that we need

120
00:09:58,360 --&gt; 00:10:05,800
to move the funds also away from the horizon Europe into something, so away from research

121
00:10:05,800 --&gt; 00:10:10,360
into something which is core funding, which is sustainable, which is something where it's

122
00:10:10,360 --&gt; 00:10:14,560
not simply happening that the Commission is sitting there in a summer break, and they

123
00:10:14,560 --&gt; 00:10:18,920
are, we cut this funding, there should be a possibility to publicly debate this, to

124
00:10:18,920 --&gt; 00:10:25,760
have some more visibility on this, and so that is why we asked our community to also contact

125
00:10:25,760 --&gt; 00:10:33,880
the Commission directly on this, so we called on our community to call pretty much the president

126
00:10:33,880 --&gt; 00:10:39,120
of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and write your emails on that, coming

127
00:10:39,120 --&gt; 00:10:44,600
up with the argument that first of all these 27 millions mean some projects might even

128
00:10:44,600 --&gt; 00:10:49,720
die on the way, right, so we can't improve them, it's also bad, but also that we want

129
00:10:49,720 --&gt; 00:10:56,560
to move the funds away to something core funding, and people did this, so people were reaching

130
00:10:56,560 --&gt; 00:11:02,200
out to the European Commission based on our arguments, letting them all individually

131
00:11:02,200 --&gt; 00:11:07,280
created, so it was not like a standard letter they used, but they reused our arguments,

132
00:11:07,280 --&gt; 00:11:13,200
so we put it in a way that we helped them to cut up this individual letters to the Commission,

133
00:11:13,200 --&gt; 00:11:19,480
and this led to the situation that the Commission also reacted, so in the first place, also

134
00:11:19,480 --&gt; 00:11:24,280
when journalists asked them on this, they didn't have any saying on this, they didn't

135
00:11:24,280 --&gt; 00:11:29,360
wanted to speak publicly about this, but due to the open letter from France and our activity

136
00:11:29,360 --&gt; 00:11:34,720
from the FBI on contacting the Commission directly, there were some movements within

137
00:11:34,720 --&gt; 00:11:39,280
the Commission, and they reacted, and by that we got contact to a head of unit being

138
00:11:39,280 --&gt; 00:11:44,840
in charge of the program, and by that we started basically in dialogue with the European

139
00:11:44,840 --&gt; 00:11:49,920
Commission, and this led to the fact that they at least acknowledged already at this time

140
00:11:49,920 --&gt; 00:11:56,360
that was then August September, and that they at least want to try to make sure that

141
00:11:56,360 --&gt; 00:12:03,480
they will try to sprinkle the money still towards free software projects, even if it's

142
00:12:03,480 --&gt; 00:12:09,120
not in there anymore. However, I mean, this is just a vague statement, rather than nothing

143
00:12:09,120 --&gt; 00:12:15,960
for sure, but it is still vague, as it doesn't give us really a chance to say like, we can

144
00:12:15,960 --&gt; 00:12:23,760
monitor this or how much is this like in euros, for example, so there was not really a

145
00:12:23,760 --&gt; 00:12:29,360
chance for us for oversight, so and by that we continued, and followed up with the reaction,

146
00:12:29,360 --&gt; 00:12:34,480
yeah, try to stay in touch with the European Commission, but also in the meantime we went

147
00:12:34,480 --&gt; 00:12:40,760
to the European Parliament, and try to find members of the Parliament that will come up with

148
00:12:40,760 --&gt; 00:12:47,840
amendments in this direction to change the text of this funding so that we can get the

149
00:12:47,840 --&gt; 00:12:55,120
money back and that they basically asked the Commission to reintroduce these 27 million,

150
00:12:55,120 --&gt; 00:12:59,720
so and the European Parliament did, so there have been members and the Parliament who came

151
00:12:59,720 --&gt; 00:13:06,320
up with these amendments, unfortunately they didn't found a majority since the Conservatives

152
00:13:06,320 --&gt; 00:13:12,880
didn't want to earmark the money, but they said, so they didn't want to give it precisely

153
00:13:12,880 --&gt; 00:13:18,640
to free and Open Source software or free software, but they rather want to say we want to invest

154
00:13:18,640 --&gt; 00:13:25,040
in digital, so to say, so that's why this amendment didn't found a majority, but still

155
00:13:25,040 --&gt; 00:13:30,000
right, political costs were rising, people were talking about this, the debate was happening,

156
00:13:30,720 --&gt; 00:13:37,040
and all of the sudden there was then also the consultation on the digital euro program,

157
00:13:37,040 --&gt; 00:13:46,880
so another program to add to the complexity, right, and the digital euro program is a program

158
00:13:46,880 --&gt; 00:13:52,720
which was introduced in light of the corona crisis, in order to move funds into the digital

159
00:13:52,720 --&gt; 00:13:58,560
solutions we needed during the corona crisis, but also in the aftermath, as people understood,

160
00:13:58,560 --&gt; 00:14:05,360
we need to invest in our own technology, in our own tools, and this is a good idea to do this

161
00:14:05,440 --&gt; 00:14:16,480
free software, and let me quickly cut in there, there are a lot of programs around now just to give

162
00:14:16,480 --&gt; 00:14:23,920
this wrap up and some overview, so we have the horizon Europe that is actually intended for research

163
00:14:23,920 --&gt; 00:14:33,600
where the NLNet foundation and the next generation internet program are situated at, so this was

164
00:14:33,600 --&gt; 00:14:38,320
the funding that was going to free software project, and this was the funding that was shifted

165
00:14:38,320 --&gt; 00:14:45,920
then to AI during the summer break, and then we have the digital euro program which is

166
00:14:45,920 --&gt; 00:14:53,760
absolutely independent of the horizon Europe, correct? Exactly, and this was introduced

167
00:14:53,760 --&gt; 00:15:00,640
during corona, so what was the focus of the digital euro program? It doesn't matter so much to be

168
00:15:00,640 --&gt; 00:15:07,440
honest, it only matters that the digital euro program runs until 2027, which means, and there will

169
00:15:07,440 --&gt; 00:15:14,640
be a reform or like a renewal of the digital euro program very, very soon, it will happen

170
00:15:15,440 --&gt; 00:15:21,600
obviously until 2027, so that from 2028 onwards, we have a new digital euro program,

171
00:15:22,240 --&gt; 00:15:28,160
and digital euro as said was basically in the first place introduced to fix corona,

172
00:15:28,880 --&gt; 00:15:37,040
one could say this is done, so now we need to look forward and see how can we prevent a situation

173
00:15:37,040 --&gt; 00:15:42,640
happening again like corona, and there we say we need to invest in the core infrastructure,

174
00:15:42,640 --&gt; 00:15:48,720
and that's why we do believe that the digital, the next digital euro program, which needs to be

175
00:15:48,720 --&gt; 00:15:55,280
set up, which needs to be discussed in the next two years, this should be the new space for

176
00:15:55,280 --&gt; 00:16:02,400
this core funding, and there we also need some new criteria, and we also need some

177
00:16:04,320 --&gt; 00:16:10,720
some more oversight other than that we have seen in the horizon Europe and in the NGI program,

178
00:16:10,720 --&gt; 00:16:16,480
so basically what we want to do or what we are asking to commission is to come up with a sustainable

179
00:16:16,480 --&gt; 00:16:23,840
long-term funding for free software, which should not only focus on research, and therefore we had

180
00:16:23,920 --&gt; 00:16:28,960
the idea to move it to the digital euro program. However, I'm also fine if they come up with a

181
00:16:29,600 --&gt; 00:16:34,560
own completely new budget, but since it is very difficult to come up with completely new

182
00:16:34,560 --&gt; 00:16:40,560
things, it's better to shift things into existing ones, and that's why we are asking for a reform

183
00:16:40,560 --&gt; 00:16:47,920
of the digital euro program, and part of this reform should be that we introduce a sustainable

184
00:16:47,920 --&gt; 00:16:57,120
long-term fund with dedicated oversight and overview for SMEs in Europe, for micro-ender prices,

185
00:16:57,120 --&gt; 00:17:05,360
for communities, for charities, and individual developers for foundations might so, for all these

186
00:17:05,360 --&gt; 00:17:12,480
projects that have been financed in the NGI before to move this into the digital euro program,

187
00:17:12,560 --&gt; 00:17:19,040
but it's better oversight. What did we do then, like how did we take action basically?

188
00:17:19,600 --&gt; 00:17:27,440
Yeah, and for this, the European Commission from time to time runs public consultations,

189
00:17:28,000 --&gt; 00:17:33,600
so whenever they evaluate or whenever they come up with something new, they ask the public on their

190
00:17:33,600 --&gt; 00:17:40,000
takes, and here also just slightly after the summer break, the European Commission opened a

191
00:17:40,000 --&gt; 00:17:46,800
consultation on the digital euro program, and there we took part in this consultation, and there

192
00:17:46,800 --&gt; 00:17:51,920
we asked for this sustainable long-term fund. We said this fund need to be open to individual

193
00:17:51,920 --&gt; 00:17:58,400
developers for communities, as I just said, and basically all of these demands are just

194
00:17:59,680 --&gt; 00:18:06,240
outline. Basically, these kinds of demands we moved into this consultation and asked the

195
00:18:06,240 --&gt; 00:18:13,120
Commission to act accordingly, and also we asked our community to do the same, so we published

196
00:18:13,120 --&gt; 00:18:20,320
our answers to this consultation, we were outlining what we see, how our arguments

197
00:18:21,680 --&gt; 00:18:27,600
could be reused, and we basically asked our community to take part in this consultation,

198
00:18:27,600 --&gt; 00:18:32,080
and to follow these arguments and to basically ask for this sustainable long-term funding,

199
00:18:33,040 --&gt; 00:18:42,080
and normally these consultations attract some experts, some lobbyists, maybe from time to time,

200
00:18:44,160 --&gt; 00:18:49,920
individuals, but normally only a few people take part, but after the consultation was closed,

201
00:18:49,920 --&gt; 00:18:56,480
we have seen nearly 800 people took part in this consultation. This is completely outstanding.

202
00:18:57,280 --&gt; 00:19:04,240
To give you some context, maybe just a few weeks ago, there was a consultation on AI and the

203
00:19:04,240 --&gt; 00:19:10,320
European Commission released the press release that 400 people took part, and this is really outstanding,

204
00:19:10,960 --&gt; 00:19:17,040
and I can tell you there was no press release on this consultation where 800, or nearly 800 people

205
00:19:17,040 --&gt; 00:19:24,160
took part, but you can see, right, so we really managed it to shed a lot of light on this consultation,

206
00:19:24,160 --&gt; 00:19:30,800
many people took part, and just of today, as we are talking, and so basically today is the

207
00:19:30,800 --&gt; 00:19:38,320
13th of November, the results have been published of the consultation, and it is pretty clear

208
00:19:39,920 --&gt; 00:19:45,520
that people were following basically our call and asked for this sustainable long-term funding,

209
00:19:45,520 --&gt; 00:19:51,760
and what is even more important, they did this on an individual basis, not by copy and paste,

210
00:19:51,760 --&gt; 00:19:59,520
what we did, but they came up with their own words, and this underlines not only the knowledge

211
00:19:59,520 --&gt; 00:20:06,400
in our community, and also the, yeah, basically the courage to take part in such a consultation,

212
00:20:06,400 --&gt; 00:20:11,200
which is not very common, and also to come up with their own words, since they see the problem,

213
00:20:11,200 --&gt; 00:20:17,680
and then they can describe the problem pretty well in their own words. We have a very, very good

214
00:20:17,760 --&gt; 00:20:24,400
answer to the consultation now, and the commission released a report where they clearly said that

215
00:20:24,400 --&gt; 00:20:30,560
this is a calling demand from people taking part in this consultation. They also see that,

216
00:20:31,760 --&gt; 00:20:37,600
and they also write it, that we, yeah, did the call on this, and they refer to our

217
00:20:38,320 --&gt; 00:20:45,920
block posts, news items, where we were writing about it, but also other than that, it clearly shows

218
00:20:46,000 --&gt; 00:20:50,400
that people gave individual answers that they took a lot of time and efforts to take part in this

219
00:20:50,400 --&gt; 00:20:55,360
consultation, to tell the combination, we want this sustainable long-term fund, and I think that's

220
00:20:55,360 --&gt; 00:21:00,240
already a success in itself, so I want to use this opportunity here to thank everyone who took

221
00:21:00,240 --&gt; 00:21:04,880
part in this consultation. This is super, super helpful, because with this, we can create a lot

222
00:21:04,880 --&gt; 00:21:09,600
of pressure towards the commission, but also do you remember states to really come up with such a fund?

223
00:21:10,560 --&gt; 00:21:16,960
This is a short break for our own cause. Thank you for listening to the Software Freedom podcast.

224
00:21:16,960 --&gt; 00:21:23,280
Working for Software Freedom and producing podcasts costs money. Please consider supporting us

225
00:21:23,280 --&gt; 00:21:28,240
with a donation on the fsfe.org/donate and then the show notes.

226
00:21:30,880 --&gt; 00:21:35,840
So this is now being discussed, or what are the next steps here?

227
00:21:36,480 --&gt; 00:21:41,520
Yeah, I mean, I've definitely, and I also would like to say thank you to everybody who participated.

228
00:21:42,720 --&gt; 00:21:46,320
This is like, I'm sorry, I just quickly passed over it as he,

229
00:21:48,640 --&gt; 00:21:56,160
no, but it is truly remarkable, and it is amazing that people actually care about free software

230
00:21:56,160 --&gt; 00:22:00,880
that much that they sit down, write their arguments down, and think about it, so I'm,

231
00:22:01,840 --&gt; 00:22:05,440
I also find this very touching that it's not something that people

232
00:22:06,960 --&gt; 00:22:14,400
take lightly, but they want to support. Indeed. And it definitely helps in the political process.

233
00:22:14,400 --&gt; 00:22:22,560
So it helps us to create pressure to always bring up this argument, since we can always say,

234
00:22:22,560 --&gt; 00:22:29,360
look back in this consultation, there was a clear demand by the public to do this. And also,

235
00:22:29,360 --&gt; 00:22:36,000
you have acknowledged this in your own analysis afterwards. So I mean, what's happening now is

236
00:22:36,000 --&gt; 00:22:42,400
in the second, probably nothing other than we analyze this, we discuss this, and it's definitely

237
00:22:42,400 --&gt; 00:22:48,080
a long-term game, right? So it's not an activity. You can a bit compare it to our public money,

238
00:22:48,080 --&gt; 00:22:52,640
public code campaign, right? So where we asked public administrations to invest

239
00:22:53,440 --&gt; 00:23:00,080
into free software, rather than proprietary software, when they do procurement processes.

240
00:23:00,080 --&gt; 00:23:06,560
Also, this is a long-term game, which goes step-by-step where we see progress, not every day,

241
00:23:06,560 --&gt; 00:23:10,640
but we see progress, right? And also in the last years, we have seen progress, and that's

242
00:23:10,640 --&gt; 00:23:14,640
the same as the funding. So it won't be that we get from one day to another,

243
00:23:15,440 --&gt; 00:23:23,440
is we billions of euros to invest in our core infrastructure, but it will rather be a step-by-step

244
00:23:23,440 --&gt; 00:23:31,120
thing. And for these steps, this consultation helps, and the consultation is definitely a major step.

245
00:23:31,680 --&gt; 00:23:39,040
In this, since we can directly go to the commission, we can directly demand from them. Also,

246
00:23:39,040 --&gt; 00:23:45,440
members of the European Parliament can table with questions of this, thereby the reports about it,

247
00:23:45,440 --&gt; 00:23:51,440
media, and by that, we publicly need to discuss, right? So we need to rise the political costs,

248
00:23:51,440 --&gt; 00:23:58,000
so to say, so that this is a really a topic that they need to take care of. And this worked out,

249
00:23:58,000 --&gt; 00:24:03,840
and this will continue to work out if we continue to work that closely together with our community.

250
00:24:03,840 --&gt; 00:24:11,520
I'm really looking forward to this. There will be a few more moments in the next months and years

251
00:24:11,520 --&gt; 00:24:17,600
where we will definitely reach out to us, to our community, again, to help us here, since this

252
00:24:17,600 --&gt; 00:24:26,960
public pressure really, really helps. And in particular, in the European Union, you can debate

253
00:24:26,960 --&gt; 00:24:32,560
with the people you can discuss. There are no, we set majorities, they are flexible, you can fight

254
00:24:32,640 --&gt; 00:24:39,200
for majorities, and the more we bring in these good arguments, but also showcase that it's not only

255
00:24:39,200 --&gt; 00:24:46,960
FSFE, FSFE arguments, but these are arguments for the European Union, right? The more likely it is

256
00:24:46,960 --&gt; 00:24:56,000
that we get sufficient funds that are so heavily needed. So just to give also some context here,

257
00:24:56,880 --&gt; 00:25:07,120
I heard at some point that the European Union and the parliament and all the institutions,

258
00:25:07,120 --&gt; 00:25:12,640
this is a very democratic process, actually, so that people can interact and can

259
00:25:14,640 --&gt; 00:25:20,080
also make their voices hear it. What would you say to this? So is this something that is happening

260
00:25:20,160 --&gt; 00:25:26,800
here as well? It definitely helps. I mean, we are not the ones who can automatically vote,

261
00:25:27,680 --&gt; 00:25:33,600
but we are the ones who can create pressures on these votes, and we can shed light on these votes.

262
00:25:33,600 --&gt; 00:25:39,520
And for my experience, I can tell you the more light on that debate is and the more

263
00:25:40,560 --&gt; 00:25:48,720
a topic is publicly debated, the more likely it is that also decision makers that do not really

264
00:25:48,720 --&gt; 00:25:54,720
work in this space, listen to the argument and make up their own mind. And this is what I mean with

265
00:25:54,720 --&gt; 00:26:00,480
fighting for a majority. So there is nothing like what we know, an example from the member states,

266
00:26:00,480 --&gt; 00:26:07,760
right? So that you have basically governments deciding also more or less what to do next,

267
00:26:07,760 --&gt; 00:26:13,280
since they have their maturity. In the European parliament, there is no such clear maturity.

268
00:26:13,280 --&gt; 00:26:20,800
It's moving in every vote. And by thus, you can fight for such a majority to introduce such funds.

269
00:26:20,800 --&gt; 00:26:29,600
So it definitely helps if they see citizens care because they are their voters. And also other

270
00:26:29,600 --&gt; 00:26:38,560
than that, we also have seen that there are many other entities, basically, also the market

271
00:26:38,560 --&gt; 00:26:45,680
is asking for such a fund. So it would not only help citizens or consumer. It will also help

272
00:26:45,680 --&gt; 00:26:51,840
the European market and also European administrations and governments to come up with tools

273
00:26:52,880 --&gt; 00:26:58,080
where they have control over their technology. And as said, we are discussing digital solidarity.

274
00:26:58,720 --&gt; 00:27:04,160
And I really do believe that digital solidarity is not achievable without free software. So if

275
00:27:04,320 --&gt; 00:27:09,520
you don't have the four freedoms to you study, share and improve for your software,

276
00:27:10,240 --&gt; 00:27:15,440
you won't have digital sovereignty. And if you can make this point, and this is also on point,

277
00:27:15,440 --&gt; 00:27:20,800
an documentary race in the consultation and connected even better, the better people understand.

278
00:27:20,800 --&gt; 00:27:28,560
And from the last years and last debates, I can tell you the knowledge around free software

279
00:27:28,560 --&gt; 00:27:34,320
is rising every day in the European Union. And these debates also help to rise this

280
00:27:34,960 --&gt; 00:27:41,280
common level of understanding around free software. And that's also in itself very, very good.

281
00:27:41,280 --&gt; 00:27:47,680
So we have a public debate. We can bring out our arguments. They are understood. Also we have

282
00:27:48,240 --&gt; 00:27:54,400
from the Commission a study saying that these funds are needed. And also we have a new

283
00:27:54,400 --&gt; 00:28:00,320
empowerment already some allies and tabling amendments in this direction. So it is a bit like

284
00:28:02,320 --&gt; 00:28:09,440
an encrowing thing. So I wouldn't say we have this majority today. But since we started in summer,

285
00:28:09,440 --&gt; 00:28:14,720
where there was basically nothing, what we achieved in the last months, I have to say this is

286
00:28:14,720 --&gt; 00:28:20,640
really, really impressive. And this is only doable thanks to the help of our community. So without

287
00:28:20,720 --&gt; 00:28:28,880
the participation of our community, we couldn't debate with this. So we couldn't be so confident in

288
00:28:28,880 --&gt; 00:28:34,160
all debates. How we are today and this definitely helps us to give us power in the debate,

289
00:28:34,160 --&gt; 00:28:41,200
to give us status in the debate. All right. Thank you so much for the update. And yeah,

290
00:28:41,200 --&gt; 00:28:48,560
taking us through this whole process and talking to me about what has happened, what will happen,

291
00:28:48,560 --&gt; 00:28:56,560
or what might happen in the future. And yeah, I'm really looking forward to hear more news about this

292
00:28:56,560 --&gt; 00:29:02,960
in the coming months. Maybe. But before we close, if you want to stay updated on this,

293
00:29:02,960 --&gt; 00:29:07,920
feel free to join our mailing lists, but also sign our public money public code campaign.

294
00:29:07,920 --&gt; 00:29:15,120
By last, you will also get updates and you will be around those if you like. If you click the

295
00:29:15,120 --&gt; 00:29:20,880
tick box that gets emails and information about it, when we are running such campaigns and when

296
00:29:20,880 --&gt; 00:29:27,200
we are asking our volunteers to step in and also port us here to help us. Because as said, there

297
00:29:27,200 --&gt; 00:29:33,120
will be more of these moments, there might be more consultations, there might be more moments when

298
00:29:33,120 --&gt; 00:29:38,880
we need to call the you can parliament to vote in a specific direction. And where we asked our

299
00:29:38,880 --&gt; 00:29:43,920
community to help us with a mail or a phone call or whatever. So and if you want to be around those

300
00:29:43,920 --&gt; 00:29:50,560
that get emails and get information on this, how you can help us please sign up at our mailing list,

301
00:29:50,560 --&gt; 00:29:55,600
go to fsfe.org, sign up for the newsletter and then you will be informed about this. I think

302
00:29:55,600 --&gt; 00:30:00,960
this will be super helpful if you want to join the activities. And as said, it's a long term game,

303
00:30:00,960 --&gt; 00:30:05,440
so there will be definitely more news on this and then not only in the next months, but I guess

304
00:30:05,920 --&gt; 00:30:18,720
three years. Also linked in the show notes, the newsletter. Yes. So with this, I would say thank you

305
00:30:18,720 --&gt; 00:30:24,080
very much, Alex. Thank you very much for taking us through this process. And yeah, as always,

306
00:30:24,080 --&gt; 00:30:30,880
it was a pleasure to have you here. Thanks for having me. It was fun. I hope it's not too much,

307
00:30:31,200 --&gt; 00:30:39,280
not too complex and still interesting. This is true. And also I think it's a very complex topic.

308
00:30:39,280 --&gt; 00:30:46,800
So I think this really helps to understand and to go through this process again and to understand

309
00:30:46,800 --&gt; 00:30:54,880
all the interactings and after different programs actually there. So it was a pleasure for me as well.

310
00:30:55,840 --&gt; 00:31:00,480
With this, I would say goodbye and thank you very much. Thank you. Bye bye.

That was my question. I wanted to ask you all. I wanted to ask you how can others help to secure

00:31:50,320 --&gt; 00:32:00,320
continuous funding of Free Software. But that was a great idea. I'll see you in the next one.
