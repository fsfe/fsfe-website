      In the current situation we see ourselves unable to collaborate both with
      the FSF and any other organisation in which Richard Stallman has a leading
      position. Instead, we will continue to work with groups and individuals
      who foster diversity and equality in the Free Software movement in order
      to achieve our joint goal of empowering all users to control technology.
