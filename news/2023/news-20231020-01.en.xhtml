<p>In 2023, Software Freedom has been back on stage, while we have boosted 
our activities for the coming generations with our children's book and 
the coding competition for young Europeans. We have also continued to 
bring our demands to lawmakers, helped projects to become REUSE 
compliant and we have shared many great moments with our community.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>40 Years of Software Freedom!</strong> The 40th anniversary of the launch of the 
GNU Project, which marked the beginning of the software 
freedom movement, has led us to look back at all that we have achieved over 
the past four decades, but also at the challenges that lie ahead in the 
years to come.</p>

<p>Since the 1980s, technology has become an increasingly 
important part of our lives: we use devices at home to make our daily 
tasks easier, most of us use a laptop at work, we use technology in our 
leisure time (playing, travelling...). And this year, Artificial 
Intelligence has jumped in in a lot of our debates, as it has become a hot 
topic in the public sphere.</p>

<p>Our movement has become global and broad encompassing 
small local companies, large global corporations, civil society 
organisations and thousands of professionals. We are all working 
towards a world where the <a 
href="/freesoftware/index.html#freedoms">four freedoms</a> are 
guaranteed: users are free 
to use software , to adapt it to their needs, and are able to understand 
it, and to share it. These rights support other fundamental rights such as 
freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and privacy.</p> 

<p>However, just like 40 years ago, we still need trustworthy systems that put the end 
user in control. Recent technological developments show that this 
is more important than ever: in the era of the Artificial Intelligence 
we need remember to put people's rights first. In a 
world that communicates through social media, we need decentralised and 
federated networks that are not controlled by an autocratic individual. 
In a time in which we are surrounded by devices, we need not only to be 
able to use them, but also to understand them and to improve them, 
adapting them to our necessities and needs.</p>

<p>In this scenario, we need to empower new generations. They are the first 
generation, many of whom have had 24/7 access to the internet, connected 
devices and social media networks since birth. As a result, their 
comfort level with technology is quite high. However, in order to build 
a democratic, transparent and trustworthy society that relies more and 
more on our technological developments, our children also need to 
understand, tinker and experiment with technology.</p>

<p>The history of humanity has been written through creativity, diversity and collaboration. 
Tinkering, first with our hands and now additionally with computer technology, has helped us 
to evolve, to learn from our mistakes and from the experience and 
knowledge of others.  Let's give our current and future generations the 
right to do the same. Let's give them the power to shape our 
technology and make it their own. Why show them that there is only vanilla when we 
have endless flavours?</p>

<p>
  Our Software Freedom in Europe 2023 report covers the FSFE's activities from 
  November 2022 to August 2023. We hope it gives you a better 
  understanding of our daily work and that you enjoy reading it!</p>

<h2 id="ada-zangemann"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>Ada &amp; Zangemann: a story that travels the world</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>
	“I loved the book; I found the theme very important and 
	interesting, and the message delighted me (first the 
	resourcefulness of Ada, then the demonstration which unites the 
	whole city, and finally the Parliament which learns from its 
	mistakes). This book is exactly what I want to pass on to my 
	children!”
  </p>
  <cite>Canelle A., 18-year-old student translator in a Parisian high school</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>The illustrated book <a href="/activities/ada-zangemann/index.html">'Ada 
&amp; Zangemann - A Tale of Software, 
Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream'</a> by the FSFE, tells the story of 
the famous inventor Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada 
begins to experiment with hardware and software, and in the process 
realises how crucial it is for her and others to control technology.</p> 

<p>The book is currently available in German and now also <a href="/news/2023/news-20230831-01.html">
in English</a>. However, thanks to many volunteers, Ada &amp; Zangemann is also being translated into other 
languages such as French, Italian, Danish or Valencian. These community 
translations and and other resources can be 
found in the <a 
href="/activities/ada-zangemann/index.html">book's git 
repository</a>.</p> 

<blockquote>
  <p>
  "The youth at the Elizabeth Peabody House enjoyed the reading of 
  Ada &amp; Zangemann. It was a fun and engaging read; vivid illustrations, 
  colors, and details on each page kept them excited for what came next. 
  The youth could relate to Ada, as they are full of great, creative 
  ideas; that they hope to bring to life too" 
  </p>
  <cite>Matthew Caughey, Executive Director, The Elizabeth Peabody House</cite>
</blockquote>  
  
<p>Over the past few months, the story of Ada &amp; Zangemann has also been spread through readings. More 
than 900 people have already attended in one of these events in 
Germany, Italy, Belgium, and the USA.  Started by the author, Matthias 
Kirschner, the readings are currently being carried out by other 
FSFE staff and volunteers! For example, Bonnie Mehring read it at 
CCCamp, Dario Presutti read it in Italy to celebrate the Software Freedom Day 
and the volunteer Isabel Dross-Fromm read it, with the help of her 
child, at FrOSCon.</p>

  </figure>



<p>Ada also went overseas to <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/6brjbMKJMKkQ5f1jktkhaa">LibrePlanet, the 
FSF's annual conference</a>, and we found out that she made it to <a 
href="https://unstructured.studio/blog/a-storytelling-session-about-software-and-ice-cream-in-rural-rajasthan/">
rural Rajasthan</a>, and to a hospital school in the Middle East, where 
impaired children from that region realised a small detail that most 
readers may have missed: <a 
href="https://k7r.eu/importance-of-more-inclusive-illustrations/">Ada 
&amp; Zangemann is also about inclusivity</a>. In the book there is a 
girl with a 3D printed leg. Did you notice 
it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  "I read this book to my 6-year old child who was drawn by the beautiful illustrations and couldn’t 
  wait to hear the story. It’s been the start of a much-needed 
  conversation on out-of-the-box thinking, digital freedom, and 
  contesting power in the age of surveillance." 
  </p>
  <cite>Claire Fernandez, Executive Director, European Digital Rights (EDRi)</cite>

podcasts, to talk about the book and Free Software:</p>

<p>Two years ago the FSFE launched the first round of the <a href="/activities/yh4f/index.html">Youth Hacking 
4 Freedom (YH4F)</a> coding contest. YH4F is an initiative aiming to raise 
awareness for Free Software among the younger generation. The
competition encourages teenagers to tinker and experiment with 
technology. It gives participants the opportunity to discuss and network 
with important people in the field of computer science and Free 
Software. The winners are rewarded with a trip to Brussels and a cash 
prize, which could be an investment for their own project. Have a look 
at Bonnie Mehring’s <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/ibNDS7ojB7eHpenrXS835d%20">talk about the YH4F competition at the 
Augsburger Linux-Infotag 2023</a> (in German).</p> 

<p>After the successful conclusion of the first round in 2022, the FSFE 
organised the second round, which launched at the beginning of this year.</p>

<p><strong>First edition:</strong> The winners of the first edition had 
the chance to spend a joyful time in Brussels, where the awards 
ceremony took place. The weekend was summarised in a <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/wWUP7M5fJg2FcvG2Fv12sN
">short video</a> and this year we have published <a 
href="/tags/tagged-yh4f-project.html">interviews with the 
participants</a> to learn 
more about their backgrounds and the projects they developed.</p>

Over the coming months, we will be publishing interviews with 
the participants about their projects. So <strong>stay tuned</strong>!</p> 

<h2 id="pmpc"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>‘Public Money? Public Code!: simple, right?</h2> 

<p><a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Software made with public money should 
be released as Free Software</a>. Simple and clear, right? Over the past 
few months, we have continued our activities to raise awareness of this 
initiative and to explain why it is important.</p>

  </figure>


<p><strong>Free Software in German municipalities:</strong> In January, we hosted an 
online event on Free Software in Dortmund, Germany, with the 
participation of the local government and more than 160 other community 
representatives. Under the title <a 
href="/news/2022/news-20221215-02.html">"Municipalities need Free 
Software"</a> 
the participants were informed about the developments leading to a 
newly founded OSPO in Dortmund, about "Public Money? Public Code!", 
Free Software as the key to digital sovereignty, and new perspectives 
for municipalities that want to use Free Software. The event, <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230119-01.html">that was 
recorded</a>, was organised in cooperation with Do-FOSS and OK.NRW.</p>
 
<p>As a result of the event, the FSFE invited all participants and others from 
municipal administrations to join our <a 
href="mailto:fs-kommunen@lists.fsfe.org">new mailing list </a>on Free 
Software in German municipalities, which currently has more than 200 
subscribers.</p> 

<p>
<strong>A German “Sovereign Workplace” for public 
administrations:</strong> The current German government is working on a 
sovereign workplace, a Free Software office and collaboration suite for 
the public sector, as one of the projects to fulfil the goals of the 
coalition agreement. However, <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230606-01.html">a closer look at the project 
raises 
questions</a> such as: Where is the source code? Who is responsible for it? 
What happens to the public money involved? We asked the German Federal 
Ministry of the Interior and Community (BMI) <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230920-01.html">and publicly analysed the 
answers</a>, criticising the German state-owned enterprise Dataport for 
open-washing its pseudo-sovereign product dPhoenixSuite.
</p> 

<p>If you are 
interested in this topic, check out Johannes Näder's talk about it at 
FrOSCon: <a

Software for German administrations? Mysteries around 
the Souvereign Workplace”</a> (in German).</p> 

<p>
<strong>Midterm evaluation of the German government: </strong>In 
addition, the FSFE, together with an alliance of civil society, scientific 
institutions and the Free Software industry, published a call to the 
German government to <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230829-01.html">implement a sustainable digital 
policy and to 
provide the necessary funds in the federal budget</a>. We draw a negative 
mid-term balance for the digital policy of the German government and 
demand a change towards Free Software and Public Money? Public 
Code!
</p>

<p>
<strong>PMPC in Italy:</strong> <a href="/news/2022/news-20220531-01.html">Six  Public Money, Public Code! 
events were held in Italy</a>, in six different cities: from the 
extreme north to the extreme south: Trento, Bologna, Caltanissetta, 
Milan, Bolzano, and Empoli. The events were run entirely by volunteers.
</p>

<p><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> In this context, we got an 
article on <a 
href="https://www.ifa.de/fileadmin/Content/docs/foerderungen/CCP_Programm/CCP_DigitalCivilSociety_Access-OpenTech.pdf">Free 
Software to control technology</a> published (pages 
11-12[18-21]) (pdf) in “Access OpenTech" for the CrossCulture Programme 
(CCP) by ifa. You can also listen (in German) to Johannes Näder 
explaining in the <a 
href="https://egovernment-podcast.com/egov139-fsfe-pmpc/">eGovernment-Podcast 
our initiative Public Money? 
Public Code!</a> initiative and why Free Software is important for administrations and 
their digital sovereignty. One episode of our Software Freedom Podcast also covers this topic with 
Petter Joelson, the director of Digidem Lab, discussing <a 
href="/news/podcast/episode-17.html">citizen participation and the 
Decidm tool</a>.</p>

<p>Do not forget to support the Public Money, Public Code! initiative 
by <a href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">signing the Open 
Letter</a>, <a href="/news/2022/news-20220823-01.html">sharing your

<h2 id="eu-policy"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>Liability, Interoperability and Free Software in the EU</h2> 
<p>Political decisions and policies have a major impact on Free Software, 
its ecosystems and its communities. The FSFE has long-standing 
experience of working with policy makers and public bodies in Europe, 
from local administrations to high level decision makers. The FSFE aims 
to strength the rights of Free Software users and developers, and works 
to abolish barriers to the adoption of Free Software.</p> 

<p>In the coming months, we expect the following legislation to be adopted in the EU: <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230824-01.html">Liability Act, AI Act, CRA and 
Interoperability 
Act</a>.</p>

<figure>
     <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/big/278c7c68effc3bb373e271be722e93ee.jpg"
       alt="An illustration about the four freedoms that allows Software Freedom"/>
      </figure>

<p>
<strong><italic>Liability / AI Act</italic></strong>: The EU is debating
the introduction of liability rules for software, including Free 
Software. The relevant proposals are the AI Act, the Product Liability 
	Directive (PLD), and the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). As currently 
	proposed, all of these proposals would harm the Free Software ecosystem 
	and hence society and the economy. Therefore, we first
	proposed changes to the AI Act to safeguard Free Software 
	developers, and also presented a similar position on the proposed 
	liability rules in the CRA and PLD during a hearing in the European 
	Parliament. In light of the CRA, we propose <a href="/news/2023/news-20230719-01.html">a solution that 
	will lead to more security while safeguarding the Free Software 
	ecosystem</a>:
</p> 
   <ol> 
    <li>
    Liability should be shifted to those deploying Free Software instead 
    of those  developing Free Software and
    </li> 
	<li>
	Those who significantly financially benefit from this deployment should 
	make sure the software becomes CE-compliant.
	</li> 
	</ol>

<p>
<strong><italic>Interoperable Europe Act</italic></strong>: With the 
proposed Interoperable Europe Act, the EU aims to 
	create a dedicated legal framework for interoperability that will 
	enhance cross-border digital public services across the Union. 
	During the past year, <a href="/news/2023/news-20230323-02.html">the FSFE has been advocating for a more 
	inclusive governance structure in this legislation</a>, where different 
	stakeholders, including the Free Software community, can be part of 
	the Interoperable Europe Board. A proper monitoring workflow and 
	evaluation process together with a dedicated budget are also part of our 
	demands.
</p> 
	
	<p>The EU Parliament has followed some of our demands by taking a 
	step forward towards a more inclusive board while introducing 
	clearer indicators and statistics to monitor the progress of the 
	Act. On the other hand, the Council is moving in the opposite 
	direction by hindering <a href="/news/2023/news-20230623-01.html">the 
	inclusion of relevant stakeholders in the 
	governance structure</a>. A final agreement between the three EU 
	institutions is expected to be reached by the end of this year, and the 
	FSFE calls on the European Parliament to maintain
	its position and not allow any backsliding.</p>
	
	<p>You can get a deeper understanding of the Interoperable European Act by 
	listening to Lina Ceballos explaining <a href="/news/podcast/episode-21.html">why Free Software should be 
	considered and safeguarded in such EU legislation</a> in an episode of 
	our Software Freedom Podcast.</p>

       </figure>
    
<p></p> 
	<p><strong>EU Declaration of Digital Rights: </strong>Member States, the 
	European Parliament and the Commission have 
	reached a consensus on <a href="/news/2022/news-20221206-01.html">the Declaration of Digital Rights and 
	Principles</a>. Although it is intended to serve as a reference point 
	for Europe's digital transformation, it instead dives into murky 
	waters, causing ambiguity. Its wording is unclear and it overlooks 
	existing good proposals. The EU Parliament's proposal had a clear 
	reference to Free Software as a way to ensure transparency in the 
	use of algorithms and artificial intelligence, as well as the 
	importance of Open Standards. Unfortunately, this wording was not 
	retained during the inter-institutional negotiations, and the 
	final text ended up being rather unclear.</p> 
	
	<p>The FSFE has also been working on the protection of open standards. 
	While Alexander Sander participated as a panellist in the Open 
	Standards and Industrial Use of Open Source workshop, part of the 
	<a 
	href="https://swforum.eu/os-standards">SWForum</a>, a few months 
	ago we responded to <a 
	href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13109-Intellectual-property-new-framework-for-standard-essential-patents/F3434433_en">the 
	EC Intellectual Property Consultation on a new framework for 
	standard-essential patents</a>.</p>

	<p>Furthermore, the FSFE’s co-founder and programmer Bernhard E. Reiter 
	explained <a href="/news/2022/news-20221026-02.html">why Free Software 
	supporters should join the protest against 
	the EU Chat control</a>, that deprives citizens of the privacy of digital 
	correspondence. And related to  AI, this year our volunteer Vincent 
	Lequertier published several interesting articles on 
	<a href="https://vl8r.eu/">ethics, Free Software, and AI</a> in Planet FSFE.</p>


<h2 id="legal"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>Legal Support: helping projects and individuals</h2> 
	
<p>At the Free Software Foundation Europe we help answer licensing questions, provide 
technical support to make licensing easier (among others, with REUSE), 
provide legal education materials on Free Software, such as the videos 
from the Legal Education Day, and organise an annual conference for the 
FSFE's legal network, the Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop 
(LLW). We are also part of several EU-funded projects, helping with 
legal concepts and issues.</p>

<h3 id="reuse"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>REUSE: making licensing easier</h3>

<p>The FSFE's <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE project</a> aims to 
make licensing easy for people and machines alike. It solves one of the 
most common Free Software licensing problems: what kind of licence a 
file is licensed under, and who owns the copyright. REUSE provides 
simple recommendations in three steps to help users, developers, and 
legal professionals.</p> 

<p>In 2023 we release the REUSE tools 1.0 and are currently working on improving our RESUE 3.0 specification. This specification defines a 
standardized method for declaring copyright and licensing for software 
projects. The goal of the specification is to have unambiguous, human- 
and machine-readable copyright and licensing information for each 
individual file in a project. Ideally this information is embedded into 
every file, so that the information is preserved when the file is 
copied and reused by third parties.</p> 

<p>Several projects have adopted REUSE, <a 
href="/news/2022/news-20221219-01.html">being GNU Health one of them</a>. Since then, 
users and re-users of GNU Health have been able to have a clear 
overview of the copyright notices and licence terms thanks to the 
standardised way of displaying them by following the REUSE 
specification.</p>

  alt="Picture explaining how REUSE works" />
  </figure>
 
 
<p>At the end of 2022, and during this present year, we have presented the REUSE 
initiative at diverse conferences throughout Europe, such as SFSCON or 
FOSDEM. Our talk at the Weizenbaum Conference 2022 “Practicing 
Sovereignty – Interventions for Open Digital Futures” <a 
href="https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/media/Publikationen/Weizenbaum_Proceedings/Proceedings_Weizenbaum_Conference_2022.pdf">resulted 
in an 
academic article</a> (page 66-71) (pdf)  explaining how REUSE specifications 
facilitate and improve management policies for the digital commons by 
improving data and metadata communication for individuals, communities, 
governments, and businesses.</p>

<h3 id="LED"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>Legal Education Day 2022</h3> 
<p>The FSFE organised a Legal 
 Education Day as part of the South Tyrol Free Software Conference 
 (SFSCON), which featured talks on legal topics relating to Free 
 Software, as well as a workshop to facilitate a better understanding of 
 these legal framework and compliances. Throughout the day, we explained 
 basic legal concepts such as copyright law, licensing, and their 
 practical applications into Free Software projects with the REUSE 
 specification.</p>

<p><strong>The ZOOOM Project:</strong> Since late 2022, the FSFE has been a 
part of the <a href="https://zooom4u.eu/">ZOOOM Initiative</a>, a project financed 
by the European Commission. The primary goal of ZOOOM is to raise 
awareness among the academic, business, industry, and innovation 
communities of the importance of rights and obligations related to Free 
Software, Open Data, and Open Hardware.</p> 

<p>To accomplish this goal, the ZOOOM Initiative will develop a series 
of reports, white papers, training materials, and web portals to 
promote a solid understanding of licensing requirements and business 
needs aiming to reach the three key groups of actors in innovation 
ecosystems: namely knowledge generators, innovation support 
organisations, and key stakeholders.</p>

<p>As one out of ten organisations comprising the consortium that makes 
up the ZOOOM Initiative, the FSFE is responsible for the promotion of our 
<a href="https://reuse.software">REUSE specification</a> as well as producing 
educational materials on the fundamental legal concepts of Free 
Software and licensing.</p>

  alt="ZOOOM project logo" />
  </figure>

<p>Our work on ZOOOM has been progressing 
well, and we have contributed with chapters to the various papers explaining 
the basics of Free Software, including elementary Free Software legal 
and licensing issues. In particular, we have also compiled a chapter on 
Free Software licensing issues related specifically to Artificial 
Intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>We will keep you updated on when we will publicly 
share these materials as we are currently awaiting their final 
publication, so stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>Next Generation Internet Zero:</strong> Since 2018, the FSFE has 
been involved in the <a href="/activities/ngi/ngi.html">Next Generation 
Internet Zero (NGI0) initiative</a> as a consortium member. Funded by 
the European Commission, the <a 
href="https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ngi-zero/">NGI0 initiative</a> 
hopes to support the 
development of the internet into <a 
href="/news/nl/news/2023/news-20230425-01.html">a platform that is 
accessible and 
diverse, and that respects fundamental rights</a>, including values such as 
privacy, which is also referred to as the Next Generation Internet. At 
the FSFE, we believe that Free Software is key to accomplish this goal, 
so that all users are able to use the internet as an effective tool to 
achieve their full potential.</p>

<p>NGI0 projects provide financial grants and technical support to 
researchers and developers who are working on Free Software solutions 
that contribute to the establishment of the vision of the Next 
Generation Internet.</p>

<p>After completing <a href="/activities/ngi/ngi-past.tml">our previous 
NGI0 projects in 2022</a>, we have for the past year been working on our 
current NGI0 projects: <a href="https://nlnet.nl/entrust">NGI0 
Entrust</a>, <a href="https://nlnet.nl/core">NGI0 Core</a>, and <a 
href="https://nlnet.nl/NGI0/review/">NGI0 Review</a>.</p>
      
<p>As we’ve always done with our previous NGI0 projects, we have been 
assisting the software projects receiving grants from these various 
NGI0 projects with their legal and licensing needs, as well as helping 
them in their transitions when adopting our <a href="https://reuse.software">REUSE specification</a>.</p>
   
<p>We continued our work with NGI0 this year by helping many developers 
working on Free Software solutions solve a diverse range of problems, 
as well as helping them have a better understanding of Free Software 
licenses, compliance issues, and how they can avoid some of these 
pitfalls by adopting our REUSE specification.</p>

<h3 id="llw"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>Legal Network and LLW 23</h3> 

<p>In 2023, the FSFE successfully organised our first Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop (LLW) as 
an in-person event again, after a 3-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 
pandemic.</p>

  alt="Picture showing some material from LLW 2023" />
  </figure>


<p>The LLW is organised every year by the FSFE to allow legal experts 
in the <a href="/activities/ln/ln.html">FSFE’s Legal Network</a> to 
discuss legal issues and best practices surrounding Free Software 
licenses. This event has become one of the foremost gathering  of 
lawyers, technologists, and thought leaders on Free Software legal and 
licensing topics. This event is usually an important opportunity that 
the FSFE provides to the legal community to share knowledge and updates 
on the topics that they are working on, in order to foster a better 
license compliance ecosystem by spreading best practices in the legal 
sphere. Additionally, the LLW provides a forum for legal professionals 
to better understand one another, which reduces overall friction in the 
sector. This year’s LLW was held in April in Gothenburg, Sweden. Over 
the course of three days, our 100 guests discussed software licensing 
issues relating to AI, process issues in license curation at the Open 
Source Initiative (OSI), and updates on legal cases involving Free 
Software licenses.</p>

<p>The last weeks of 2022 also left us some good news! Copyleft-licensed

<h2 id="tedective"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>TEDective: making European public procurement data explorable</h2> 

<p><a href="https://tedective.org/">TEDective</a> is making European public procurement 
data explorable for non-experts. Using open data this Free Software 
program empowers citizens by making EU tendering data accessible to 
anyone who wants to consult and use it. For example, it will allow a 
journalist to find out how much money the government spends on 
Microsoft licenses and products, but also to compare that spending with 
other regions in similar cases or even in comparison with other 
countries.</p>

<p>‘TEDective’ <a href="/news/2022/news-20221026-01.html">won last year the 
first prize</a> in ‘transparency in public procurement’ challenge in the 
EU Datathon.</p>

<p>Developed with the help of our volunteer Michael Weimann, and released as a 
REUSE-compliant project under a Free Software (also known as Open 
Source) license, TEDective improves access to the data published by 
Tenders Electronic Daily (TED), by fulfilling all of the following 
requirements for the provision of TED data: it is available free of 
charge for both commercial and non-commercial use; it is 
up-to-date (updated at least monthly), cleaned and both 
buyers and suppliers are adequately deduplicated; and it can be 
downloaded in bulk, making it available as an Open Contracting Data 
Standard (OCDS) to enable interoperability. Besides, it will be 
designed, developed, maintained and monitored transparently and in close 
collaboration with all relevant stakeholders and user groups.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, we will be working to develop this tool further and we are 
looking for contributors who would like to get involved or fund the project. Get in touch via

<h2 id="device-neutrality"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>Device Neutrality: taking control of devices</h2>

<p>We started the Device Neutrality initiative to raise awareness about 
the increasing loss of end-user control over technology. In our 
increasingly technology-dependent societies, <a 
href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index">Device Neutrality</a> aims to 
put control back in the hands of end users, allowing them to bypass 
gatekeepers and use Free Software on their devices in a 
non-discriminatory way.</p>
 
<p>2022 ended with the important step of <a 
href="/news/2022/news-20221206-01.html">the adoption of the Digital 
Markets Act</a> by the European Parliament. This legislation introduces the 
principle of Device Neutrality, although it does not set
open standards as the default for defining interoperability.</p>

<p>In 2023 we have continued our efforts to bring Device Neutrality into 
the European legislation. We have also deepened this concept with in a 
<a href="/news/podcast/episode-20.html">podcast episode</a> and worked 
on the creation of a dedicated landing page on
this topic, which will be online soon, and of course, we have continued to try to achieve Router 
Freedom in Europe and with our Upcycling Android campaign.</p>

<h3 id="routerfreedom"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>Router Freedom: a EU demand</h3>
<p>Router Freedom is the right of customers of an Internet 
Service Provider (ISP) to choose and use a private router instead of a 
router that the ISP forces them to use. But some Internet service 
providers in Europe dishonour this principle by dictating which device 
their customers have to use in order to connect to the Internet, or by 
discriminating against the owners of alternative devices. This 
undermining of our basic freedom of choice is strongly opposed by the 
Free Software Foundation Europe and many other organisations, projects, 
and individuals. <a href="/activities/routers/routers.html">Router 
Freedom</a> is not merely a topic for experts. It 
affects us all.</p>

<ul>
	<li>EU Survey: More than a thousand consumers from across Europe have 
	shared their experiences of ISPs' commercial practices in <a 
	href="/news/2023/news-20230515-02.html">our pan- European survey</a> 
	regarding freedom of terminal equipment, resulting in <a 
	href="/news/2023/news-20230515-01.html">a call for 
	Router Freedom</a>.</li>
	
	<li>Router Freedom as priority for the future 
	of Net Neutrality regulation: The EU Commission has published <a 
	href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/e1f1154f-ee2f-11ed-a05c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-285823692">a 
	study on the future of Net Neutrality regulation</a>, confirming Router 
	Freedom as a priority for the future implementation of Open 
	Internet in Europe. (Recommendation 2, p. 91). The study refers to the
	FSFE's work (p.11) and supports the conclusions we at the FSFE have been 
	advocating for the last few years. In particular, national regulators 
	should prioritise end-user rights and ensure terminal freedom for all 
	network types, including fibre (FTTH).</li>
	
	<li>Our staff and volunteers have been working to bring Router Freedom to the national level.  Thanks to 
	their efforts, <a href="/news/2022/news-20221215-01.html">Belgium is 
	working to ensure Router Freedom</a> and 
	<a href="/news/2022/news-20221215-01.html">Greece is also ensuring
	Router Freedom</a> although it excludes fibre connections. However 
	there is still a long way to go as <a 
	href="/news/2023/news-20230915-01.html">in Germany, for example, telcos 
	want to exclude fibre from Router 
	Freedom</a>, which goes against the German law and the EU regulatory 
	framework of net neutrality.</li>

  </figure>


<p>“Upcycling Android" is the name of an initiative that the FSFE has 
been running for the last few years and that was officially ended in March 
2023. Launched in November 2021, <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/">Upcycling Android</a> initiative helps people to flash 
their phones with Free Software operating systems and promotes the 
right for every user to install any software on any device. Moreover, 
upcycling our devices is an important step to rethinking our short-term, 
linear consumption of electronic devices in favour of a circular 
economy.</p>

<p>The initiative held workshops, developed policy recommendations, 
and received a lot of attention:</p>

<ul>
	<li> <p><strong>Workshops:</strong> A total of 12 workshops were 
	organised by the FSFE, consisting of a short introduction, a joint 
	flashing of phones with a question and answer session, followed by 
	individual flashing of phones, and ending with tips and tricks for 
	further using Free Software on mobile phones with F-Droid and 
	microG.</p> 
	<p>Some of the workshops were held at international 
	conferences (Bolzano), others in public spaces and libraries (Bonn, 
	Berlin), in a university environment (HAW Hamburg), in a local 
	hackerspace (Frankfurt, Berlin) or a repair café 
	(Korschenbroich-Herrenshoff), and even at the Federal Environment 
	Agency.</p> 
	<p>An online <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/uZZYCA31SzTT5bMpNaDzz3">“Train the Trainers” workshop</a> was 
	also held to teach people about how to organise their own workshops.</p>
     </li>

  alt="Illustration with the words Free Software and a phone with a screen going out the phone with more illustrations about Free Software"/>
  </figure>
    
	<li><p><strong>Information and background material:</strong> Throughout the 
	campaign, <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/informationmaterial.html">the FSFE has created various resources</a> (posters, infographics, 
	stickers, flyers, brochures, video...), published under 
	Creative Commons licences and in digital form on the initiative's 
	website. Thus, even after the project has ended, this material can be 
	freely used by others who want to continue promoting the use of Free 
	Software, while overcoming software obsolescence and extending the life 
	of our hardware.</p> <p>In addition, technical documentation, including 
	<a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/p/u4Ki6gTKu4dr2FKs7yiu14">videos showing how to flash different terminals</a>, has been created to 
	enable the workshops offered to be reproduced independently during and 
	after the end of the project.</p>
	</li>
     
	<li>
	<p><strong>Open Letter:</strong> to European Union legislators on <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/openletter.html">"The 
	universal right to install any software on any device"</a>. As part of this 
	initiative, this Open Letter sets out four key demands to enable a more 
	sustainable use of electronic products and devices in the European 
	Union. It has already been signed by more than 150 civil society 
	organisations, many of them not previously involved in Free Software, 
	from different sectors, as well as more than 3000 individuals. In 
	particular, the signatory organisations ensure further virality of the 
	campaign within their own target groups.</p>

	<li> 
	<p><strong>Outreach:</strong> Throughout the initiative, outreach was 
	done through press releases, news articles, social media posts using 
	the hashtag #UpcyclingAndroid, podcasts and various presentations at 
	various international conferences. The materials we produced helped us 
	reach different audiences, and our volunteers and civil society 
	organisations also picked up on our messages. Thank you for spreading 
	the word.</p> 
	
	<p>The book <a href="https://publication2023.bits-und-baeume.org/">‘Shaping Digital Transformation 
	for a sustainable society’</a>, published this year, is a collection of 
	28 papers from the second Bits &amp; Trees conference on digitalisation 
	and sustainability. In a chapter entitled 'Making the telecom 
	sector more sustainable with Free Software', Lucas Lasota and Erik 
	Albers explain how Free Software is key to a more sustainable 
	telecom sector by giving end-users more control over devices, 
	especially with regard to artificial obsolescence of software and 
	hardware.</p> 
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This initiative has officially ended, but there is still work to be 
done. You can continue to demonstrate the benefits of unlocking your 
devices by organising a workshop, signing the Open Letter... All the 
documentation, information and materials are there. And remember, <a

does not void its warranty</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, the FSFE has celebrated our devotion to Free Software on the 
annual "I Love Free Software Day" on 14 February 2023.</p>

<p>This year, we celebrated it with Free Software enthusiasts through <a 
href="/activities/ilovefs/report/report_2023.html">various events 
across Europe</a> (Berlin, Madrid, Thessaloniki, 
Potteries, Zurich, Frankfurt, Barcelona, online in Italy). For the 
first time, the FSFE's women's group participated by organising a meeting.  
Besides the FSFE, many other organisations and individuals joined us to 
publicly show their love for Free Software and their appreciation for 
all 
the wonderful contributors without whom Free Software would not be 
possible. ❤️ Thank you!</p>

<p>Apart from all the events and activities on the day itself, we also have <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#ilovefs">
new postcards and stickers</a>. Many Free Software projects have 
received a hand-written thank-you postcard, thanking them for their 
continued and wonderful work for software freedom.</p>

<p>And we are already working on next years’ celebration so save the 
date: 'I Love Free Software Day 2024: start software freedom' will take 
place on 14 February 2024.</p>

<h3 id="podcast"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>Software Freedom Podcast</h3>
<p>The FSFE’s Software Freedom Podcast has continued throughout the year, with  6 new episodes.</p>
<p>This year, the podcast covered topics such as European politics, 
Device Neutrality, the importance of Free Software in medical devices, 
cryptography and privacy and Free Software in France.</p>

<h3 id="fediverse"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>Free Software and Federated social networks</h3>

<p>The FSFE is active on Peertube and Mastodon. We created our own 
Peertube instance, media.fsfe.org, to share our videos on a Free 
Software platform and we currently have about 776  subscribers. Remember 
to subscribe if you want to be informed about our latest videos.</p>

<p>Our presence on Mastodon has also grown, and we currently have more than 
12,700 followers! It is also great to see how more and more people and 
organisations are joining these and other decentralised social networks.</p>
 
<p><strong>FediGov:</strong> The FSFE Swiss local group launched, with GNU/Linux.ch, an 
initiative to encourage public institutions to use federated Free 
Software solutions to communicate with their people. <a href="https://fedigov.eu/">FediGov</a> is the 
name of this campaign, which also encourages people to ask their governments to adopt ethical communication.</p>

<p><strong>Fediverse Education Day:</strong> The FSFE, the Centre for 
Civic Education of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the Adult 
Education Centre Cologne organised a public symposium on the Fediverse, 
its functionalities, its potentials and ways to use it for public 
institutions and administrations. More than 70 guests attended the event 
and we will publish the videos of the presentations soon.</p>

<h3 id="video"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>‘What is Free Software’ Video</h3>

<p>We continued to spread the word with our 'What is Free Software'
video.  The video was released last year so we focused on spreading the 
word about it and translating it into more languages. Thanks to 
our translators and a fundraising campaign, we now have the video currently 
in several European languages: Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, 
Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish:</p>

<h2 id="community"><span id="anchor"></span><span id="anchor-1"></span>Back to the stages, the booths, and “the hugs”!</h2> 
<p>The last few months of 2022 have brought us back to the stage after 
years of online conferences. We couldn't be happier to see old friends 
and meet new ones in person. Our team took part in a wide variety of 
conferences, giving talks and running stands.</p>

<p>Our “season” started with SFSCON in Bolzano, where we enjoyed not 
only a fruitful conference with our second Legal Education Day, the 
first Italian community  meeting, and many interesting talks, but also 
some fun and networking time, such as our well-known Pizza Evening.</p>

<p>At the beginning of February, we travelled to Brussels for FOSDEM!  
We were really pleased to see so many of you there! Our booth was really 
busy with people wanting to know a bit more about us, participants who 
heard our colleagues talked and wanted more information, and lots of 
old friends just stopping by to say hello. Check out  <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230227-01.html">our talks at 
FOSDEM 2023</a> and the videos from the Legal &amp; Policy Devroom, 
which we co-hosted together with Software Freedom Conservancy.</p>

<p>The spring found us attending foss-north, where we co-organised a <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230509-01.html">track on 
political, social, and legal issues</a> around 
Free Software</p>

   <figcaption>Map showing the different events that we have around Europe</figcaption>
  </figure>
  

<p>None of these events would have been possible without the help of our 
community! The backbone of the Free Software Foundation Europe's work is 
its active network of Free Software advocates and volunteers who help 
promote and spread the benefits of Free Software across Europe. Their 
contribution and dedication allows us to continue our campaigns, lend a 
hand to our team during our events, and help set up a booth.</p>

<p>
Our local groups have been meeting throughout these months: some have 
returned to face-to-face meetings, others have continued with online 
meetings, and 
others are mixing it up, and we even have new communication channels... Each
option is good to engage in fruitful discussions, to deepen some 
concepts and ideas, to meet others with the same interests and even to 
get active in developing new activities.
</p>

<p>Our team of translators has done an extraordinary job. In the last 
twelve months, we have added <strong>340 new translations</strong> to 
our website! And we have around 318 new pages in English!</p>

  alt="Summer meeting group picture"/>
  </figure>

<p>This year we also started online coordinators' meetings. The aim of 
these meetings is to discuss different topics with our coordinators and 
to learn from each other's experiences. The meetings are also a tool to 
network with coordinators from other countries.</p>

<p>But this year we also wanted to spend time with our volunteers in a more 
relaxed environment and thank you in person for all your contributions. 
The Linux Hotel hosted us for a summer meeting weekend where we shared 
information about our current activities and campaigns, learned from the 
experience and knowledge of our volunteers, and had a really good time!</p>
