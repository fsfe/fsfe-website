<h1>Sustainability podcast +++ Job opportunity +++ Partial Router Freedom in Greece</h1>

<p>
  In this issue we share an uplifting podcast episode on the progress 
  of the Upcycling Android campaign. We have a work position in the 
  FSFE staff. Greece is about to secure Router Freedom except for fiber 
  connections. Community news comes from Aarhus, Barcelona, Berlin, 
  Hamburg, Vienna, Zurich, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Translators, 
  and Women.

<p>
  In recent years the FSFE has highlighted software sustainability, 
  launched a campaign encouraging people to reclaim their phones with 
  Free Software, and made recommendations for the EU Ecodesign 
  criteria. Erik Albers, who is working for the FSFE on those 
  activities, tells the thrilling story of the Upcycling Android 
  campaign. The campaign has been a big success. It offered workshops, 
  shared policy recommendations, and has made it to press with these 
  activities.

   Our <a

   letter</a> for the right to install any software on any device was 
   well received. 90 entities signed, including the Nature And 
   Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU), EDRi – European Digital 
   Rights, and the European Right to Repair Campaign. Volunteers 
   translated it into 9 languages: Catalan, German, Greek, Spanish, 
   French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, and Polish. <a

<h2 id="greece-takes-one-step-to-secure-router-freedom-but-leaves-fiber-out">Greece takes one step to secure Router Freedom but leaves fiber out</h2>

<p>
  <a href="/news/2022/news-20220628-01.html">Greece is one step closer 
  to securing Router Freedom, but the regulator is excluding fiber 
  (FTTH) connections from the legislation</a>. A coalition of 
  organisations is now requesting the regulator, EETT, to reconsider 
  this and thus safeguard the freedom of all users. The FSFE 
  coordinated the work of the coalition.
</p>

<p>
  The EETT has taken a courageous position to set the position of the network termination point (NTP) at the passive point for common networks. It should equally guarantee the free choice of terminal equipment for the next generations and emerging technologies. Users who are connected to the internet using fiber connections should not be excluded from choosing their own router.
