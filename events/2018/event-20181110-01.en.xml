		<title>FSFE with a booth at OSHWDem in A Coruña, Spain</title> 
 
		<body> 
			<p>In the third consecutive year, the FSFE will run a booth at OSHWDem, a faire about Free Software and free hardware. OSHWDem is well known in A Coruña with plenty of visitors from the city and also outside, counting with the presence of lot of Free Software and hardware advocates. We look forward to many interesting talks and hopefully also find people to start a local FSFE group and/or a local language translation group.</p>
