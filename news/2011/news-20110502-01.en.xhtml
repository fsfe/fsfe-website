	<h1>FSFE submits its reply to the EC on consultation on collective redress</h1>

	<p newsteaser="yes">Free Software Foundation Europe has sent its <a href="http://fsfe.org/projects/eu/20110429.CollectiveRedress.Response.FSFE.pdf">
	contribution</a> to the European Commision's public consultation on identification of common
legal principles on collective redress.
</p>

	<p>"Collective redress" is a legal concept where citizens and businesses,
harmed by illegal behaviour of the same company, are allowed to bundle
their claims in a single procedure to simplify the process and reduce
costs.	</p>
	
	<p>
Being concerned with numerous complaints over pre-installed Microsoft
Windows operating system, FSFE has provided the EC with its vision of
the main principles of the collective redress procedure in the EU which
may substantially increase chances to obtain "Windows tax refund".
