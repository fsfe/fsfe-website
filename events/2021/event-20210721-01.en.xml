        <title>FSFE Netherlands online get-together (online) (online)</title>

    <body>
      <p>On the 21st of June, the FSFE Netherlands will have another online localgroup meeting. The meeting will be from 20:00 until 21:00 CEST on the conference server. It is usually quite 'gezellig' and so most stay until 22:30, but you can leave whenever you see fit. The meeting is open for everybody, and we'll switch to English if not everybody understands Dutch. At the meetings we abide by the FSFE Code of Conduct. To join the meeting please send an email to country coordinator Nico Rikken (nico[dot]rikken[at]fsfe[dot]org), he will send you the meeting link and access code.</p>
