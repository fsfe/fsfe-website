    <h1>Support FSFE</h1>

<p>We ask you to help us tackle these challenges head-on. FSFE is financed through your
donations. As an individual, please [[https://fellowship.fsfe.org/][join the Fellowship]]. As a company, please [[http://fsfe.org/donate][donate to
FSFE]]. Join the many Fellows, or other [[http://fsfe.org/donate/thankgnus.en.html][individuals and companies]] who support our work, and help to keep us independent. Together, we can build a better society for all.</p>
<p>Donations to FSFE are tax-deductible in Germany, Switzerland and the
Netherlands. Less than 20% of our budget is spent on overhead costs,
and we are looking to further reduce this figure as we grow and
existing structures scale up.</p>
