    <h1>Associate Organisations of the FSFE</h1>

    <p>
      Associate organisations are independent of the Free Software
      Foundation Europe and entirely autonomous. They are completely
      self-run and -managed in all aspects (such as membership,
      statutes, finances and so on).
    </p>

    <p>
      Being associate means being formally allied and having immediate
      access to the FSFE. So associates are usually involved in the
      internal communication and consideration process. Also we will
      work together for campaigns and events such as tradeshows.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are interested in the associate status, please consider to read <a href="/associates/about.html">what it means to be an associate of FSFE and how to become one</a>.
