<h1>20 Years FSFE: Interview with Vincent Lequertier on AI</h1>

  <p>
	In our sixth birthday publication we are interviewing Vincent 
	Lequertier about crucial aspects of artificial intelligence, such 
	as its transparency, its connection to Open Science, and questions 
	of copyright. Vincent also recommends further readings and responds 
	to 20 Years FSFE.
  </p>

 <p>
   A PhD candidate at the Claude Bernard university in Lyon who 
   researches artificial intelligence for healthcare, Vincent supports 
   software freedom and volunteers for the FSFE in his free time. He 
   has been a part of the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Teams/System-Hackers">System Hackers</a>,
   the team responsible for the technical infrastructure of the FSFE, 
   for many years. His contribution was valuable in setting the 
   foundation for the good state System Hackers are in today. Vincent 
   is also a member of the FSFE General Assembly, and he volunteers in 
   the 'Public Money? Public Code!' campaign. In this interview, 
   Vincent shares his thoughts answering questions about the current 
   state of AI and its future implications.

  <p>
	<strong> FSFE: You are deeply involved in the field of artificial 
	intelligence. How would you explain to a 10-year-old what AI 
	is?</strong>
  </p>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
	<strong>Vincent Lequertier:</strong> A few years ago I was a 
	speaker at a local radio station, and sometimes I was responsible 
	for mixing the audio. At the station, there were several inputs: the 
	mics of the radio speakers (mine included), the music, the jingles, 
	and so on. And then there was the output broadcast to the radio 
	listeners. Between the inputs and output there was the mixing 
	table, with its uncountable knobs and sliders. I needed to adjust 
	the knobs and sliders so that the inputs were well mixed together, 
	thus producing an output that sounded nice to the listeners. At the 
	time of writing, an AI works just like that. It automatically adjusts 
	the numerous parameters of a digital, virtual mixing table. 
	Once put through it, the inputs produce a satisfying output 
	according to a predefined definition of success (that the sound was 
	nice in this analogy).

<div class="question">
  <p>
	<strong>You are advocating for accessible and transparent AI. 
	According to your research, what would you say are the necessary 
	requirements to make sure that programs using artificial 
	intelligence are accessible and transparent?</strong>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
 <p>
  Reusing AIs makes sense because they are costly to develop and 
  train, both in terms of human and computer resources. Additionally, 
  training AI models demands a lot of data which are particularly hard 
  to obtain and work with. Therefore, being able to reuse an AI is 
  important, as it saves time and potentially scarce resources. 
  Moreover, making an AI available to others fosters innovation by 
  facilitating collaboration. I think a fundamental requirement for AI 
  accessibility is Free Software, because AIs licensed as Free Software 
  (also known as Open Source) are inherently accessible. Other 
  requirements can be Open Standards and Open Data. AI models should 
  therefore be published and freely accessible.
 </p>
 
 <p>
  Transparency in AI is the ability to understand and interpret the 
  output coming from it. Although given the complexity of today's AI 
  systems transparency can be hard to obtain, it is an important 
  characteristic as it fosters trust. <strong>Being able to understand why a 
  given output was produced, and what part contributed the most to it, 
  increases confidence in the model and makes it easier to debug.</strong> 
  Moreover, understanding the role played by each input can help 
  data-driven policy making. For example, in healthcare, understanding 
  the most important factors impacting the quality of patients' care 
  for a disease can validate or change healthcare practices. Free 
  Software is a key part of transparency because it allows everyone to 
  use the AI and analyze its predictions to better understand them.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p>
	<strong>How can we make sure that inequalities in our current 
	societies do not pass on to AI data training? How can we assure 
	that AI results are fair?</strong>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
 <p>
  As AI is really good at magnifying existing inequalities found in the 
  data used for its training, fairness issues will creep into AI. 
  Detecting those issues in the dataset and in the AI's output is 
  therefore critical. However, simply removing data that might be a 
  source for unfairness (e.g. a training dataset variable that is not 
  representative of the data used once the model is put in production) 
  may not always work, because these data might be correlated to other 
  attributes in the dataset which would need to be removed as well. 
  Completely removing any potential inequality may therefore remove a 
  lot of data from the dataset, potentially limiting the ability 
  of the AI to properly address the problem it has been designed to 
  solve. Inequalities therefore come from badly constructed datasets, 
  and advanced methods are required to circumvent them.
 </p>
  
 <blockquote>
  Data related to COVID-19 are public, and <a href="https://covidtracker.fr/">the most popular website</a> to 
  visualize these data as well as other tools <a href="https://github.com/CovidTrackerFr">are Free Software</a>.  
 </blockquote>


 <p>
  To detect fairness issues, a definition of fairness must be decided 
  upon. For example, fairness may be defined as whether pairs of 
  similar individuals get similar predictions (individual fairness), or 
  it may be defined as whether predictions are similar across a 
  majority and minority group according to some characteristics (group 
  fairness). This fairness measure may be computed once the AI has 
  been trained to identify potential unfairness, or may be computed 
  during the AI training so that it can take the notion of fairness 
  into account when it adjusts its parameters.  
 </p>

 <p>
  Free Software is also important here, as it <strong>allows everyone to check 
  for fairness issues, whether by inspecting the source code or by 
  running the AI directly and analysing its predictions.</strong>

<div class="question">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Your research focuses on healthcare, a field that has universally 
   raised the question of supporting Open Science. To what extent are 
   health metrics and biometrics open? Is artificial intelligence for 
   healthcare a big and globally collaborative aim or independent and 
   competitive?
  </strong>
 </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
 <p>
  Well, it depends! Because of security and privacy, access to 
  individualized healthcare metrics is often restricted and each study 
  using them must be approved by a ethical committee. However, 
  aggregated statistics may be widely available. For example, the 
  website data.gouv.fr has a <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/donnees-sante/">section 
  dedicated to healthcare</a>. Also, the data related to COVID-19 are 
  public, and <a href="https://covidtracker.fr/">the most popular 
  website</a> to visualize these data as well as other tools <a href="https://github.com/CovidTrackerFr">are Free Software</a>.   
 </p>

 <blockquote>
  The openness and collaborative aspects of research on AI will 
  improve, partly because scientific journals encourage researchers to 
  share all the research materials, including source code, and also 
  because funding institutions can also ask them to do so. [...]   I also think that the 
  line of reasoning around our &quot;<a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money? Public 
  Code!</a>&quot; campaign applies for AI research.
 </blockquote>

 <p>
  However, it should be noted that data without enough granularity can 
  reduce the AI&#39;s performance in healthcare, as, just like humans, 
  an AI application needs to have detailed information, especially if 
  the goal of the AI is to make predictions at the individual level. 
  Because healthcare outcomes are so dependent on context, prediction 
  abilities depend on specific healthcare situations. More open data 
  and more Free Software (i.e. Open Science) make it easier to 
  collaborate. A shared dataset released under a Free Software licence creates a &quot;playground&quot; where AI 
  models can be easily compared and where we can create benchmarking 
  tasks, such as hospital length of stay prediction. Without a proper 
  benchmarking task, finding methodological improvements is harder. An 
  example of an open dataset for healthcare is <a href="https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/">MIMIC</a>.
  Also, a lot of papers about AI research are freely available on arxiv.org. I 
  think the openness and collaborative aspects of research on AI will 
  improve, partly because scientific journals encourage researchers to 
  share all the research materials, including source code, and also 
  because funding institutions can also ask them do do so. For example 
  the Horizon 2020 program of the European Union <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/open-science-open-access">values 
  Open Science</a>.
 </p>

 <p>
  I also think that the line of reasoning around our &quot;<a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money? Public Code!</a>&quot; 
  campaign applies for AI research.
 </p>
</div>


<div class="question">
 <p>
  <strong>
   A common expectation for the future of AI is that it can have abrupt 
   economical and societal impact by making many job positions 
   redundant. Do you see this as a possibility for the upcoming years? 
   If so, is there any practice that could alleviate these 
   consequences? Would Free Software be one?
  </strong>
 </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
 <p>        
  I think AI has come a long way in the last ten years. It is more and 
  more able to organize and structure information. The fields which 
  have made the most impressive progress are natural language 
  processing (i.e. tasks involving text such as sentiment analysis) and 
  computer vision (i.e. tasks involving images such as image 
  classification). In natural language processing, deep learning models 
  can semantically understand words and documents as well as the 
  relationships between them. So I think the jobs where AI will be able 
  to assist us (I consider things only from a technical point of view 
  here) are the jobs dealing with a lot of structured information that 
  needs to be understood, processed, and memorized, as AI is becoming 
  better at this than us. For example, AI-based software has shown 
  good results in assisting in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6268174/">radiology</a>, 
  legal document analysis, and programming (see next question). So 
  it&#39;s possible that AI makes people more efficient, which would 
  reduce the amount of human work required. However, this work would 
  require skills where AI does not work well at the time of writing, 
  such as creativity or emphatic and thoughtful communication.
 </p>

  href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6268174/">radiology</a>, 
  legal document analysis, and programming. 
 </blockquote>

 <p>
  If AI is bound to get better, and will at some point have the 
  capacity to completely automate some work, transparency and fairness 
  can only become more and more important.  Although not sufficient, 
  Free Software is a big part of what helps putting strong 
  safeguards in place.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, I don't think it's up to the scientific community to design 
  policies around employment. Putting together a proof of concept or 
  finding a novel theory that could automate some work is not a reason 
  for implanting it in everyday lives. In the past years, the EU has 
  already had to deal with AI applications that are impressive 
  technically but raise ethical concerns. For example, the Clearview AI 
  facial recognition platform has been judged illegal in some EU 
  countries, and citizens have the right to opt out from this 
  technology. The next few years will be important with regard to AI 
  ethical concerns, and the upcoming EU Artificial Intelligence Act 
  might play a big role in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  And finally, although I'm not a historian, I think that over the last 
  centuries we have made tremendous technological progress and 
  society has always evolved along with it. Thinking about the past 
  challenges of technological improvements would help us to 
  understand whether they would be different this time around, and how to 
  deal with them as best as we can.

<div class="question">
 <p>
  <strong>
   What legal issues do you think will be raised regarding AI in the 
   next ten years? Would it be issues of ownership or responsibility? 
   For example, we are already seeing ethical and technical aspects of 
   the AI ownership in  Github&#39;s Copilot. <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/fsf-funded-call-for-white-papers-on-philosophical-and-legal-questions-around-copilot">A 
   study</a> on this topic will be conducted with FSF&#39;s support. We 
   are interested to know what the upcoming crucial questions are, 
   according to you.
  </strong>
 </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
 <p>
  Issues around ownership and responsibility will be very important, 
  and Copilot is a prime example of that, where the fundamental 
  question is whether AI creations can be considered as novel ideas, 
  and, if they do, whether they are copyrightable on their own. 
  Specifically on Copilot, the fact that a code completion tool may 
  yield <a href="https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1410886329924194309">straight 
  copies of licensed work</a> can be problematic, as, at the time of 
  writing, the AI does not know the licence under which the source of 
  autocompleted code is released, and how the licence should be 
  respected. For example, to the best of my knowledge, it is not clear 
  whether code autocompleted by Copilot originally released under the 
  GNU Public Licence makes the rest of the project a derivative work. 
  Being able to freely use source code often comes with obligations 
  that need to be fulfilled, regardless of whether it is accessed by an 
  AI or a human being. Our <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE 
  project</a>, which aims to make it easier to programmatically 
  understand how a project and its diverse components are licensed, may 
  help building licensing-aware programming tools. The same legal 
  troubles apply to other models able to generate content, in domains 
  such as in painting or in music production.  
 </p>
    
 <p>
  Another legal issue is with patents, where <strong>the question of 
  whether an AI can be a patent author is still undecided</strong>. In 
  the UK and EU, a patent whose inventor was an AI was rejected because 
  they considered that AI does not have a legal personality and cannot 
  have a legal right over its output. But a couple of months ago, <a 
  href="https://theconversation.com/in-a-world-first-south-africa-grants-patent-to-an-artificial-intelligence-system-165623">the 
  first patent which lists AI as the inventor was approved</a>.
 </p>
</div>

 <blockquote>

  novel ideas, and, if they do, whether they are copyrightable on their 
  own.    
 </blockquote>

<div class="question">
 <p>
  <strong>
   Is there any book about artificial intelligence you would like to recommend to our readers?
  </strong>
 </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">

 <p>
  I can't recommend "Genesis" from Bernard Beckett enough. It is a 
  small novel showing a philosophical debate around the questions of 
  what it means to be human and of whether machines can have 
  consciousness. The classic "I, Robot" from Isaac Asimov also raises 
  many questions that make a lot of sense today (it was published in 
  1950!) If we are building autonomous robots with some freedom of 
  action, what safeguards must we put in place? The book is really 
  about how to ensure AI works as intended.

<div class="question">
 <p>
  <strong>
   You have been a part of the FSFE for several years. What is an 
   important thing that you learnt from this experience?
  </strong>
 </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
 <p>
  I learnt that Free Software can be viewed from a lot of different 
  angles and is not only a technical topic. This translates into the 
  diversity and breadth of our community. This diversity is a huge 
  strength.
 </p>
</div>


<div class="question">
 <p>
  <strong>
   And what is a story that still makes you smile when you remember it? 
  </strong>
 </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
 <p>
  My first FOSDEM in 2019. I met some awesome people from our 
  community. That was really heartwarming.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p>
    <strong>As a last question, what do you wish the FSFE for the next 20 years?</strong>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
 <p>
  I wish the FSFE will be able to tackle the challenges ahead. The next 
  years will be full of innovations that will make technology even more 
  ubiquitous in our lives. I hope we will be able to keep spreading the 
  word about Free Software and the values behind it.

<h3>About "20 Years FSFE"</h3>

  <p>
    In 2021 the Free Software Foundation Europe turns 20. This means 
    two decades of <a href="/about/about.html">empowering users to 
    control technology</a>. 
  </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/53aeebdafa0a0c83324dcafc1e4bef1c.png" alt="Banner with FSFE 20 years. FSFE since 2001" />
    </figure>
  <p>
    Turning 20 is a time when we like to take a breath and to look back 
    on the road we have come, to reflect the milestones we have passed, 
    the successes we have achieved, the stories we have written, and 
    the moments that brought us together and that we will always 
    joyfully  remember. In 2021 we want to give momentum to the 
    FSFE and even more to our pan-European community, the community 
    that has formed  and always will form the shoulders that our 
    movement relies on. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>20 Years FSFE is meant to be a celebration of everyone who 
    has accompanied us in the past or still does. Thank you for your 
    place in the structure of the FSFE today and for setting the 
    foundation for the next decades of software freedom to 
    come.</strong>
