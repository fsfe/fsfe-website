		<title>European Licensing and Legal Workshop</title>
		<body>
  <p>
			FSFE's Freedom Task Force will host the first European Licensing and Legal Workshop for Free Software on Friday the 11th of April in Amsterdam, 
			The Netherlands. The venue for this meeting is the InterContinental Amstel Hotel.  The event is targeted towards large projects and medium to 
			large enterprises wishing to discuss their existing licence compliance processes. Parties attending are expected to contribute to issues 
			ranging from process development through to optimising purchasing contract language for the benefit of the European Free Software community.  
			This workshop has limited space available and therefore attendance is by invitation only. Projects and companies interested in attending this 
			event should contact the FTF at ftf at fsfeurope.org.
