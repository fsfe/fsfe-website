  <h2 class="painted">What means "upcycling"?</h2>

  <p>The manufacturer of your Android Smartphone does not anymore offer you recent updates of your phone? You are faced with the dilemma of either buying a new phone or keep running and outdated system? Learn on this page how you can install and use a Free Software operating system on your phone that keeps you up to date and puts you back in control of your device.</p>

  <h3>What exactly happens?</h3>

  <p>In order to extend usage lifetime of your phone and to get back full control of your device so you can self-determine when it is too old for further usage or not you can install a so-called "Custom ROM". Custom ROMs are Android alternatives based on the original operating system. Every time a new Android version is published there are multiple companies and communities who take the release code and re-publish it in a modified version. These versions usually exclude Google dependencies and software, hence are lightweight and slim. This comes with another benefit, that these Custom ROMs are easier to install on phones with less hardware capacities. But the biggestt benefit is that these Custom ROMs often get packaged for phones whose initial manufacturers do not support anymore. So if you manufacturer sold your phone with Android version X and does not offer you its follow up release, the Android version x+1, it is very likely a modified Custom ROM of Android version x+1 can be installed on your phone.</p>

  <h3>Unlocking the bootloader</h3>

  <p>In order to be able to install a Custom ROM however, you initially need to unlock your bootloader. The bootloader is an underlying software level on top of which you install the operating system. As a security measure, when you buy a new phone the booloader is locked by default. This security measure however also prevents you from taking control of your device by installing an alternative operating system. Even if this alternative is a more up-to-date version of your Android and thus in sum offers more security in your daily use.</p>

  <p>Some phones are easy to unlock the bootloader, others are not. It totally depends on your supplier and manufacturer of the phone. Please note that we cannot offer you online or remote help with this process. You are welcome to participate in one of <a href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/workshops.html">our workshops</a>. Apart from that you usually find help when you look for "unlock bootloader" at your manufacturer's homepage. Apart from that there are many forums, platforms, magazines and other websites available who offer guides on how to unlock your bootloader in different qualities.</p>

  <h4>Fear around unlocking bootloader </h4>

  <p>Be aware that manufacturers often like to scare you away from unlocking your bootloader. Not only that they make you a hard time doing so but they also claim that you void your warranty. <a href="/activities/android/flashingdevices.html">Following the analysis of the FSFE's legal experts</a> this is however not true: <em>"Unless the seller can prove that modifying the software, rooting your device or flashing it with some other OS or firmware was the cause for the defect,"</em> you are covered by the  “compulsory warranty” as it is described in the European Directive 1999/44/CE. Also be aware however, that during the process of unlocking your bootloader you can brick your phone. This should however not happen if you are careful and follow the recommendations.</p>

  <h3>Advantages of unlocking the bootloader</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>You can flash custom ROM and custom recovery on your device</li>
    <li>You can root your smartphone.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Using and choosing your phone model</h2>

  <p>Some phones are easier to upcycle then others. This is because some manufacturers make it hard for you to upcycle your phone so that you buy a new one instead of renewing the old one. Some even want to prevent you from unlocking your bootloader by using heavy <a href="httops://drm.info">digital restriction management</a> and downgrade your hardware if you do. If you already have a phone, find help and consequences on unlocking your bootloader on the manufacturer's pages or in specific communities in the Internet.</p>

  <p>If you are currently in need to buy a new phone it is recommendable to choose your phone based on its easiness to unlock its booloader. Not only do you make yourself a more easy time but also do you support more open phones with your choice. As a general note meanwhile there are several phones that come with a Custom ROM pre-installed. This is of course the easiest option since they took away all the burden already and offer you an easy-to-use experience. Apart from that the Google phones are easy to unlock. Although it sounds contradictory first, that the Google phones are the ones where it is easiest to install an alternative openrating system without any Google dependencies and software. This is because Google's business is not selling phones but developing the software. They like developers to play around with the hardware and their business model does not depend on them buying a new phone every year or two.

  <h2>Flashing a Custom ROM</h2>

  <p>"Flashing" is the process of installing a new operating system on your phone. This can be a successor of current operating system or an alternative version, a custom ROM. You can only install a custom ROM if you have successfully unlocked your bootloader (see above). </p>

  <h3>Choosing a custom ROM</h3>

  <p>If you want to install an alternative operating system on your phone, there are many many ROMs to choose from. Some of them are closer to the original Android, others are more separated. Some include more Free Software components or pre-installations than others. Some have the focus on security, others on usability, others on modularity. The amount of custom ROMs to choose from can be compelling in the beginning. But in the end the choice gets limited by the phone model you have and the type of system you like to have, so it boils down to a overseeable number. We collected some of the more prominent ones on our <a href="/activities/android/android.html">free your android pages</a>.</p>

  <h3>Discovering the world of free software</h3>

  <p>Free Software is the base of what is what runs most part of our digital infrastructure and our devices. The Internet heavily relies on the innovations and accessbility of Free Software. And ever more growing since the last years it is also available on your smartphone.</p>

  <p>Free Software is <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">sustainable software</a>. Not only will the software be available for everyone everytime, it is also helpful from an ecological point of view. Free Software is also <a href="/activities/android/android.html">good for your privacy</a>. It helps you to keep control over your data. And, as you can see on this page, it also helps you to reduce ewaste and to upcycle your phone.</p>

  <p>After upcycling your phone and installing a Free Software operating system on it you have the choice to manually post-install the Google software and libraries and be exposed to their data collection again. Or to keep control over your software and data and use your phone with as many Free Software apps as possible. This can be your entrance into a world full of Free Software. </p>

  <p>Discoverin the Free Software world on your mobile phone usually works with a Free Software app store called F-Droid and a replacement for the Google libraries called MicroG. If you both installed you can additionall install the Aurora store to get all the apps you might be missing from the Google Play store. We do however recommend to look for Free Software alternatives in F-Droid. Any app you can replace with a Free Software one is your step towards a more eco-friendly and user-friendly digital environment.</p>

  
  <h4>F-Droid</h4>

  <p>The F-Droid initiative was started to change the sad Free Software app situation in the Android world. It builds a repository of easily-installable Free Software apps for the Android platform. In practice this means that you can use F-Droid just as you might be used to use the Google Play store. There is an Android client application that makes it easy to browse Free Software applications, install them onto your device, and keep track of updates. <a href="/activities/android/liberate.html#F-Droid">Read more about F-Droid and recommended apps</a> on our Free Your Android Pages.</p>


  <h4>MicroG</h4>

  <p>MicroG is a "Free Software re-implementation of Google’s proprietary Android user space apps and libraries". In practice that means it allows other Free Software apps to seamlessly integrate into the Android system without having to use Google software for this. Although most microG components are far from complete, users are amazed by the results. Free software users got extended application support, privacy-caring users can reduce or monitor data that is sent to Google and especially older phones can expect some battery life improvements. <a href="/activities/android/liberate.html#F-Droid">Read more about MicroG</a> on our Free Your Android Pages.</p>

  <h3>Be brave! Be a good user!</h3>

  <p>This page could only glimpse on the possibilities and the benefits of using Free Software on your device. It brings back control to you over your data, your software and over the lifetime of your device. If you like to install Free Software on your device now on your own you will find a lot of information on the Internet.
