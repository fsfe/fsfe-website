<h1>Apple vs EU Commission: the FSFE intervenes to safeguard Free Software</h1>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is intervening in litigation 
brought by Apple against the European Commission before the Court of 
Justice of the European Union. Apple is seeking to avoid DMA obligations 
related to its App Store and the interoperability of its operating 
system. The FSFE aims to protect Free Software against monopolistic 
corporate control.</p>

<p>The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has officially 
allowed the FSFE to intervene in the litigation brought by <a 
href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=289266&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=901367">">Apple 
against the European Commission</a> to avoid being designated as a 
‘gatekeeper’ under <a href="/activities/dma/dma.html">the Digital 
Markets Act (DMA)</a>. The company has put 
forward an aggressive policy against Software Freedom and 
interoperability, seeking to deter the enforcement of the DMA – a law 
dedicated to increase fairness and contestability in digital markets by 
regulating the economic behaviour of very large tech corporations.</p>

<p> </p><blockquote>
“Becoming an intervener in this case is crucial as the FSFE is 
representing the civil society perspective, which enriches the judicial 
proceedings. This allows the court to make fully informed decisions”, 
says Dr. Martin Husovec, the lawyer representing FSFE in the court.
</blockquote> <p></p>
 

<p>
The FSFE’s intervention aims to uphold the application of the DMA to 
Apple, <a href="/news/2024/news-20240627-01.html">leveraging the voice 
of the Free Software community</a> against the 
company’s unfair practices. Free Software projects are 
<a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/device-neutrality/202404-FSFE-apple-report-EC.pdf">disproportionately 
affected</a> by the company’s monopolistic practices. 
Apple’s fee policies, strict vendor lock-in, prohibition on 
side-loading, and restriction on alternative app stores result in 
insurmountable barriers against Software Freedom.
</p>

<p>
</p><blockquote>
“Standing against a corporate giant like Apple, which has billions of 
euros to hinder Software Freedom, reflects the FSFE's commitment to 
preserving open and competitive digital environments. The FSFE's 
intervention is fundamental  for <a 
href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index">Device Neutrality</a>, 
ensuring that users 
and developers are not locked into proprietary systems and can freely 
choose and use the software they want. The court's acceptance of the FSFE's 
application underlines the importance of Free Software and 
interoperability not only for digital markets, but also for user 
freedoms, open internet and digital democracy”, states Lucas Lasota, 
FSFE’s Legal Programme Manager.
</blockquote> 
<p></p>

<p>In accepting the FSFE into the proceedings, <a 
href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=289266&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=901367">the
              court stated</a> that “<i>the case is likely to have a
              significant impact on […] the supply of Free Software,
              free exchange of information and equal chances in
              accessing software</i>”. Besides, the court recognized
            that, in case Commissions’ designation decision would be
            annulled, [...] “<i>such a result would have an impact on
              the ability of the developers of applications or Free
              Software to interconnect their applications free of charge
              with Apple’s operating system iOS, which, in turn, would
              affect [the] FSFE’s ability to further and distribute such
              software to as wide a public as possible</i>”. </p> 

<p>The next step for the FSFE is to submit its arguments by mid-September. 
Further updates will be posted on <a href="/">fsfe.org</a>.</p>
