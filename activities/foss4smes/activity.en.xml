    <description>
      FOSS4SMEs was a two years collaborative Erasmus+ project. The
      FSFE worked together with five organisations with different
      geographical and work backgrounds to spread and extend the
      knowledge about Free Software. To reach this objective, the
      project developed free online educational resources for managers
      and staff of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
