    <title>I love Free Software Festival in Manchester, United Kingdom</title>
    <body>
     The local group of FSFE Manchester is running a week-long "I love Free Software" Festival, beginning from February 3rd until February 8. While the whole festival is about Free Software, each evening focusses on a specific topic: Bitcoin, Wordpress, Cryptoparty and Free Your Android. The events take place in the Madlab, Manchester. Participation is free of charge and it is a great possibility to meet friends and other likeminded people.
