<p>In 2023, Software Freedom has been back on stage, while we have boosted 
our activities for the coming generations with our children's book and 
the coding competition for young Europeans. We have also continued to 
bring our demands to lawmakers, helped project to become REUSE 
compliant and we have shared many great moments with our community.</p>

<div id="introduction">
<p>
  “Software Freedom in Europe” is the yearly report of the Free 
  Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), your charity organisation which 
  empowers people to control technology. Every year we refine our 
  manifold activities to address the current needs of software freedom 
  in Europe.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong>40 Years of Software Freedom!</strong> The 40th anniversary of the launch of the 
GNU Project, which marked the beginning of the software 
freedom movement, has led us to look back at all that we have achieved over 
the past four decades, but also at the challenges that lie ahead in the 
years to come.</p>

<p>Since the 1980s, technology has become an increasingly 
important part of our lives: we use devices at home to make our daily 
tasks easier, most of us use a laptop at work, we use technology in our 
leisure time (playing, travelling...). And this year, Artificial 
Intelligence has jumped in in a lot of our debates as it has been a hot 
topic in the public sphere.</p>

<p>Our movement has become global and broad  and that includes 
small local companies, large global corporations, civil society 
organisations and thousands of professionals. We are all working 
towards a world where the <a 
href="/freesoftware/index.html#freedoms">four freedoms</a> are 
guaranteed: users are free 
to use software and adapt it to their needs, and are able to understand 
and share it. These rights support other fundamental rights such as 
freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and privacy.</p> 

<p>However, just like 40 years ago, we still need trustworthy systems that put the end 
user in control. The last technology developments are showing that this 
is more important than ever: in the era of the Artificial Intelligence 
we need to remember to keep people’s rights at the top. In a 
world that communicates using social media, we need decentralized and 
federated networks that are not controlled by an autocratic individual. 
In a time in which we are surrounded by devices, we need not only be 
able to use them, but also to understand them and to improve them while 
adapt them to our necessities and needs.</p>

<p>In this scenario, we need to empower our new generations. They are the 
first generation that, since birth, have 
24/7 access to the internet, connected devices and social media 
networks. Therefore, their level of comfort with technology is quite 
high. However,
to build a democratic, transparent and trustworthy society that relies 
more and more on our technological developments, our children also need to 
understand, tinker and experiment with technology.</p>

<p>The history of humanity has been written through creativity, diversity and collaboration. 
Tinkering, first with our hands and now with technology, has helped us 
to evolve, to learn from our mistakes and from the experience and 
knowledge of others.  Let's give our current and future generations the 
right to do the same. Let's give them the power to control our 
technology and theirs. Why show them that there is only vanilla when we 
have endless flavours?</p>

<p>
  Our Software Freedom in Europe 2023 report covers the FSFE activities from 
  November 2021 to August 2022. We hope it gives you a better 
  understanding of our daily work and that you enjoy reading it!</p>

<h2>Ada &amp; Zangemann: a story that travels the world</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>
	“I loved the book; I found the theme very important and 
	interesting, and the message delighted me (first the 
	resourcefulness of Ada, then the demonstration which unites the 
	whole city, and finally the Parliament which learns from its 
	mistakes). This book is exactly what I want to pass on to my 
	children!”
  </p>
  <cite>Canelle A., 18-year-old student translator in a Parisian high school</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>The illustrated book <a href="/activities/ada-zangemann/index.html">'Ada 
&amp; Zangemann - A Tale of Software, 
Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream'</a> by the FSFE, tells the story of 
the famous inventor Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada 
begins to experiment with hardware and software, and in the process 
realises how crucial it is for her and others to control technology.</p> 

<p>The book is currently available in German and, for the last months, also <a href="/news/2023/news-20230831-01.html">
in English</a>. However, thanks to 
lots of volunteers, Ada &amp; Zangemann is also translated into other 
languages such as French, Italian, Danish or Valencian. In the <a 
href="/activities/ada-zangemann/index.html">book git 
repository</a>, these community translations and other resources can be 
found.</p> 

<blockquote>
  <p>
  "The youth at the Elizabeth Peabody House enjoyed the reading of 
  Ada &amp; Zangemann. It was a fun and engaging read; vivid illustrations, 
  colors, and details on each page kept them excited for what came next. 
  The youth could relate to Ada, as they are full of great, creative 
  ideas; that they hope to bring to life too" 
  </p>
  <cite>Matthew Caughey, Executive Director, The Elizabeth Peabody House</cite>
</blockquote>  
  
<p>During these past months, the story of Ada &amp; Zangemann have also been spread through readings. More 
than 900 people have already participate in one of these event in 
Germany, Italy, Belgium, and the US.  Started by the author, Matthias 
Kirschner, the readings are currently ongoing by other 
FSFE staff and volunteers! For example, Bonnie Mehring read it at 
CCCamp, Dario Presutti in Italy to celebrate the Software Freedom Day 
and the volunteer Isabel Drost-Fromm read it, with the help of her 
child, at FrOSCon.</p>

  </figure>



<p>Ada went overseas to <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/6brjbMKJMKkQ5f1jktkhaa">LibrePlanet, the 
annual conference of the FSF</a>, and we found out that she made it to <a href="https://unstructured.studio/blog/a-storytelling-session-about-software-and-ice-cream-in-rural-rajasthan/">
rural Rajasthan</a>, and to a school at a hospital in Middle East, where 
impaired children from that region realized a small detailed that most 
readers might have missed: <a 
href="https://k7r.eu/importance-of-more-inclusive-illustrations/">Ada 
&amp; Zangemann is cares about inclusiveness</a>. One of the book 
illustrations is showing a girl with a 3D printed leg. Did you notice 
it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  "I read this book to my 6-year old child who was drawn by the beautiful illustrations and couldn’t 
  wait to hear the story. It’s been the start of a much-needed 
  conversation on out-of-the-box thinking, digital freedom, and 
  contesting power in the age of surveillance." 
  </p>
  <cite>Claire Fernandez, Executive Director, European Digital Rights (EDRi)</cite>

<p>Moreover Matthias Kirschner was invited to participate in different 
podcasts, to talk about the book and Free software:</p>

<p>Two years ago the FSFE launched the first round of the <a href="/activities/yh4f/index.html">Youth Hacking 
4 Freedom (YH4F)</a> coding contest. YH4F is an initiative aiming to raise 
awareness for Free Software among the younger generation. This 
competition encourages teenagers to tinker and experiment with 
technology. It gives participants the chance to discuss and network 
with important people in the field of computer science and Free 
Software. The winners are rewarded with a trip to Brussels and a cash 
prize, which could be an investment for their own project. Take a look 
at Bonnie Mehring’s <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/ibNDS7ojB7eHpenrXS835d%20">talk 
explaining the YH4F competition at the 
Augsburger Linux-Infotag 2023</a> (in German 🇩🇪).</p> 

<p>After the successful conclusion of the first round in 2022, the FSFE 
organised the second round, which began at the start of this year.</p>

<p><strong>First edition:</strong> The winners of the first edition had 
the chance to spend a joyful time in Brussels, where the awards 
ceremony took place. The weekend was summarised in a <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/wWUP7M5fJg2FcvG2Fv12sN
">short video</a> and this year we have published <a 
href="/tags/tagged-yh4f-project.html">interviews with the 
participants</a> to learn 
more about their background and developed projects.</p>

<p><strong>Second edition:</strong> the winners of the 2023 edition 
were announced at the Award Ceremony, held in Brussels in the middle of 
October.During the next months, we will be publishing interviews with 
the participants about their projects. So <strong>stay tuned</strong>!</p> 

<h2>‘Public Money? Public Code!: simple, right?</h2> 

<p><a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Software made with public money should 
be released as Free Software</a>. Simple and clear, right? 
During the last months we have continued our activities to raise 
awareness about this initiative and explaining why this is 
important.</p>

  </figure>


<p><strong>Free Software in German municipalities:</strong> In January, we hosted an 
online event on Free Software in Dortmund, Germany, with the 
participation of the local government and more than 160 other community 
representatives. Under the title <a 
href="/news/2022/news-20221215-02.html">"Municipalities need Free 
Software"</a> 
the participants were informed about the developments leading to a 
newly founded OSPO in Dortmund, about "Public Money? Public Code!", 
Free Software as the key to digital sovereignty, and new perspectives 
for municipalities that want to use Free Software. The event, <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230119-01.html">that was 
recorded</a>, was organised in cooperation with Do-FOSS and OK.NRW.</p>
 
<p>As a result of the event, FSFE invited all participants and other persons 
from municipal administrations to join our <a 
href="mailto:fs-kommunen@lists.fsfe.org">new mailing list on the 
topic</a> of Free Software in German municipalities, with currently more 
than 200 subscribers.</p> 

<p>
<strong>A German “Sovereign Workplace” for public 
administrations:</strong> The current German government is working on a 
sovereign workplace, a Free Software office and collaboration suite for 
the public sector, as one of the projects to fulfil the goals of the 
coalition agreement. However, <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230606-01.html">a closer look at the project 
raises 
questions</a> such as: Where is the source code? Who is responsible for it? 
What happens to the public money involved? We asked the German Federal 
Ministry of the Interior and Community (BMI) <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230920-01.html">and publicly analysed the 
answer</a>, criticising the German state-owned enterprise Dataport for 
open-washing its pseudo-sovereign product dPhoenixSuite.
</p> 

<p>If you are 
interested in this topic, check out Johannes Näder talk about it at 
FrOSCon: <a

Software for German administrations? Mysteries around 
the Souvereign Workplace”</a> (in German 🇩🇪).</p> 

<p>
<strong>Midterm evaluation of the German Government </strong>Moreover, 
the FSFE, together with an alliance of civil society, science 
institutions and the Free Software industry, released a call on the 
German government to <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230829-01.html">implement a sustainable digital 
policy and to 
provide the necessary funds in the federal budget</a>. We draw a negative 
mid-term balance for the digital policy of the German government and 
demand a change towards Free Software and Public Money? Public 
Code!
</p>

<p>
<strong>PMPC in Italy:</strong> <a href="/news/2022/news-20220531-01.html">Six  Public Money, Public Code! 
events have been held in Italy</a>, in six different cities: from the 
extreme north to the extreme south: Trento, Bologna, Caltanissetta, 
Milan, Bolzano, and Empoli. The events were conducted entirely by volunteers.
</p>

<p><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> Related to this topic  we got published an 
article on <a 
href="https://www.ifa.de/fileadmin/Content/docs/foerderungen/CCP_Programm/CCP_DigitalCivilSociety_Access-OpenTech.pdf">Free 
Software to control technology</a> (pages 
11-12[18-21]) (pdf) in “Access OpenTech" for the CrossCulture Programme 
(CCP) by ifa. You can also listen (in German 🇩🇪) to Johannes Näder 
explaining in the <a 
href="https://egovernment-podcast.com/egov139-fsfe-pmpc/">eGovernment-Podcast 
our initiative Public Money? 
Public code!</a> and why Free Software is important for administrations and 
their digital sovereignty. One episode of our Software Freedom Podcast also cover this topic with 
Petter Joelson, the director of Digidem Lab, who discuss with us 
<a href="/news/podcast/episode-17.html">citizen participation and the tool Decidm</a>.</p>

<p>Do not forget to support the Public Money, Public Code! Initiative 
by <a href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">signing its Open 
Letter</a>, <a href="/news/2022/news-20220823-01.html">sharing your 
picture</a>. in your social 
networks, talking about it to your local administrators.</p>

<h2>Liability, Interoperability and Free Software in the EU</h2> 
<p>Political decisions and directions have a big impact on Free Software, 
its ecosystems and its communities. The FSFE has long-time experience 
in working with policy-makers and public bodies in Europe, from local 
administrations to high-level decision makers. The FSFE aims at 
enhancing the rights of Free Software users and developers, working to 
abolish barriers to Free Software adoption.</p> 

<p>In the coming months, we expect to see the adoption of the following 
legislation in the EU: <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230824-01.html">Liability Act, AI Act, CRA and 
Interoperability 
Act</a>.</p>

<figure>
     <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/big/278c7c68effc3bb373e271be722e93ee.jpg"
       alt="An illustration about the four freedoms that allows Software Freedom"/>
      </figure>

<p>
<strong><italic>Liability / AI Act</italic></strong>: The EU is debated 
the introduction of liability rules for software, including Free 
Software. The relevant proposals are the AI Act, Product Liability 
	Directive (PLD), and Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). The way they  have 
	been proposed, all proposals would  harm the Free Software 
	ecosystem and thus the society and the economy. We therefore first 
	proposed changes in the AI Act to safeguard Free Software 
	developers, and also presented a similar position on the proposed 
	liability rules in CRA and PLD during a hearing in the European 
	Parliament. We propose, in the light of the CRA, <a href="/news/2023/news-20230719-01.html">a solution that 
	will lead to more security while safeguarding the Free Software 
	ecosystem</a>:
</p> 
   <ol> 
    <li>
    Liability should be shifted to those deploying Free Software instead 
    of those  developing Free Software and
    </li> 
	<li>
	Those who significantly financially benefit from this deployment should 
	make sure the software becomes CE-compliant.
	</li> 
	</ol>

<p>
<strong><italic>Interoperable Europe Act</italic></strong>: With the 
proposed Interoperable Europe Act, the EU is aiming to 
	create a dedicated legal framework on interoperability that will 
	enhance cross-border digital public services across the Union. 
	During this past year, <a href="/news/2023/news-20230323-02.html">the FSFE has been advocating for a more 
	inclusive governance structure in this legislation</a>, where different 
	stakeholders, including the Free Software community, can be part of 
	the Interoperable Europe Board. A proper monitoring workflow and 
	evaluation together with a dedicated budget are also part of our 
	demands.
</p> 
	
	<p>The EU Parliament has followed some of our demands by taking a 
	step forward towards a more inclusive Board while introducing 
	clearer indicators and statistics to monitor the progress of the 
	Act. On the other hand, the Council is going on the opposite 
	direction by hindering <a href="/news/2023/news-20230623-01.html">the 
	inclusion of relevant stakeholders in the 
	governance structure</a>. A final agreement by the three EU 
	Institutions is expected to be reached by the end of this year, and 
	here the FSFE is calling upon the European Parliament to safeguard 
	its position and not allow any backwards step.</p>
	
	<p>You can get a deep understanding of the Interoperable European Act by 
	listening to Lina Ceballos explaining <a href="/news/podcast/episode-21.html">why Free Software should be 
	considered and safeguarded in such EU legislation</a> in an episode of 
	our Software Freedom Podcast.</p>
    
    <figure>

       alt="European building with the European Parliament symbol"/>
       </figure>
    
<p></p> 
	<p><strong>EU Declaration of Digital Rights: </strong>Member states, the 
	European Parliament and the Commission have 
	reached a consensus on <a href="/news/2022/news-20221206-01.html">the Declaration of Digital Rights and 
	Principles</a>. Although it aims to serve as a reference point for the 
	digital transformation of Europe, it instead descends into murky 
	waters, causing ambiguity. Its wording is unclear and it overlooks 
	existing good proposals. The EU Parliament proposal had a clear 
	reference to Free Software as a way to ensure transparency in the 
	use of algorithms and artificial intelligence, as well as the 
	importance of Open Standards. Unfortunately, this wording failed to 
	be upheld during the inter-institutional negotiations, and the 
	final text ended up being rather unclear.</p> 
	
	<p>FSFE has also been working on the protection of open standards. 
	While Alexander Sander participated as a panellist in the Open 
	Standards and Industrial Use for Open Source workshop, part of the 
	<a 
	href="https://swforum.eu/os-standards">SWForum</a>, a few months 
	ago we responded to <a 
	href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13109-Intellectual-property-new-framework-for-standard-essential-patents/F3434433_en">the 
	EC Intellectual Property Consultation on a new framework for 
	standard-essential patents</a>.</p>

	<p>Moreover, FSFE’s co-founder and programmer Bernhard E. Reiter 
	explained <a href="/news/2022/news-20221026-02.html">why Free Software 
	supporters should join the protest against 
	the EU Chat control</a>, that deprives citizens of the privacy of digital 
	correspondence. And related to  AI, this year our volunteer Vincent 
	Lequertier published several interesting articles in Planet FSFE about 
	<a href="https://vl8r.eu/">ethics, Free Software, and AI</a>.</p>


<h2>Legal Support: helping projects and individuals</h2> 
	
<p>At the Free Software Foundation Europe we help answer licensing questions, provide 
technical support to make licensing easier (among others, with REUSE), 
provide legal education materials on Free Software, such as the videos 
from the Legal Education Day, and organise an annual conference for 
FSFE's legal network, the Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop 
(LLW). We are also part of several EU-funded projects, helping with 
legal concepts and issues.</p>

<h3>REUSE: making licensing easier</h3>

<p>FSFE's <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE project</a> aims to 
make licensing easy for people and machines alike. It solves one of the 
most common Free Software licensing problems: what kind of licence a 
file is licensed under, and who owns the copyright. REUSE provides 
simple recommendations in three steps to help users, developers, and 
legal professionals.</p> 

<p><strong>Reuse 3.0:</strong> In 2023 we release the REUSE Specification 3.0. This specification defines a 
standardized method for declaring copyright and licensing for software 
projects. The goal of the specification is to have unambiguous, human- 
and machine-readable copyright and licensing information for each 
individual file in a project. Ideally this information is embedded into 
every file, so that the information is preserved when the file is 
copied and reused by third parties.</p> 

<p>Several projects have adopted REUSE, <a 
href="/news/2022/news-20221219-01.html">being GNU Health one of the best 
known</a>. Since then, 
users and re-users of GNU Health have been able to have a clear 
overview of the copyright notices and licence terms thanks to the 
standardised way of displaying them by following the REUSE 
specification.</p>

  alt="Picture explaining how REUSE works" />
  </figure>
 
 
<p>At the end of 2022, and during this present year, we have presented the REUSE 
initiative at diverse conferences throughout Europe, such as SFSCON or 
FOSDEM. Our talk at the Weizenbaum Conference 2022 “Practicing 
Sovereignty – Interventions for Open Digital Futures” <a 
href="https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/media/Publikationen/Weizenbaum_Proceedings/Proceedings_Weizenbaum_Conference_2022.pdf">resulted 
in an 
academic article</a> (page 66-71) (pdf)  explaining how REUSE specifications 
facilitate and improve management policies for the digital commons by 
improving data and metadata communication for individuals, communities, 
governments, and businesses.</p>

<h3>Legal Education Day 2022</h3> <p>The FSFE organized a Legal 
 Education Day as part of the South Tyrol Free Software Conference 
 (SFSCON), which featured talks on legal topics relating to Free 
 Software, as well as a workshop to facilitate a better understanding of 
 these legal framework and compliances. Throughout the day, we explained 
 basic legal concepts such as copyright law, licensing, and their 
 practical applications into Free Software projects with the REUSE 
 specification.</p>

<p>As part of the conference, our talks at the Legal Education Day were 
also filmed, and we have added these videos to our <a

watch 
them at your own pace.</p>

<h3>Legal support, research, innovation and standardization: participation in EU projects</h3>

<p><strong>The ZOOOM Project:</strong> Since late 2022, FSFE has been a 
part of the <a href="https://zooom4u.eu/">ZOOOM Initiative</a>, a project financed 
by the European Commission. The primary goal of ZOOOM is to raise 
awareness among the academic, business, industry, and innovation 
communities of the importance of rights and obligations related to Free 
Software, Open Data, and Open Hardware.</p> 

<p>To accomplish this goal, the ZOOOM Initiative will develop a series 
of reports, white papers, training materials, and web portals to 
promote a solid understanding of licensing requirements and business 
needs aiming to reach the three key groups of actors in innovation 
ecosystems: namely knowledge generators, innovation support 
organizations, and key stakeholders.</p>

<p>As one out of ten organizations comprising the consortium that makes 
up the ZOOOM Initiative, FSFE is responsible for the promotion of our 
<a href="https://reuse.software">REUSE specification</a> as well as producing 
educational materials on the fundamental legal concepts of Free 
Software and licensing.</p>

  alt="ZOOOM project logo" />
  </figure>

<p>Our work on ZOOOM has been progressing 
well, and we have contributed with chapters to the various papers explaining 
the basics of Free Software, including elementary Free Software legal 
and licensing issues. In particular, we have also compiled a chapter on 
Free Software licensing issues related specifically to Artificial 
Intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>We will keep you updated on when we will publicly 
share these materials as we are currently awaiting their final 
publication, so stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>Next Generation Internet Zero:</strong> Since 2018, FSFE has 
been involved in the <a href="/activities/ngi/ngi.html">Next Generation 
Internet Zero (NGI0) initiative</a> as a consortium member. Funded by 
the European Commission, the <a 
href="https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ngi-zero/">NGI0 initiative</a> 
hopes to support the 
development of the internet into <a 
href="/news/nl/news/2023/news-20230425-01.html">a platform that is 
accessible and 
diverse, and that respects fundamental rights</a>, including values such as 
privacy, which is also referred to as the Next Generation Internet. At 
the FSFE, we believe that Free Software is key to accomplish this goal, 
so that all users are able to use the internet as an effective tool to 
achieve their full potential.</p>

<p>NGI0 projects provide financial grants and technical support to 
researchers and developers who are working on Free Software solutions 
that contribute to the establishment of the vision of the Next 
Generation Internet.</p>

  </figure>



<p>After completing <a href="/activities/ngi/ngi-past.tml">our previous 
NGI0 projects in 2022</a>, we have for the past year been working on our 
current NGI0 projects: <a href="https://nlnet.nl/entrust">NGI0 
Entrust</a>, <a href="https://nlnet.nl/core">NGI0 Core</a>, and <a 
href="https://nlnet.nl/NGI0/review/">NGI0 Review</a>.</p>
      
<p>As we’ve always done with our previous NGI0 projects, we have been 
assisting the software projects receiving grants from these various 
NGI0 projects with their legal and licensing needs, as well as helping 
them in their transitions when adopting our <a href="https://reuse.software">REUSE specification</a>.</p>
   
<p>We continued our work with NGI0 this year by helping many developers 
working on Free Software solutions solve a diverse range of problems, 
as well as helping them have a better understanding of Free Software 
licenses, compliance issues, and how they can avoid some of these 
pitfalls by adopting our REUSE specification.</p>

<h3>Legal Network and LLW 23</h3> 

<p>In 2023, FSFE successfully organized our first Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop (LLW) as 
an in-person event again, after a 3-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 
pandemic.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/original/78/ce/61cb6009a4693e909d4b14f88dd7.jpg"
  alt="Picture showing some material from LLW 2023" />
  </figure>


<p>The LLW is organized every year by the FSFE to allow legal experts 
in the <a href="/activities/ln/ln.html">FSFE’s Legal Network</a> to 
discuss legal issues and best practices surrounding Free Software 
licenses. This event has become one of the foremost gathering  of 
lawyers, technologists, and thought leaders on Free Software legal and 
licensing topics. This event is usually an important opportunity that 
the FSFE provides to the legal community to share knowledge and updates 
on the topics that they are working on, in order to foster a better 
license compliance ecosystem by spreading best practices in the legal 
sphere. Additionally, the LLW provides a forum for legal professionals 
to better understand one another, which reduces overall friction in the 
sector. This year’s LLW was held in April in Gothenburg, Sweden. Over 
the course of three days, our 100 guests discussed software licensing 
issues relating to AI, process issues in license curation at the Open 
Source Initiative (OSI), and updates on legal cases involving Free 
Software licenses.</p>

<p>The last weeks of 2022 also left us some good news! Copyleft-licensed

<h2>TEDective: making European public procurement data explorable</h2> 

<p><a href="https://tedective.org/">TEDective</a> is making European public procurement 
data explorable for non-experts. Using open data this Free Software 
program empowers citizens by making EU tendering data accessible to 
everyone who wants to consult and use it. For example, it will allow a 
journalist to find out how much money the government spends on 
Microsoft licenses and products, but also to compare that spending with 
other regions in similar cases or even in comparison with other 
countries.</p>

  alt="Picture showing two members of the TEDEctive team posing with a big check"/>
  </figure>



<p>‘TEDective’ <a href="/news/2022/news-20221026-01.html">won last year the 
first prize</a> in ‘transparency in public procurement’ challenge in the 
EU Datathon.</p>

<p>Developed with the help of Michael Weimann, and released as a 
REUSE-compliant project under a Free Software (also known as Open 
Source) license, TEDective improves access to the data published by 
Tenders Electronic Daily (TED), fulfilling all of the following 
requirements with regards to the provision of TED data: it is available 
without costs for commercial as well as non-commercial use; it is 
up-to-date (updates at least on a monthly basis), cleaned and both 
buyers and suppliers are adequately deduplicated; and it can be 
downloaded in bulk, making it available as Open Contracting Data 
Standard (OCDS) to allow interoperability. Besides, it will be 
designed, maintained and monitored transparently and in close 
co-operation with all relevant stakeholders and user groups.</p>

<p>In 2023, we will further work on developing this tool and we are 
looking for contributors who want to get involved. Get in touch via 
<email>tedective@fsfe.org</email> if you're interested!</p>

<h2>Device Neutrality: taking control of devices</h2>

<p>We started the Device Neutrality initiative to raise awareness about 
the increasing loss of end-user control over technology. In our 
increasingly technology-dependent societies, <a 
href="/activities/deviceneutrality/index">Device Neutrality</a> aims to 
put control back in the hands of end users, allowing them to bypass 
gatekeepers and use Free Software on their devices in a 
non-discriminatory way.</p>
 
<p>2022 ended with the important step of <a 
href="/news/2022/news-20221206-01.html">the adoption of the Digital 
Markets Act</a> by the European Parliament. This legislation introduces the 
principle of Device Neutrality, although it does not envisage setting 
open standards as the default for defining interoperability.</p>

<p>In 2023 we have continue our efforts to bring Device Neutrality into 
the European legislation. We have also deepen this concept with in a 
<a href="/news/podcast/episode-20.html">podcast episode</a> and worked 
in creating an specific landing page for 
this topic and of course, we have continue trying to achieve Router 
Freedom in Europe and with our Upcycling Android campaign.</p>

<h3>Router Freedom: a EU demand</h3>
<p>Router Freedom is the right of customers of an Internet 
Service Provider (ISP) to choose and use a private router instead of a 
router that the ISP forces them to use. But some Internet service 
providers in Europe dishonour this principle by dictating which device 
their customers have to use in order to connect to the internet, or 
they discriminate against the owners of alternative devices. This 
undermining of our basic freedom of choice is strongly opposed by the 
Free Software Foundation Europe and many other organisations, projects, 
and individuals. <a href="/activities/routers/routers.html">Router 
Freedom</a> is not merely a topic for experts. It 
affects all of us.</p>

<ul>
	<li>EU Survey: more than a thousand consumers from across Europe 
	have shared their experience of the commercial practices of 
	Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in <a 
	href="/news/2023/news-20230515-02.html">our pan- European survey</a> 
	regarding freedom of terminal equipment, resulting in <a 
	href="/news/2023/news-20230515-01.html">a call for 
	Router Freedom</a>.</li>
	
	<li>Router Freedom as priority for the future 
	of Net Neutrality regulation: the EU Commission has published <a 
	href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/e1f1154f-ee2f-11ed-a05c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-285823692">a 
	study on the future of Net Neutrality regulation</a>, confirming Router 
	Freedom as a priority for the future implementation of Open 
	Internet in Europe. (Recommendation 2, p. 91). The study referred 
	to work done by the FSFE (p.11), supporting the conclusions we at 
	the FSFE have been advocating in recent years. In particular, 
	national regulators should prioritize end-users’ rights and 
	safeguard freedom of terminal equipment for all network types, 
	including fiber (FTTH).</li>
	
	<li>Our staff and volunteers have been working to bring Rotuer Freedom into the national levels  Thanks to 
	their efforts, <a href="/news/2022/news-20221215-01.html">Belgium is 
	working to ensure Router Freedom</a> and 
	<a href="/news/2022/news-20221215-01.html">Greece is also securing 
	Router Freedom</a> although it is excluding 
	fiber connections. However there is still a long way to go as for 
	example <a href="/news/2023/news-20230915-01.html">in Germany, telcos want to exclude fiber from Router 
	Freedom</a>, which goes against the German law and the EU regulatory 
	framework of net neutrality.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Upcyling Android: free your device and “become greener”</h3>

  alt="Upcycling Android logo"/>
  </figure>


<p>“Upcyling Android" is the name of an initiative that the FSFE has 
been running for the last years and that officially finished in March 
2023. Launched in November 2021, this initiative helps people to flash 
their phones with Free Software operating systems and promotes the 
right for every user to install any software on any device. Moreover, 
upcycling our devices is an important step to rethink our short-term, 
linear consumption of electronic devices in favour of a circular 
economy.</p>

<p>The initiative offered workshops, develops policy recommendations, 
and received a lot of attention:</p>

<ul>
	<li> <p><strong>Workshops:</strong> A total of 12 workshops were 
	organised by FSFE, consisting of a short introduction, a joint 
	flashing of phones with a question and answer session, followed by 
	individual flashing of phones, and ending with tips and tricks for 
	further use of Free Software on mobile phones with F-Droid and 
	microG.</p> 
	<p>Some of the workshops were held at international 
	conferences (Bolzano), some in public spaces and libraries (Bonn, 
	Berlin), in a university environment (HAW Hamburg), in a local 
	hackerspace (Frankfurt, Berlin) or a Repair Café 
	*Korschenbroich-Herrenshoff) and even at the Federal Environment 
	Agency.</p> 
	<p>Besides, an online “Train the Trainers” workshop was 
	held to teach people about how to organize their own workshops.</p>
     </li>

  alt="Illustration with the words Free Software and a phone with a screen going out the phone with more illustrations about Free Software"/>
  </figure>
    
	<li> <p><strong>Information and background material:</strong> 
	throughout the campaign, the FSFE has created different resources 
	(poster, infographic, stickers, flyers, brochure, video...), 
	published under Creative Commons licences and in digital form on 
	the initiative website. Therefore, even if the project has ended, 
	this material can be used freely by others how want to continue 
	promoting  the use of Free Software while overcoming software 
	obsolescence and extending the lifespan of our hardware.</p> 
	
	<p>In addition, technical documentation, among it videos showing how to 
	flash different terminals,  was created to enable the workshops 
	offered to be reproduced independently during and after the end of 
	the project.</p> 
	</li>
     
	<li>
	<p><strong>Open Letter:</strong> to Legislators in the 
	European Union about "The universal right to install any software 
	on any device". Part of this initiative is this Open Letter that 
	covers four core demands enabling a more sustainable use of 
	electronic products and devices in the European Union. It has 
	already been signed by more than 150 civil society organisations 
	from different sectors as well as more than 3000 individuals. The 
	signatory organisations in particular ensure further virality of 
	the campaign in their own target groups.</p> 
     </li>

  alt="Upcycling Android flyer"/>
  </figure>
    
	<li> 
	<p><strong>Outreach:</strong> throughout the initiative, 
	outreach was done through press releases, news articles, social 
	media posts using the hashtag #UpcyclingAndroid, podcasts and 
	various presentations at various international conferences (such as 
	xxxx). The material we have produced has helped us to reach 
	different audiences, and our volunteers and civil society 
	organisations have also picked up on our messages. Thank you for 
	spreading the word.</p> 
	
	<p>The book ‘Shaping Digital Transformation 
	for a sustainable society’, published this year, is a collection of 
	28 papers from the second Bits &amp; Trees conference on digitalisation 
	and sustainability. In a chapter entitled 'Making the telecom 
	sector more sustainable with Free Software', Lucas Lasota and Erik 
	Albers explain how Free Software is key to a more sustainable 
	telecom sector by giving end-users more control over devices, 
	especially with regard to artificial obsolescence of software and 
	hardware.</p> 
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This initiative officially ended but there is still a lot to be 
done. You can continue showing the benefits of freeing your devices, by 
organizing a workshop, signing the Open Letter… All the documentation, 
information and material is there. And remember, rooting your device 
does not void its warranty.</p>

<h2>Our work on public awareness</h2>

<h3>I Love Free Software Day: Meet &amp; Connect</h3>

<p>One more year, the FSFE has celebrated our devotion for Free 
Software on the annual “I Love Free Software Day” on the 14th of 
February.</p>

<p>This year, we celebrated it with Free Software enthusiasts through <a 
href="/activities/ilovefs/report/report_2023.html">various events 
across Europe</a> (Berlin, Madrid, Thessaloniki, 
Potteries, Zurich, Frankfurt, Barcelona, online in Italy). For the 
first time, FSFE's women's group participated by organising a meeting.  
Besides the FSFE, many other organisations and individuals joined us, 
publicly showing their love for Free Software and appreciation for all 
the wonderful contributors without whom Free Software would not be 
possible. ❤️ Thank you!</p>

     </figure>
  


<p>Apart from all the events and activities on the day itself, we also 
have <a href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#ilovefs">new postcards and stickers</a>. A lot of 
Free Software projects got a hand written thank you postcard, in which 
we expressed our gratitude for their continue and wonderful work for 
software freedom.</p>

<p>And we are already working on next years’ celebration so save the 
date: 'I Love Free Software Day 2024: start software freedom' will take 
place on the 14th of February 2024.</p>


<h3>Software Freedom Podcast</h3>

<p>The FSFE’s Software Freedom Podcast has continued throughout the year, with  6 new episodes.</p>


<p>This year the podcast covered topics such as European politics, 
Device Neutrality, the importance of Free Software in medical devices, 
cryptography and privacy and Free software in France.</p>

<h3>Free Software and Federated social networks</h3>

<p>The FSFE is active in Peertube and in Mastodon. We created our own 
Peertube instance, media.fsfe.org, to share our videos on a Free 
Software platform and we have currently about 776  subscribers.</p>

<p>Our presence in Mastodon has also grown, having currently more than 
12700 followers! It is also great to see how more and more people and 
organizations are joining these and other decentralised social networks 
Fedigov: The FSFE Swiss local group launched, with GNU/Linux.ch, an 
initiative to encourage public institutions to use federated Free 
Software solutions to communicate with their people. FediGov is the 
name of this campaign that is also moving people to ask their 
governments to adopt ethical communications.</p>

<p><strong>Fediverse Education Day:</strong> The FSFE, the Centre for 
Civic Education of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the Adult 
Education Centre Cologne organised a public symposium on the Fediverse, 
its functionalities, its potentials and ways to use it for public 
institutions and administrations. Over 70 guests attended the 
event.</p>

<h3>‘What is Free Software’ Video</h3>

<p>We continued spreading the word with our What is Free Software 
video.  The video was released last year so we focused in spreading the 
word about it as well as to translate it into more languages. Thanks to 
our translators and a fundraising campaign we have the video currently 
in several european languages: Albanian, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, 
Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish:</p>

<h2>Back to the stages, the booths, and “the hugs”!</h2> 
<p>The last  months of 2022 put us again on the stages after the last years of 
 online conferences. We couldn’t be happier to be able to hug old faces 
 and to finally meet in person newcomers.  Our team has participated in 
 different and diverse conferences, so giving talks so with FSFE 
 booths.</p>

<p>Our “season” started with SFScon in Bolzano, where we enjoyed not 
only a fruitful conference with our second Legal Education Day, the 
first Italian community  meeting and a lot of interesting talks but 
also fun and networking time, such as our well known pizza evening.</p>

<p>At the beginning of February, we travelled to Brussels to FOSDEM!  
We were really glad to see so many of you there! Our booth was really 
busy with people wanting to learn a bit more about us, participants who 
heard our colleagues talked and wanted more information, and a lot of 
old friends just stopping to say hello. Check out  <a href="/news/2023/news-20230227-01.html">our talks at 
FOSDEM 2023</a> as well as the videos from the Legal &amp; Policy Devroom, 
co-hosted by us.</p>

<p>The spring found us attending foss-north, where we co-organized -for 
the first time!- a <a href="/news/2023/news-20230509-01.html">track on 
political, social, and legal issues</a> around 
Free Software</p> 

<figure>

  alt="European map with the name of the city and the event we attended in these past twelve months"/>
   <figcaption>Map showing the different events that we have around Europe</figcaption>
  </figure>
  

<p>All these events would have not been possible without the help of 
our community! The backbone of the Free Software Foundation Europe's 
work is its active network of Free Software advocates and volunteers, who 
contribute to the promotion and spreading of the benefits of Free 
Software within Europe. Your contribution and commitment allow us to 
continue running our campaigns, lending a hand to our team during our 
events and helping setting up a booth.</p>

<p>
Our local groups were meeting throughout these months: some of them went 
back to in person meetings, others have continue with online ones, and 
others are mixing it and we even have new communication channels... Any 
option is good to engange in fruitful dicussions, deepen in some 
conecpets and ideas, meet othrers with your same interests and even 
geting active with the development of new activities.
</p>

<p>Our translators team has done an exceptional job. 
In this last twelve months, we have added <strong>340 new translations</strong> to our 
website! And we have around 318 new pages in English!</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/a2/fa/888c917afd44f616aaa34407e1c1.JPG"
  alt="Summer meeting group picture"/>
  </figure>

<p>This year we also started online coordinators’ meeting. The aim of these 
meetings is to discuss with coordinators’ different topics and learn 
from each other experiences. The meetings are also a tool to network 
with coordinators from other countries.</p>

<p>But this year we alson wanted to spend time with our volunteers in a more 
relaxing environment and to be able to thank you, in person, all your 
contributions. The Linux Hotel hosted us for a Summer meeting weekend 
event in which we shared information about our current activities and 
campaigns, we learned from our our volunteers experience and knowledge 
and we really had a fun time!</p>
