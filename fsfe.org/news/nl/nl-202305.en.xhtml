<h3 id="FOSS-North-and-LLW-in-Gothenburg">FOSS-North and LLW in Gothenburg</h3>

<p>The Swedish city of Gothenburg hosted the <a href="/news/2023/news-20230428-01.html">2023 edition of the Free 
Software Legal &amp; Licensing Workshop (LLW)</a>, the annual conference for 
the Legal Network community. A few days later, FOSS-North took place, 
the conference in Gothenburg that brings together the Nordic Free 
Software communities. The FSFE organised a track on political and legal 
aspects of Free Software and also participated in the community day 
that preceded the conference.
</p>

<p>During FOSS-North, over 180 participants took the opportunity to 
learn about and discuss Free Software in more than 20 sessions. FSFE's 
Policy Project Manager Lina Ceballos gave a keynote speech about the 
Interoperable Europe Act and its possible impact on the Free Software 
community. </p>
<p>üì∫ The recordings of the sessions will be available on 
<a href="https://media.fsfe.org">the FSFE Peertube channel</a> soon, so stay tuned!

<h3 id="The-FSFE-is-helping-to-build-an-Internet-of-Humans">The FSFE is 
helping to build an ‚ÄúInternet of Humans‚Äù</h3> 

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is a partner of the Next Generation Internet Zero 
consortium, which aims to build a more resilient, trustworthy, and open 
Internet that empowers end users to control technology. The FSFE team 
provides support to NGI0 grantee projects on legal and licensing 
issues. In addition, the FSFE helps them become REUSE compliant.

<h3 id="Lithuania-Students-stop-university-from-using-only-proprietary-authentication">Lithuania: 
Students stop university from using only proprietary 
authentication</h3> 

<p>Vilnius Tech officials attempted to enforce the use of 
proprietary two factor identification (2FA) methods. Some students were 
concerned the methods would compromise privacy and could not be run in 
their devices, so they proposed an alternative authentication method. 
Eventually, the university reversed its decision.

<h3 id="SFP20-All-about-Device-Neutrality-with-Lucas-Lasota">SFP#20: 
All about Device Neutrality with Lucas Lasota</h3> 

<p>Although digital devices are all around us, the number of devices 
that cannot run Free Software is growing, with smartphones, PCs, and 
routers being particularly problematic. In this episode, Lucas Lasota 
joins Bonnie Mehring to discuss Device Neutrality and Router Freedom. 
Lucas explains how software freedom, the absence of vendor lock-in, and 
end-user control over data are crucial to breaking monopolies in 
digital markets, promoting an open Internet, and ensuring access to 
Free Software in devices. </p>

<p>Last year, the FSFE presented the REUSE initiative at the Weizenbaum 
Conference 2022 ‚ÄúPracticing Sovereignty ‚Äì Interventions for Open 
Digital Futures‚Äù. The presentation resulted in an <a 
href="https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/media/Publikationen/Weizenbaum_Proceedings/Proceedings_Weizenbaum_Conference_2022.pdf">academic 
article</a> (EN, page 66-71) explaining how REUSE specifications 
facilitate and improve management policies for the digital commons by 
improving data and metadata communication for individuals, communities, 
governments, and businesses.</p>

<h3 id="Listen-or-watch-Ada-and-Zangemann-book">Listen or watch - Ada 
&amp; Zangemann book</h3> 

<p> You can now get your copy of Ada &amp; 
Zangemann in English or German. While you can simply order the German 
edition <a 
href="https://oreilly.de/produkt/ada-und-zangemann/?ref=10022">online 
or at your favourite book store</a>, the English version is currently 
available in the US from the publisher and at the FSF online store and can 
be pre-ordered in the rest of the world. One more reason to pre-order 
it? It helps to support a book under a Creative Commons Share-alike 
license. </p>

  <p>
    "I'm a Free Software supporter for a long time, I fought against software patents in 
Brussels, co-organised the system theme at the Libre Software Meeting 
(RMLL) and run a Free Software company. Free Software is an essential 
part of our global freedom, so it was natural to become a supporter of 
the FSFE."
