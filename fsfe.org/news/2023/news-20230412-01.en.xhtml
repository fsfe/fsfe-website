<p>This year's <a href="https://foss-north.se/#">foss-north</a> will take place on April 24 and 25, following 
a community day on April 23. It will be a local, face-to-face event. 
While in the past foss-north has focused on the technical aspects of Free 
Software, this year there will also be room for presenting political, 
legal, and social issues related to software freedom.
</p>


<h3>Join the Conversation</h3>

<p>The FSFE is co-organising a track on political, social, and legal issues around Free Software in the Palmstedt Room.
</p>

<p>It will be two days full of interesting topics such as license 
compliance with AI assisted coding, municipal collaboration on Free 
Software, enabling Free Software through procurement projects, the role 
of Free Software for citizen participation, and more. Lina Ceballos, 
Policy Project Manager at the FSFE, will present our position on the 
Interoperable Europe Act in a keynote.
