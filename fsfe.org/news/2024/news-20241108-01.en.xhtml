“This year’s European SFS Award goes to Bram Moolenaar whose mantra was 
‘Detect inefficiencies, find a quicker way, make it a habit’, someone 
for whom efficiency of computers users was crucial. His work transformed 
how many interact with computers, maximizing programmers productivity by 
minimizing unnecessary keystrokes. His tool has become invaluable for 
Free Software contributors, developers, and creators.” said Matthias 
Kirschner, president of the FSFE as he presented the 2024 European SFS 
Award during SFSCON 24.
</p>  

<p>Bram Moolenaar is best known for developing <a href="https://www.vim.org/">VIM</a>, a powerful, screen-based text 
editor. Released in 1991, Vim was originally a port of the Stevie editor 
for Amiga and has since become an indispensable tool for developers 
worldwide, available across multiple platforms. Vim remains one of the 
most popular and versatile development environments, supporting 
countless programmers and fostering a dedicated user community. 
Moolenaar released Vim as “charityware,” encouraging users to support 
children in the south of Uganda through <a href="https://www.iccf-holland.org/donate.html">charitable 
donations</a>.</p>

<p>
“Educating others to empower them was also important for Bram outside of 
the technology field”,  explained Raphael Barbieri, a member of LUGBZ, 
during the ceremony. “He helped children in Uganda, many of whom had 
lost their parents to HIV, gain access to education at the Kibaale 
Community Centre. He founded an NGO to collection donations for this 
work, even on his work desk there was a piggy bank so that visitors can 
easily donate.”
</p>

<p>
Beyond Vim, Moolenaar was a prolific contributor to the Free Software 
movement, having worked on numerous technical projects, created a 
programming language, and developed a tool to streamline software 
installation and management. He also held official roles within software 
organisations, amplifying his impact on the Free Software landscape.
</p>

<p>
This award commemorates Moolenaar’s unwavering dedication to help others 
to better understand computers and software. It gave him great pleasure 
to participate in conferences, explain the Free Software culture at his 
work place, and help others to develop and use his software. He wanted 
others to also experience this joy. "If you are happy, I am happy!" was 
one of his sayings. Moolenaar passed away on 3 August, 2023, due to a 
rapidly deteriorating illness. His legacy in the developer community and 
in social work is expected to continue.
</p>

<p>
In a message from Moolenaar's family, they expressed their pride and 
gratitude: "We are very proud that Bram received this award. As a 
dedicated supporter of Free Software, we believe he would have been 
honored to accept it. We thank the Free Software Foundation Europe and 
LUGBZ for recognizing Bram's lifelong work and encourage anyone wishing 
to honor him to support children in Uganda through <a href="https://www.iccf-holland.org/donate.html">ICCF Holland</a>."

<h2>The European SFS Award</h2>
<p>
The SFS Award was first presented in 2004 to Hugo Leiter at the SFSCON 
South Tyrol Free Software Conference in recognition of his work 
implementing LibreOffice across all municipalities in South Tyrol. In 
2023, the award expanded to a European level, with the Free Software 
Foundation Europe (FSFE) partnering with LUGBZ, the award’s initiator, 
to honor those who have made exceptional contributions to the promotion 
and dissemination of Free Software across Europe.
</p> 

<p>
The European SFS Award celebrates developers whose work has 
significantly advanced the accessibility and impact of Free Software in 
Europe. In 2023, the award was presented to Frank Karlitschek, founder 
of Nextcloud, for his contributions to Free Software.
</p>

<h2>2024 Laudatio</h2>
<p>
<strong>Matthias:</strong> It is an honor to present the European SFS 
Award 2024. The FSFE and LUGBZ worked together again this year to find a 
winner from all nominations. This year’s European SFS Award goes to 
someone whose work transformed how many interact with computers, 
creating a tool for Free Software contributors, developers, and 
creators. A tool that new users might be a little afraid of because it 
can be tricky to exit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Raphael:</strong> (Yes, you may know the software we’re talking 
about.) A piece of code that makes every keystroke feel like a power 
move, where “Esc” is the most important key on your keyboard. Since its 
launch in 1991, this software has spread across more than 15 operating 
systems and is installed on millions of computers around the world.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Matthias:</strong> For our winner, efficiency of computer users 
was crucial. His mantra was: “Detect inefficiencies, find a quicker way, 
make it a habit!” and he helped many people to how to actually 
accomplish this. He went on to help those he met on mailing lists, at 
conferences like SFSCON in 2009, or at his workplace. He even talked to 
public administrations, so they actually use and thereby benefit from 
Free Software. He wanted to ensure that all software which is procured 
by public administrations is published under a Free Software license for 
the good of society.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Raphael:</strong> Educating others to empower them was also 
important for him outside of the technology field. He helped children in 
Uganda -- who often lost their parents due to HIV -- to get education at 
the Kibaale Community Centre. He enabled school education for many of 
them so they can take care about themselves and their families in the 
long run. He founded an NGO to collection donations for this work, even 
on his work desk there was a piggy bank so that visitors can easily 
donate.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Matthias:</strong> There was a huge online rivalry between the 
users of his software and those on the other side: those who used 
another "operating system" and who called his software the "editor of 
the beast". This rivalry became an enduring part of hacker culture and 
the Free Software community. A huge fan of Monty Pythons, this year's 
winner did not shy away from engaging in such banter.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Raphael:</strong> His dedication was enormous. His family will 
not forget the moments, in which he disappeared on Christmas day, 
because he "needed to fix some bugs". It gave him great pleasure to 
develop and use his software, and he wanted to help others to also 
experience this joy. "If you are happy, I am happy!" was one of his 
sayings. He took every opportunity to work on his projects, even while 
in the hospital.
</p> 

<p>
<strong>Matthias:</strong>With his death on 3 August 2023 the Free 
Software community lost a person who enabled thousands of people to 
contribute efficiently to software freedom. We regret that he was not 
able to live longer with his beloved turtles, finishing his plans for a 
vacuum robot that could clean stairways, fixing bugs, implementing new 
features for the users of his software, and being here with us.
</p> 

<p>
<strong>Raphael:</strong> For his remarkable contributions to software 
freedom the European SFS Award 2024 goes posthumously to Bram Moolenaar, 
the creator of Vi IMproved -- or VIM.
</p>

<p><strong>Matthias:</strong> So, please join us in a big round of applause for Bram Moolenaar.</p>
