<h1>Find out our YH4F second edition winners!</h1>


<p>
A real-time plotter for microcontrollers; a classroom quiz platform; a 
radio; a device that provides bags to pick up your dog's poo; a game 
engine to help non-programmers develop their ideas; and a program to 
search for a file on your computer by its hash. These are the six 
projects that won the 2023 edition of Youth Hacking 4 Freedom.

If you are into coding, whatever your level is, you want to meet other 
Europeans teenagers, you want to develop a project, and you want to win 
a cash prize, <a href="/activities/yh4f/">Youth Hacking 4 Freedom</a> is 
for you! This coding contest for young Europeans, organized by the Free 
Software Foundation Europe, has just closed its second edition with the 
Award Ceremony weekend in Brussels where the six winners had the chance 
to  present their projects in front of their families, jury members, and after this 
weekend, new friends.
</p>

<p>
The winners' journey began almost a year ago, when they signed up to 
take part in the 2023 edition, which kicked off with six months of 
coding. The goal? To present a Free Software project that they had 
developed or improved. During this time, they met online regularly  and 
received advice not only from experts but also from their peers. Afterwars
a broad group of technology experts, <a 
href="/activities/yh4f/jury.html">the YH4F jury</a>, got to evaluate the 
project.
</p>

<p>
After a tough judging process due to the high quality of the 
projects submitted, the six winners, who will receive cash prizes 
ranging from €4,096 to €1,024 each, are the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ultimate Hacker Award:</strong> Davide Rorato for ArduPlot</li>  
<li><strong>Elite Hacker Award:</strong> Marlon Wolf for ClassQuiz</li>
<li><strong>Awesome Award:</strong> Simon Sommer for OpenRadio</li>  
<li><strong>Best Maker Award:</strong> Oriol Villegas Martin for DogBag4City</li>
<li><strong>Best Freedom Project Award:</strong> Marius Angermann for Artix Engine</li> 
<li><strong>Best Power User Tool Award:</strong> Matthias Kaak for hashfindutils</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>"Like last year, we were really impressed by the projects submitted, 
and even more so considering that we had a lot of submissions from 
really young teenagers. The jury had a hard time evaluating the 
projects, which not only includes considering if the idea can be useful 
for the community but also how the process was and its code quality. 
After this successful edition, and a really joyful weekend with the 
winners, their families and the jury, we cannot wait to announce the new edition 
soon", stated Alexander Sander, FSFE policy consultant and YH4F project 
manager.</p>

<h2>2023 Youth Hacking 4 Freedom winners’ projects</h2>
 
 <h3>Get a good understanding of your data with this plotter displaying it in different graphs</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“I participated in the first edition and I didn’t win, so this year  I tried again”</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/Dave879/MicroPlot">ArduPlot</a> is a 
real-time plotter for microcontrollers that uses a custom protocol to 
send data to be displayed in different graphs. Normally it acts as a 
traditional serial console, but when a specially formatted packet is 
received, it is parsed and converted into different visualisations, such 
as heat maps or line graphs. This allows the microcontroller to choose 
how best to display the data it has access to. It can also specify 
whether or not the data should be aggregated into the same graph, giving 
the user more flexibility.
</p>
 
<h3>An interactive quiz platforms for the classroom</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wanted to create a privacy friendly version of Kahoot! so students 
do not get tracked while using it, which I think it is really 
important!"</p>
<cite>Marlon, Elite Hacker winner</cite>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/mawoka-myblock/ClassQuiz/">ClassQuiz</a> 
serves as an alternative to Kahoot!, offering an interactive quiz 
platform for educators and presenters to create and host quizzes. 
Participants can compete by answering questions on their own devices, 
similar to the Kahoot! experience, while maintaining their privacy, 
which is especially important for an application intended to be used at 
schools.
</p>
 
<h3>Listen to any radio stream from around the world! Clock alarm included ;)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is my first big project that I have worked on alone. I had 
never done anything like this before and it was also a good opportunity 
to meet people and see other people's ideas!</p> 
<cite>Simon, Awesome Hacker winner</cite>

is an intelligent device that provides dog owners with small bags to 
collect their dogs' excrements. The user has a key that releases a bag 
at no cost to the user. No more “I forgot my bag excuse!”
</p>

<h3>Make your game idea a reality without coding!</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"My father found out about the contest by reading news on the 
internet and encouraged me to participate. I wanted to understand how a 
game engine works, so I decided to try to start one myself.</p>

<p>
<a href="">hashfindutils</a> is a program to efficiently search on your 
computer for a file whose hash you somehow already know. It helps you 
for example, to know if you have already downloaded a file or to find 
out duplicate and delete duplicated ones.

<h2>2023 Youth Hacking 4 Freedom: the competition</h2>
<p>
The second award edition started in January 2023 with almost 70 
registered young people from all over Europe who spent six months 
working on their own projects. Throughout the process, they had the 
opportunity to discuss their progress and solve their doubts in a 
monthly online meeting with experts and their peers. They also had a 
dedicated Youth Hacking 4 Freedom Matrix room where they could share 
progress, problems and success and also the FSFE team was available to 
answer their questions.
</p>

<p>
Once the projects had been submitted, the jury, made up of a wide range 
of experts in different technical areas, evaluated the projects. They 
did this first in an individual round and then, after choosing the final 
projects, through an online interview with the participants, who had to 
present their projects and answer the experts’ questions.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the six winners came to Brussels for the award ceremony, where 
they and one of their relatives enjoyed an invited weekend, which was 
possible thanks to the financial support of our donor Reinhard 
Wiesemann, full of activities and fun with the other winners and jury 
members, culminating in the award ceremony where the names of the 
winners were announced and the winners had the opportunity to present 
their projects.<style type="text/css">p { line-height: 115%;
