 <p id="introduction">"Ask Your Candidates" is an ongoing activity where you
 can always help. We encourage you to ask your local,
   regional, national candidates or parties where they stand regarding Free
 Software and connected topics. We maintain a <a
   href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/AskYourCandidates/Dates">list of upcoming
   elections</a>. Take a look at it to see if you can do something in your
 area, and help us to keep it up to date.</p>

<h2><a name="#questions">What to ask?</a></h2>

<p>Before you start asking questions you should think about what you want to
ask. We encourage you to dive into our <a href="/projects/work.html">different
  areas of activies</a>, <a href="/news/news.html">our news items</a>, and take
a look at <strong><a
    href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/AskYourCandidates">already asked
    questions</a></strong> as an inspiration for your own questions.</p>

<h2>How to contact candidates?</h2>

<h3>Contacting candidates</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Identify candidates working at the level where the election is taking place who are likely to respond to the question (have already tackled the issue, have worked in the area…)</li>
  <li>Send them the questions </li>
  <li>Publish the reply and <a href="/contact/contact.html">report it to us</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contacting the parties</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Create a survey <!--<a href="/projects/askyourcandidates/survey.html">(examples here)</a>-->, print it and send it to the relevant parties.</li>
  <li>Summarize the position of the parties you contacted on a <a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/AskYourCandidates/ELECTIONNAME-DATE">wiki page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="awareness">How to create awareness around your action ?</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/contact/contact.html">Inform us</a> that you want to start an action for this campaign.</li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/AskYourCandidates/ELECTIONNAME-DATE">Create a wiki page</a> (two examples under <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Bundestagswahl2009">parliamentary elections in Germany 2009</a> and <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/groups/vienna/Wahl2010">comunal election in Vienna 2010</a>) and list:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The position of the parties involved (the result of the survey you've sent them)</li>
    <li>The questions that you or your group have asked and the answers you've received</li>
  </ul>
  <li><a href="http://planet.fsfe.org">Blog regularly about your action</a>: when you start contacting candidates, what you do, when you receive an answer, etc…. Use also microblogging to give quick updates on where you're standing in the process.</li></ul>

  <!-- Why not keep it in the wiki? We would have to translate all the quesitons and answers if we move it to the static pages... <li>Once you've gathered enough answers, create a page for FSFE's website on the model of the <a href="/projects/btw09/btw09.html">German Federal election 2009 page</a>. Save the page under /projects/askyourcandidates/NAME_OF_ELECTION-YEAR. <a href="mailto:fellowship@fsfeurope.org">Submit it to FSFE</a> for publishing.</li> -->
