There is just less than one week until many Free Software enthusiasts from all over meet to celebrate “<a href="https://ilovefs.org/">I Love Free Software Day</a>”, an occasion to share gratitude and appreciation to those who make the dream of Free Software come true. This year, the focus of the celebration is on young generations; that’s why we are calling it “I Love Free Software Day 2024 – Forging the Future with Free Software”! In Italy, the UK, Germany, Spain, Denmark, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, the FSFE local groups, as well as other Free Software communities and enthusiasts, are going to make this day special.

<p>
This year, <a href="https://mobilizon.fr/events/6a1e8bba-fe08-48c9-b477-e544516493f4">a very big event</a> is taking place in Bergamo, Italy: together with <a href="https://bglug.it/">Bergamo Linux User Group</a> (BgLUG), we are hosting a workshop and discussion about the critical relevance Free Software has for music production. Our host for that night, <a href="https://livellosegreto.it/@kenobit">Kenobit</a>, is a chiptune music producer, a Fediverse administrator, and an exceptional creative mind! For I Love Free Software Day he is going to host a workshop about the use of Free Software for music production. This year’s I Love Free Software Day is focusing on young people, who are the next generation for Free Software. Kenobit is a well known DJ in Italy, and many young people can connect with his music. Moreover, FSFE’s project manager Dario Presutti is participating to moderate the conversation. The Bergamo event starts at 18:00 (CET) at Spazio Polaresco. The event is open to everybody; come and join the BgLUG for an evening full of Free Software!
