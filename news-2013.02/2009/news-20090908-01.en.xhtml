  <h1>
	  German Election: Ask your candidate about Free Software!
  </h1>

  <p newsteaser="yes">
	With the German federal elections coming up on September 27 2009, FSFE calls on all
	friends of freedom to ask the parties' candidates about their positions on Free
	Software and Open Standards. We have set up a page about the German
	<a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/Bundestagswahl2009">Bundestagswahl</a> to help
	you ask questions, and to collect the answers.
  </p>

  <p>
	In this way, you will help to push Free Software to the fore as a
	topic in this election campaign. Your candidates' answers will
	contribute to an overview of their positions. What do they know
	about Free Software and Open Standards? How do they plan to use
	Free Software to strengthen competition in the German IT market?
	What are their ideas for the use of Free Software in education?
	These are just some of the questions that we need answers to.
  </p>

  <p>
	We will collect your candidates' answers on the wiki page,
	and support them with an overview of the parties'
	programmes where they concern Free Software. Together we
	can help voters to make an informed decision about the
	next four years on September 27.
