    <h1>Information for Booth Volunteers</h1>

    <p>
      One of the main tasks of the Free Software Foundation Europe is to inform
      the public about Free Software and related topics. For this, it is
      essential to be present with a booth on tradeshows, fairs and expos.
    </p>

    <p>
      Helping at such a booth is a good way to get active for Free Software.
      Booth volunteers talk to people to explain Free Software and answer their
      questions, and they sell T-shirts and other merchandising.
    </p>

    <p>
      At every event, there will be experienced people from the FSFE present to
      support the booth volunteers, so it is not necessary at all to be an
      expert in every single aspect of Free Software. However, some basic
      knowledge about Free Software and the FSFE is helpful - the
      <a href="/about">"About us"</a> section is a good source for this.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a booth mailing list where FSFE's presence at all kinds of
      events is coordinated. Everybody intersted in helping out can subscribe
      <a href="http://mail.fsfeurope.org/mailman/listinfo/translators">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spreading the word about Free Software is a crucial task of the FSFE.
      Helping with this task means supporting the FSFE in its very basic work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working as a booth volunteer means at the same time supporting Free
      Software, meeting interesting people, and having a lot of fun.
