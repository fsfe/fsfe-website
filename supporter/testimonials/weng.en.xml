	  Freedom is an essential right of human beings, both in physical world
	  and digital world. However there are still many, many people being
	  bounded in the digital world without being aware of it. We truly
	  believe in the value and the human rights of software freedom, which
	  should be without borders. That is exactly why, though not in Europe,
	  we still strongly support the ideas, notions, and campaigns of FSFE.
