To generate logos for a given year:


1. modify sponsoring_buttons.svg so that it is for the correct year

- Open sponsoring_buttons.svg with a text editor (svg is xml).
- Look up what year appears, and replace all occurrences by the year you want.


2. automatically generate png files

- cd to the good directory and enter the following command:
  $ ./generate-all.sh YYYY
  where YYYY is for example 2012
- results are to be found in the newly created folder named after the given year.
