<h1 id="interview-with-Deniss-and-n0toose">Check out these cool 'Youth Hacking 4 Freedom' projects </h1>

  <p>
  While we wait for the projects developed by the participants of the second edition of the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom contest, let's go back to last year's edition to learn about two of the projects submitted.
  </p>

 <p>Deniss and n0toose are two participants from the first round of the competition. They worked on completely different projects, which shows the variety of ideas our participants can come up with. Let's take a look at <a href ="https://biscuit.edugit.org/3starblaze/star-vibe-lab">StarVibeLab</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/gettor-project/OnionSproutsBot">OnionSproutsBot</a>, the projects of Deniss and n0toose respectively.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Deniss is currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of 
 Latvia. He loves to learn new things and has already tried a few 
 hobbies like 3D modelling, drawing, UX design, music production, DJing 
 and of course programming. His first contact with coding was when he 
 was about 13 years old; he struggled at first, but later he became 
 quite good at it. For the first edition of the YH4F contest, Deniss 
 worked on his project StarVibeLab, combining his coding skills with 
 his love for music.
</p>

<p>
Our second guest is n0toose. He submitted a handy tool to help people download the <a 
href="https://www.torproject.org/">"Tor Browser"</a>, 
 a browser that helps users to stay anonymous while surfing the web. To 
 make it easier for people to download the "Tor Browser",
 n0toose developed a Telegram bot. This bot guides people through the process 
 of downloading and installing the "Tor Browser". This tool is 
 especially useful for people coming from countries with a strong surveillance 
 apparatus. 
</p>
 

 <p><strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: Hello 
    n0tosse and Deniss. Thank you for joining us.</p>
   
   <p>
   <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: How did you 
   come into contact with programming and how did you learn to program?
   </p>
  
 
        <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Deniss</span></strong>: To be 
    honest I'm not sure how exactly it all started. But I think it 
    started when I was like 13 years old. Back then I thought 
    programming was cool and I tried to learn it somehow but at first I 
    didn't succeed. I ended up trying again later and now I'm doing 
    fairly well.
  </p>
  
     <p>
     <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">n0toose</span></strong>: My 
     exposure to technology begun when I was very, very young. I would 
     say that I am essentially self-taught. I don't come from a family 
     of tech workers and my country's school system didn't really help 
     with the practical aspects of programming, so I really had to 
     depend on the Internet.
     </p>
    
 <p> 
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: And what 
    was your first contact with Free Software?</p>

 <p>
 <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Deniss</span></strong>: I am not 
    sure if that's the first encounter but I think it was when I started 
    using Emacs. I've been doing some research and found out about this 
    editor and once I got used to the keybindings, I fell in love with 
    it. I love the customizability and hackability of it, so that I can 
    customize the editor according to my needs. To be honest, I'm rarely 
    doing any sorts of customization at the moment but it's good to know 
    that it's an option and I'm sure that without this ability there 
    wouldn't be so many packages for Emacs.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: How did you both find out about the contest?</p>
  
   
    <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">n0toose</span></strong>: I tend 
    to follow the FSFE's work and found out about the competition 
    through the organization itself. I used the competition as a vehicle 
    to finish a very important project that I just never had enough time 
    for.
    </p>
    
         <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Deniss</span></strong>: I first 
    heard about YH4F in another hackathon I participated. And I loved 
    the idea about this contest being done over a longer period of time 
    instead of the usual "do as much as you can in 24h".
  </p>   
    
    <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Deniss, 
    how did you come up with your project idea StarVibeLab?
    </p>  
  
        <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Deniss</span></strong>: Before I 
    started making StarVibeLab, I was getting my feet wet in music 
    production and was in process of learning music theory in order to 
    gather some "tricks" to build better music. I then decided it would 
    be neat to make something interactive that would facilitate the 
    learning of music.</p>

	  StarVibeLab tool</a> is a web piano with information about music theory. In this case the C major chord.

    <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: When did you learn to play music?
    </p>     
  	<p>
  	<strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Deniss</span></strong>: About 
  	half a year before I started making StarVibeLab. I bought a midi 
  	keyboard around that time and also started learning music theory.
  	</p>
		    
	<p>
	<strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: n0tosse, how 
	did you come up with your project idea?
	</p>
	 
	 <p>
	 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">n0toose</span></strong>: There 
	 were already some applications that distributed links to different 
	 places that a person can download the Tor Browser from. For example, 
	 you could send an email or send a Twitter DM, and you'd get a set of 
	 URLs containing a download link. This is useful if you 
	 can't access torproject.org.
	 </p>

	  alt=" The menue of the get Tor Browser Telegram Bot" />
	</figure> 
	 
	<p>
	 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Was Telegram 
	 your first choice? And why did you choose Telegram?
	 </p>
	
    	 <p>
    	 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">n0toose</span></strong>: If I were to 
    	 recommend a secure communications app to someone, I'd probably 
    	 choose Signal or Matrix. However, pragmatically speaking, Telegram 
    	 is used by half a billion users everyday, allows bots to show 
    	 buttons to users and you can also send large files reliably. It's 
    	 very ideal if you want to reach as many people as possible, 
    	 regardless of where they come from or what they do.
      </p> 
    
	 <p>
	 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: What 
	 motivated you to keep working on your projects?
	 </p>
	 
	<p>
  	<strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Deniss</span></strong>: Perhaps 
  	the fact that I was participating in a contest. I've also set some 
  	milestones which helped me tracking my progress and motivated me to 
  	keep going. Oh, and I also got to work with Clojure(Script) -- a 
  	language that I learned fairly recently and which I really adore 
  	because it doesn't get in a way and lets me to focus on the problem I 
  	want to solve.
  	</p>
		
 <p><strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Did any of you encounter 
 any problems during the coding period or the building period?
 </p>	

 <p>
  <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Deniss</span></strong>: I did 
  encounter problems but they weren't huge ones. I just had to stitch 
  things together, while also making sure that I don't end up in an 
  unmanageable mess of a code. A lot of small problems.
 </p>
		
 <p>
  <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">n0toose</span></strong>: I had 
  actually worked on several proofs of concept before the competition, so 
  I used the competition as an opportunity to turn it into something 
  usable. The code wasn't very clean, and certain core features, such as 
  being able to use other languages, were implemented with the help of 
  other contributors later down the line. But, at the time, the basic 
  concept finally worked.
 </p>

 <p>
  <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Will you continue to work on your projects?
 </p>

 <p>
  <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Deniss</span></strong>: 
  Perhaps in the future but not right now. I have studies, am 
  participating in faculty's student council, have a part-time programmer 
  job and also would like to explore the world of embedded programming. 
  StarVibeLab is a way for me to intertwine music learning with 
  programming and since I've set music production aside (for now), the 
  StarVibeLab gets pushed aside as well.
 </p>

 <p>
 Nonetheless I have several features and milestones written down which I 
 could start tackling once I get back to the project. Finding better 
 sound files instead of synthesizing my own and including more theory are 
 the tasks that I feel are the most important to solve.
 </p>
	
	
 <p>
  <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Thank you both for 
 your time and we wish you both good luck with your next steps.
 </p>

 <p>
 The coding period for the second edition of YH4F is still ongoing. This 
 competition offers young people between 14 and 18 the opportunity 
 to challenge themselves, meet like-minded people and win cash 
 prizes.
 </p>

 <p>
 Launched by the FSFE, YH4F aims to inspire young people 
 by giving them the chance to hack a software project in a 
 fair and fun way, while meeting other young developers from all over 
 Europe.
