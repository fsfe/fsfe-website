    <title>Berlin Fellowship Meeting with the topic "web tracking" in Berlin, Germany</title>
   <body>
    On Thursday, February 13, there will be the next Berlin Fellowshipmeeting, as usual in the e-lok (near Ostkreuz). This time, Felix will inspire us with insights from his research about current web tracking technologies and how to best avoid them. 

    As usual, the Fellowship meeting is a good possibility to meet other Fellows as well as other Free Software enthusiasts. You can get good food and best drinks at e-lok for a reasonable price and good mood for no cost. Official start is at 19:30.
