      <p>FrOSCon is a Free Software conference, organised by the
      computer science department of the University Bonn-Rhein-Sieg and
      other local initiatives. Visitors will be offered an exciting
      program with talks and workshops for visitors of all ages. As usual, the
      FSFE will be present with a booth. We are looking forward to have a chat
      with you about Free Software, technology, and politics.</p>
