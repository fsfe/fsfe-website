   <p>As in previous years, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Media and Computer Science, abbreviated to ‘EMI’, is organising the EMI Forum. As part of these events, experts from industry and the university shed light on current developments in electrical engineering, media and computer science. The aim is to present relevant topics for students, university members and the interested public. We look forward to stimulating discussions. The EMI Forum is supported by the City of Amberg.</p>
   <p>On 16 December we will discuss Free Software together. Bonnie Mehring will talk about the &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; initiative of the Free Software Foundation Europe and shows why &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; affects more than just public administration. A special focus will be placed on the impact on small and medium-sized enterprises. The event starts at 17:30 and is open to all interested parties free of charge.</p>
