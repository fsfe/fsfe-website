<h3>Copyright originality in EU</h3>
<p>The  debate about copyright originality threshold is getting more and more interesting around European jurisdictions due to several significant  decisions of the Court of Justice of EU. In the last days, the  discussion was newly triggered by ´Red Bus´ case in UK and ´newspapers´  case in Slovakia. <i>See</i> <a

<h3>Library License</h3>
<p>Library License as a way for publishers to grant non-commercial lending rights to libraries through a licensing framework. “Explicitly modeled on Creative Commons licenses with a similar eye towards simplicity and granularity, Library Licenses could be constructed in several different ways. The most simple example is a straightforward grant, where libraries could acquire and then lend ebooks after they had been on the market for a period of time ranging from instantaneous to some number of years. <i>See</i> <a href="http://dp.la/2012/01/12/press-library-license-a-suggested-framework/"> article by Kenny Whitebloom</a> and <a href="http://librarylicense.org/">project website</a>;</p>

<h3>Pirates lose final appeal</h3>
<p>Three founders of The Pirate Bay have lost an appeal against a conviction for illegally sharing copyrighted content. <i>See</i> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11847200"> article at BBC</a> and <a href="http://the1709blog.blogspot.com/2012/02/pirates-lose-final-appeal.html">article at 1709blog</a>;</p>

<h3>Google changes its privacy policy</h3>
<p>With the new policy in place, Google is taking a more proactive approach  toward getting more relevant results to you no matter where you are.  What is perhaps slightly different is that the blanket policy means that  you will be treated as a single user across all Google services. <i>See</i> <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/01/24/google-is-changing-its-privacy-policies-with-one-document-to-rule-them-all/"> article at The Next Web</a>;</p>


<h3>Commission proposes a comprehensive reform of the data protection rules</h3>
<p>The  European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the  EU's  1995 data protection rules to strengthen online privacy rights and   boost Europe's digital economy. A  single law will do away with the  current fragmentation and costly  administrative burdens, leading to  savings for businesses of around €2.3  billion a year. The initiative  will help reinforce consumer confidence  in online services, providing a  much needed boost to growth, jobs and  innovation in Europe. <i>See</i> <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/newsroom/data-protection/news/120125_en.htm"> website of European Commission</a>;</p>

<h3>Enter do-not-track (DNT) standard. </h3>
<p>Neelie  Kroes hopes that a standard known as “do not track” (DNT) will have a  big role to play for the future of online privacy. Do Not Track is a  technology and policy proposal that enables users to  opt out of  tracking by websites they do not visit, including analytics  services,  advertising networks, and social platforms. <i>See</i> <a href="http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/neelie-kroes/donottrack/"> blog of Neelie Kroes</a> and <a href="http://donottrack.us/"> website of the project</a>;</p>

<h3>iBooks Author EULA restrictions invite antitrust concerns</h3>

<h3>Opinion: Copyright, Trademark and Patents are Theft</h3>
<p>To be clear, I’m a firm defender of actual property rights, even to an absolutist point. That’s exactly why I oppose the charade known as "intellectual property". <i>See</i> <a href="http://www.oudaily.com/news/2012/jan/31/column-intellectual-property-theft/"> article at OUDaily</a>;</p>

<h3>iPad Litigations</h3>
<p>Court of Appeal of the Hague rejected Apple's appeal, finding no infringement of their Community Design covering the iPad.
