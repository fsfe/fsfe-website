    <title>Questions for Microsoft on open formats</title>
    <description>    
    Featured article by <a href="/about/people/greve">Georg Greve</a> and <a
    href="/about/jakobs/">Joachim Jakobs</a> about the need for Open Standards
    in archival, and why using MS-OOXML risks future data loss: "Digital
    information could potentially be stored without loss of quality for a very
    long time to come.  But without knowledge about the encoding, our documents
    will become a meaningless series of ones and zeroes to future generations,
    just like cave paintings are too often meaningless bits of colour on stone
    to us."
