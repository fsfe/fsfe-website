    <p class="tagline">Free as in Freedom</p>

    <p>
      Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is a non-profit and in some
      countries charitable organisation dedicated to
      <a href="documents/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>. FSFE maintains
      that the freedoms to use, study, share and improve software are critical
      to ensure equal participation in the information age. We work to create
      general understanding and support for software freedom in politics, law
      and society-at-large.  We also promote the development of technologies,
	  such as the <a href="/about/basics/gnuproject.html">GNU</a>/Linux operating system, that deliver these freedoms to
      all participants in digital society.
    </p>

    <p>
      FSFE's work is made possible by many individual contributions, in
      particular to the
      <a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org/">Fellowship of FSFE</a>. One way to
      contribute is to
      <a href="http://fellowship.fsfe.org/join">join now</a>, and to
      encourage others to do likewise.
