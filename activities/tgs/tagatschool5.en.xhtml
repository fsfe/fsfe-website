    <h1>TUX&amp;GNU@school - 5th edition</h1>

    <p><i>Every month the column <a
    href="/activities/tgs/tgs.en.html">TUX&amp;GNU@school
    [2]</a> reports about free software, a homepage on the topic
    and an easy to implement idea. This month I talk about <a
    href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/">Tuxpaint
    [3]</a>, a free painting program for children, about "<a
    href="http://www.debian.org">Debian [4]</a> at school" and
    about the idea "Easily understanding large numbers".</i></p>

    <p>Welcome to the 5th edition. As I promised last time, there
    are some news today. This is the first edition released under
    the roof of the <a href="/">Free
    Software Foundation Europe [5]</a> and the <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project[6]</a>. In this context
    TUX&amp;GNU@school will be released in different languages in
    the future but right now only in German and English. All
    earlier edition are in english available too (<a
    href="/activities/tgs/tagatschool1.en.html">TGS 1
    [7]</a>, <a
    href="/activities/tgs/tagatschool2.en.html">TGS 2
    [8]</a>, <a
    href="/activities/tgs/tagatschool3.en.html">TGS 3
    [9]</a> and <a
    href="/activities/tgs/tagatschool4.en.html">TGS 4
    [10]</a>). If there is anybody reading one of the older
    editions who want to implement an idea, go on. At this point I
    want to thank Christian Selig and Kristian Rink for their
    support with writing and translating. But we don't want to lose
    too much time, therefore I move on to the program introduction
    of this time.</p>

    <h3>Tuxpaint - Painting is fun</h3>

    <p><a href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/">Tuxpaint
    [3]</a> is actually a free painting programm for children which
    is released under the <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#TOCGPL">GNU GPL
    [11]</a>. I wrote "actually" because I heard of many adults who
    can't stop painting with tuxpaint ;-). I tested the version
    0.91. of the 16.11.2001 under <a
    href="http://www.debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux [4]</a>
    testing/unstable. On Debian you can easily install the program
    with the following shell command: <tt>apt-get install
    tuxpaint</tt>. The version 0.9.2 is the most up to date one
    which is available in numerous languages. These are e.g.
    German, French, English, Danish, etc. to name only a few. You
    can find the full list on the <a
    href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/features">homepage
    of the project [12]</a>. What we surely should mention are the
    <a
    href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/download">ports[13]</a>
    to the common platforms, such as GNU/Linux, Windows, MacOS X
    and FreeBSD. As with all Free Software, the sourcecode is
    available, so there shouldn't be a bar to other ports.</p>

    <p>When you start Tuxpaint either over the console or by a
    click on the corresponding icon, Tux with a brush in his hand
    appears. After a click in the window or a few seconds of
    waiting a screen as shown in screenshot 1 comes up. The
    interface is divided into five sections. On the left there is
    the tool panel, containing different tool groups, as well as
    general functions such as <i>Print</i>, <i>Save</i> and
    <i>Quit</i>. For each tool group, there are different choices
    on the right. An example for this are the different painting
    sizes of the color brush. A further example is shown in
    screenshot 1, that is to say the really numerous stamps.
    Whenever it's possible to use a color with a certain function,
    the choice can be made in the second last row. Right beneath,
    Tux, the little penguin, sits around, always saying something
    about each action. Either he gives tips or he explains on what
    you are clicking or what an selected stamp is showing. And
    eventually the most important and largest part of the screen
    viz, the artist's canvas which is situated in the middle. As
    you can see in screenshot 1 I made already some art ;-).</p>

    <p><img src="./img/tuxpaint.en.png"
    alt="Screenshot 1: Tuxpaint in action" width="648" height="508"
    border="0" /></p>

    <h5>Screenshot 1: Tuxpaint in action</h5>
    <br />
    <br />
     

    <p>At the moment I have to brace up that I'm not painting and
    playing with Tuxpaint, but continuing this column. So as every
    good program for infants there is a sound for each action and
    for every click in Tuxpaint. For instance, when you use the
    rubber it sounds as if you really used one on your screen. This
    property is special with the stamps. The numbers for 0 to 9 are
    spoken in english and when you select the ghost stamp, it right
    then begins to ulutate. An the other hand when you select the
    moon landing vehicle, you can hear Neil Armstrong saying his
    famous first sentence. And there are a lot more of these
    special sounds for the stamps.</p>

    <p>As already mentioned the program is made for infants in the
    first place and therefore the <i>Open</i> dialog is made quite
    easy as you can see in screenshot 2. It's not necessary to
    click trough many directories till you find your picture and in
    any case you don't know what picture it is by means of the file
    name. In Tuxpaint the artist simply clicks on the <i>Open</i>
    button and then chooses the right picture in the window which
    appears where the canvas was before. You may also delete one of
    the pictures right here. By the way, under GNU/Linux all
    pictures are saved in a directory called
    <tt>.tuxpaint/saved</tt> which is always situated in the own
    home directory. The pictures are filed in the PNG format which
    is a free and standardised format. Even easier is printing. You
    have to simply click on <i>Print</i> and the picture gets
    printed, provided that mum or dad installed the printer
    correctly.</p>

    <p><img src="img/tuxpaint.open.en.png"
    alt="Screenshot 2: Tuxpaint opens new pictures" width="648"
    height="508" border="0" /></p>

    <h5>Screenshot 2: Tuxpaint opens new pictures</h5>
    <br />
    <br />
     

    <p>When you then accomplished it once to stop painting and you
    leave the program, of course Tux is pointing you out that you
    didn't save your picture yet and gives you right now the
    possibility to change this. I hope that all these who didn't
    know Tuxpaint yet now have a good mind to try it out. Tuxpaint
    is really a genial part of software that you can't keep back to
    your children. Therefore a large "thank you" to Bill Kendrick
    for his software masterpiece and we are all anxious to what you
    will create in the future.</p>

    <p>But now continues to the topic "Debian at school".</p>

    <h3>Debian at school</h3>

    <p>Originally I wanted to introduce only the project <a
    href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-jr">"Debian Jr."
    [14]</a> at his place. But in the meantime it arises that
    further subprojects of Debian suitable to the topic came into
    being and that's why I want to try to introduce all the
    relevant projects. These are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-jr">Debian
      Jr. [14]</a> - "Debian for children from 1 to 99"</li>

      <li><a href="http://ddtp.debian.org">DDTP [15]</a> - The
      Debian Description Translation Project</li>

      <li><a href="http://wiki.debian.net/debianedu">DebianEDU
      [16]</a> - Debian as the best distribution for education</li>

      <li><a
      href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-desktop">Debian
      Desktop [17]</a> - Simplification for Debian on the
      desktop</li>
    </ul>
    But before I come to the single items it's perhaps useful to
    introduce Debian in the first instance. Debian is a project
    which, quite similar to Linux (the kernel) itself, is developed
    and supported by volunteers from all over the world. Surely the
    most well-known distribution of this group is Debian GNU/Linux
    which is available for <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports">11
    hardware architectures [18]</a> until now. Furthermore there
    are projects with other kernels, such as <a
    href="http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd">Debian GNU/Hurd
    [19]</a> and <a
    href="http://www.debian.org/ports/freebsd">Debian GNU/FreeBSD
    [20]</a> <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/netbsd">(NetBSD)
    [21]</a>, plus other <a
    href="http://www.debian.org/devel">subprojects [22]</a>. <br />
    <br />
     

    <p><a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-jr">Debian Jr.
    [14]</a>, as the title already says, want to make the Debian
    distribution easier and more attractive for children. Thereby
    the primary target group are children up to eight years. When
    once the distribution is adapted optimally for children of this
    age they want to repeat the same thing for children between 8
    and 12. The subproject provides numerous <a
    href="http://wiki.debian.net/JuniorPackages">Meta packages
    [23]</a> which are packages containing thematically sorted
    programs. Furthermore they want to provide means for parents
    and administrators too to customise the system to the new
    target group's needs. Of course as usual with Free Software
    Debian Jr. cooperates with related projects, such as, for
    example, the <a href="http://www.seul.org/edu">SEUL/edu
    project[25]</a> which has been introduced in the <a
    href="/activities/tgs/tagatschool4.en.html">4th
    edition [24]</a>. What's just as important for the young debian
    users is the adaption to their mother tongue. This is a goal
    for Debian Jr. too, but right for this there is another special
    subproject: <a href="http://ddtp.debian.org">DDTP [15]</a>.</p>

    <p><img src="img/debian.en.png"
    alt="Screenshot 3: The homepage of Debian" width="800"
    height="600" border="0" /></p>

    <h5>Screenshot 3: The homepage of Debian</h5>
    <br />
    <br />
     

    <p>The <a href="http://ddtp.debian.org">DDTP - Debian
    Description Translation Project's [15]</a> original goal was
    the translation of all package descriptions into all languages
    spoken on this planet. In the unstable version of Debian there
    are meanwhile more than 10000 packages, which means a lot of
    work. And even though, if I remember correctly for some
    languages already all packages descriptions are translated. As
    already indicated above DDTP currently limits not only to
    package descriptions but translates also texts of debian-own
    configuration tool debconf and will probably also help or do
    the translation of the new <a
    href="http://people.debian.org/~mbc/di.html">"debian-installer"
    [26]</a>. By the way it's very easy to help with the
    translations, you need only an email client and the very good
    written <a
    href="http://ddtp.debian.org/how_it_works/index.en.html">instructions
    [27]</a> of Michael Bramer, the project founder.</p>

    <p>DebianEDU is still quite young. It was founded by Raphael
    Hertzog in September 6, 2002. According to the <a
    href="http://wiki.debian.net/debianedu">homepage [16]</a> the
    main goal is to create the best GNU/Linux distribution for
    schools and education. DebianEDU originated in the <a
    href="http://logiciels-libres-cndp.ac-versailles.fr/distribution.html">
    French distribution with almost the same name [28]</a>
    developed in France specifically for this task. The knowledge
    and programs made for and with this work are intended to flow
    into the project and they shall be pursued and completed. In
    contrast to Debian Jr. they focus on software which could be
    important at school or in education in general. Of course there
    are several overlappings but by tight cooperation they avoid
    doubled work. Here too they grapple with the production and
    provision of meta packages which are already now rather
    numerous <a
    href="http://wiki.debian.net/DebianEdu">[29]</a>.</p>

    <p>The fourth and last Debian project I want to introduce here
    is likewise still very young. The goal of <a
    href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-desktop">Debian
    Desktop [17]</a> is it to make Debian GNU/Linux easier and more
    attractive for desktop users. Its aims such as an easy
    installation with integrated and automatic hardware detection
    are on the to-do list, just as the provision of graphical
    configuration tools like <a href="http://www.webmin.com">Webmin
    [30]</a>.</p>

    <p>Debian GNU/Linux is not only a manifold distribution, it is
    also the groundwork of many more or less successful commercial
    distributions. Beneath commercial derivatives like <a
    href="http://www.libranet.com">Libranet [31]</a>, <a
    href="http://www.progeny.com">Progeny [32]</a>, <a
    href="http://www.xandros.com">Xandros [33]</a> or <a
    href="http://www.lindows.com">Lindows [34]</a> which are
    unfortunately frequently mixed with proprietary software there
    are however free projects too which are built on the stable
    foundation of Debian. The most important example of this kind
    is <a href="http://www.knoppix.de">Knoppix [35]</a> at the
    moment. Unfortunately even this distribution isn't entirely
    free from proprietary software. Knoppix is a distribution
    running completely from CD-ROM which isn't only useful for
    demonstration purposes. But more infos about this below. In
    contrast du vanilla Debian, you can worrilessly recommend <a
    href="http://www.knoppix.de">Knoppix [35]</a> to absolute
    GNU/Linux newbies too.</p>

    <p>But now we're going on to the software idea of this
    edition.</p>

    <h3>"Easily understanding large numbers"</h3>

    <p>Something which is no problem for most of us, it's
    especially pupils in the lower classes that still have to learn
    it grindingly: Large numbers. What I mean with "Large numbers"
    is not imperatively one million or larger but already 100, 1000
    or then 10000. With numbers up to 100, it's mostly possible to
    represent them with everyday and eidetic examples, forming a
    base on which children can imagine the numbers in an abstract
    form by and by. But then with numbers larger than 100 it
    becomes more difficult to find examples, let alone to plot
    them. Well in this range of numbers you begin to abstract the
    numbers i.e. to separate them from concrete measures and
    values.</p>

    <p>Here in Switzerland, but probably not only here, in many
    cases little wood or plastic cubes are used. These are approx.
    1 x 1 x 1 cm large and ten of them in a line result in a
    decadic row. Ten decadic rows side by side result in a one
    hundred field and ten of these fields, one stacked on the
    other, respectively side by side then result in a one thousand
    cube respectively in a one thousand field. The largest still
    useful applicable field is the ten thousend field which
    consists of 100 one hundred fields aligned in a square. I hope
    that the people who not already knew or saw these fields and
    cubes can imagine them on the basis of my descriptions.</p>
    Well but what and how shall you transform this into software ?
    I would like to see that handily <a
    href="http://www.opengl.com">OpenGL [36]</a> or general 3D
    programmers generate these fields and cubes three-dimensionally
    and show them on screen. If children not only have to imagine
    this numbers but also can see them on screen, it would be much
    easier for them to calculate with large numbers. Perhaps they
    can even enter numbers into the computer and it generates the
    corresponding field and cube forms. On the other hand it would
    be interesting to see calculuses in these forms. The pupils
    then must calculate them with help of the 3D objects and
    afterwards they could compare their result with the computer's
    one. Well, it would be nice when <a
    href="mailto:foxman@lugo.ch">I [1]</a> receive some
    implementations until next time which I then could introduce in
    TUX&amp;GNU@school 6 at the end of January 2003. There are no
    limits for further going ideas except for the programmer's
    skills. 

    <p>But now to the last section, the news.</p>

    <h3>News and up to date program versions</h3>

    <h4>BSI ships Knoppix at no cost:</h4>

    <p>The German <a href="http://www.bsi.de">"Bundesamt für
    Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik" [37]</a> (Federal Office
    for information technology security) ships <a
    href="http://www.knoppix.de">Knoppix [35]</a> CD-ROMs. If you
    send them a post-paid readdressed C5 envelope, the German BSI
    will send you a GNU/Linux distribution running completely from
    CD. You can find more information about this on their <a
    href="http://www.bsi.de/produkte/knoppix/index.htm">Knoppix
    page [38]</a>.</p>

    <h4>FreeEduc - Knoppix for free education software</h4>

    <p>Although some time has passed, I want to mention it here
    once again. At the end of October 2002 the <a
    href="http://www.ofset.org">OFSET - Organisation for Free
    Software in Education and Teaching [39]</a> released the first
    version of <a
    href="http://www.ofset.org/projects/edusoft/edusoft.html">Freeduc
    [40]</a>. It's a distribution based on <a
    href="http://www.knoppix.de">Knoppix [35]</a> whose main
    purpose is the demonstration of free educational software.
    Similar to Knoppix all of Freeduc's software runs directly from
    CD and you don't need to install anything. Thanks to the very
    good automatic hardware detection you don't need to configure
    anything yourself too. On one of the next days or weeks they
    want to release the version 1.2 and I think we can eagerly look
    forward to it.</p>

    <h4>Up to date program versions</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://edu.kde.org/ktouch">KTouch</a> 1.0 - Type
      writing course under KDE 3.0.5 (<a
      href="/activities/tgs/tagatschool1.en.html">TGS

      5</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />
     

    <p>Well, this was the fifth edition of TGS. But before I say
    good bye for this time there are still some questions left:
    After the last publication of TUX&amp;GNU@school someone on <a
    href="http://www.pro-linux.de">pro-linux.de [41]</a> asked if
    it would be possible to receive the new edition by newsletter
    too. Because I don't think the idea is bad I want to ask now
    whether there is interest in general for such a version ? For
    this all persons who are interesting in a newsletter version
    should send <a href="mailto:foxman@lugo.ch">me [1]</a> an email
    till the next edition, please. Of course as ever I'm interested
    in questions, criticism, comments and hints which should be
    sent to the same location.</p>

    <p>But now that's really the end of this time. Good luck and a
    happy new year is the last I want to say.</p>

    <h4>About the author:</h4>

    <p>Mario Fux finished 1999 the PrimarlehrerInnenseminar in Brig
    after he made up mathematical and natural scientifical matura.
    In a body with two colleagues he founded the <a
    href="http://www.edux.ch">"ALIS - Arbeitsgruppe Linux an
    Schulen"</a> (Swiss work group for linux at school). Meanwhile
    he studies at the <a href="http://www.ethz.ch">Swiss Federal
    Institut of Technology Zurich</a> <a
    href="http://www.ee.ethz.ch">informations technology and
    electrical engineering</a>. And if he once doesn't spend his
    time in front of the PC, he sits at his nature pond in the <a
    href="http://www.randa.ch">mountains</a>.</p>
