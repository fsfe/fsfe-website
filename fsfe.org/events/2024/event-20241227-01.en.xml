      <p>For another year, the FSFE will be present at the Chaos Communication Congress, as part of the Bits &amp; BÃ¤ume habitat,  a space that welcomes all creatures! At our assembly, we will have a booth and a common space for FSFE members, friends and supporters to discuss, meet, hack and organise. There, we will have some workshops and our traditional Free Software song singing.</p>
     <p>Whether you're a Free Software enthusiast or just enjoy the company of friendly geeks, our assembly is for you!. Join us and engage in lively discussions, collaborate on projects, and connect with a diverse community passionate about technology and the values of Free Software. </p>
