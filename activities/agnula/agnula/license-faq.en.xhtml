<h2>Frequently Answered Questions</h2>
</center>

<ul>

<li><b>What does the <a href="license.html">AGNULA trademark
license</a> say?</b><br /><br /> The <a href="license.html">AGNULA
trademark license</a> is public, so you can read it for yourself.<br
/>If you wish to see its effect summarised: It allows anyone to freely
use the AGNULA name and logo -- as well as modifications of it -- for
any kind of commercial distribution, product or service, <b>as long as
it is entirely <a href="/documents/freesoftware.html">Free
Software</a>.</b></li><br />

<li><b>What is the purpose of the trademark license?</b><br /><br />
When you see a distribution or product bearing the "AGNULA" name or
logo, you can be sure that it is entirely <a
href="/documents/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a> and will
therefore not make you dependent by introducing some non-Free Software
through the back-door.<br />In essence, the <a
href="license.html">AGNULA trademark license</a> aims to establish a
brand for Free Software audio and multimedia distributions that will
allow users to make a choice for freedom.</li><br />

<li><b>I think that someone has violated the license, what do I
do?</b><br /><br />If you think you have found a <a
href="license.html">AGNULA trademark license</a> violation, please
send mail to <a
href="mailto:contact@fsfe.org">contact@fsfe.org</a> and let us
know about it. We will investigate and -- if necessary -- act
accordingly.<br />Information you should always provide in your email
is <b>who</b> is in violation (name, email, web address), <b>how</b>
you think they violate the trademark license and any discussion you
may already have had with them.</li><br />

<li><b>I have a question that is not covered in this FAQ</b><br /><br />
