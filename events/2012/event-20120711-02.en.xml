    <title>Free Software, transparency, democracy</title>
    <body>
      <p>
More transparency in the heart of Europe: The European Parliament has built a software tool which lets the people working there track the development of proposals into laws. The Parliament is going to release this program, called AT4AM, as Free Software. 
      </p>

      <p>
At an <a href="http://epfsug.eu/content/at4am-all">event in the European Parliament</a>, FSFE's President Karsten Gerloff will discuss what Free Software means for democracy. FSFE's General Counsel Carlo Piana will talk about choosing the right license for AT4AM.
      </p>
      <p>
Attendance is free of charge, but registration is required in order to enter the Parliament building. The event is organised by the <a href="http://epfsug.eu">European Parliament Free Software User Group</a> (EPFSUG), and hosted by MEP Marie-Christine Vergiat.
