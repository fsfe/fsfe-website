        The Document Foundation is a charitable foundation that works to eliminate the digital divide in society by giving everyone access to office productivity tools free of charge, thus enabling them to participate as full citizens in the 21st century. We support the preservation of mother tongues by encouraging everybody to translate, document, support, and promote our office productivity tools into their mother tongue; and enable users to retain the intellectual property in the documents they create, by supporting open document formats and open standards.
