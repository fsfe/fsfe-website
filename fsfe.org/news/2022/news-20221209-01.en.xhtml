<h1 id="interview-with-Hector">Discover more YH4F projects and learn about the participants Héctor and Leonardo</h1>

  <p>
   Are you thinking about registering for the second edition of Youth 
   Hacking 4 Freedom? But you are not yet sure? Two participants from 
   the last edition, Héctor and Leonardo, talked with us about the 
   projects they developed and their journey throughout the Free 
   Software world! Discover their experiences during the first edition 
   of YH4F.
  </p>

 <p>
 While the second edition of the YH4F contest is now open for <a 
 href="/activities/yh4f">registration</a>, the first edition of the 
 Youth Hacking 4 Freedom contest has ended with 35 amazingly well done 
 projects. There are no limits to the possibilities of projects that 
 could be submitted and every technical idea is welcome. Among those 
 great inspiring ones were Héctor's and Leonardo's projects: 
 LibreHomework and Presents, respectively.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Leonardo is studying Computer Science Engineering in Milan. He has been an 
 active member of the European Youth Parliament since 2019 and among his 
 hobbies was already hacking, even before participating in the 
 contest. Our second guest is Héctor, the youngest winner of the first 
 edition of the Youth Hacking 4 Freedom contest. Héctor has always been 
 interested in science and in understanding the world around him in 
 greater detail. He has created LibreHomework out of the desire to help 
 others with learning and organising their homework.
 </p>
 

 <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce"> FSFE</span></strong>: Hello 
    Leonardo and Héctor. Thank you for joining us.
  </p>
   
   <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Leonardo, 
    you have already been in contact with Free Software before the YH4F 
    contest but you have not always loved it. When did you start to 
    appreciate Free Software for the concept itself?
  </p>
  
      <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Leonardo</span></strong>: I would 
    say that I am aware of Free Software since I have started using 
    computers, using LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office, GIMP 
    instead of Adobe Photoshop, etc. but I have always seen them as the 
    cheaper (and worse) alternatives to the popular programs that 
    everyone was using. Someone would say, I was seeing it free as in 
    free beer and not as in freedom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  My actual interest in Free Software is way more recent and probably 
  started about 2 years ago after I saw the documentary ‘The 
  Social Dilemma’ and started educating myself a bit about digital 
  privacy and the ethical use of technology. I asked myself how some 
  products I was using every day could be free for everyone. I started 
  looking for some alternatives to them, and joined some communities on 
  Mastodon and Reddit of people who care about those topics. This whole 
  process of digging online, getting in touch with new people and caring 
  about the consequences of my approach to technology led me to 
  (re)discover the big world of Free Software: this time together with 
  its philosophy and principles that made me fall in love with it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: And how did you learn programming?
  </p>
    <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Leonardo</span></strong>: My 
    first contact with programming dates back to when I was 13: my 
    middle school technology teacher showed us one day a website where 
    you had to solve some Angry Birds puzzles using block-coding. I 
    enjoyed it so much that I kept on playing it as soon as I came home. 
    Then, I thought, if that game was so fun, coding something from 
    scratch could be even better!</p>

<p>
I started watching some videos online on how to start coding with 
JavaScript, even though I have never actually learned it. But the first 
programming language I can say I learned is Python, thanks to a "Summer 
Camp": I attended at a school called H-Farm near my home city. This 
course has been followed, in the past 6 years, by many other courses and 
tutorials about other languages such as C# and Flutter/Dart, which is 
the one I used for my YH4F project.
  </p>
  
    <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Héctor, what about you how did you learn programming?
  <p>
    <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33"><br/>Héctor</span></strong>: Like 
    most people I started with Scratch at the age of 10-11 and then I 
    moved towards more advanced languages like Javascript and Python. I 
    was initially fond of game development but now I like working on 
    servers and backend stuff.</p>
  
<p>
<strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: So, you 
already had some knowledge about coding. Why did you join the YH4F 
contest?
</p>
	
	 <p>
	 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Héctor</span></strong>: My IT 
	 teacher encouraged me to participate in the contest, so the project 
	 would decide my final mark. Working on an actual programming project 
	 was way more exciting than doing what my classmates were doing. I 
	 joined the contest in October and worked, since then, on the idea: the 
	 app, the server and the daemon.</p>
	 
	<p>
	 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: And what 
	 about you, Leonardo, what motivated you to join our competition?
	 </p>
	
	 <p>
	 <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Leonardo</span></strong>: Not long 
	 after the "change" I mentioned, I saw an advertisement for this 
	 contest, organized by the Free Software Foundation Europe, that was 
	 aiming to promote and encourage the Free Software culture among young 
	 minds. I thought it was not only a commendable idea, but also a great 
	 opportunity for me to merge my recent interest for FOSS with my 
	 passion for coding. So I decided to participate, re-building from 
	 scratch my recent coding project in order to make it fully Free 
	 Software, and ready to be used by large communities.</p>
	
	 
	<p>
	 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: How did you 
	 came up with your individual project idea?
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Leonardo</span></strong>:The idea 
	 for <a href="https://codeberg.org/LezSoft/Presents">"Presents"</a> 
	 came into my mind back in 2020. After the lockdown period caused by 
	 the COVID-19 pandemic, it was time to think about birthday gifts for 
	 all the friends that had turned 18 during the lockdown (which were a 
	 lot, since my classmates and I are born in 2002). Since it takes me 
	 some time to come up with a good gift idea for a friend, and I'm 
	 definitely a lazy person, I thought: shouldn't there be an easier way 
	 for all this?</p>

<p>
That is how I started shaping the idea of this app in which people could 
add their wishes and forget about them while their friends or family 
could get inspiration from it to make the perfect gift without ruining 
the surprise effect. I started looking online for the best tech stack to 
realize this project. I ended up following some really great quality 
tutorials about the programming language Flutter and Googles App 
development platform Firebase. They made me publish the first version of 
the app in October 2020! But then I didn't like the fact that my own app 
wasn't following the Free Software philosophy, so I took the YH4F 
contest as an opportunity to develop a better, fresher and free version 
of Presents, Presents 2.0.
</p>
		
<p>
<strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Héctor</span></strong>: Since I 
started learning programming I always wanted to make a task manager, so 
it was an idea that was already in my head, well, kind of. I also felt 
that the Free Software community lacked a good app for students, to help 
us manage our time and tasks, so an app like LibreHomework was a good 
target.</p> 
<p>
LibreHomework is an open-source tool made for students by students. It 
can schedule tasks, exams, organise your documents and lock your device 
screen to help you focus on your tasks.
</p>
	
<p><strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Are there some 
special functions in the application?
</p>	
		
<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Héctor</span></strong>: The lock 
 your screen function. It basically blocks the user from accessing the 
 computer until a button is pressed or a timer finishes. It is achieved 
 by putting the app in full screen and setting it “always on top”. It is 
 not 100% effective but for someone with little to no knowledge of 
 programming/computers it’s more than enough. In fact, making it more 
 secure would imply making the app more aggressive on a system/kernel 
 level.</p>
<p>
LibreHomework will also be able to send you reminders. This is achieved 
by the daemon, written in Rust. It is a completely different program 
from the app and it’s not so well integrated yet, so it is a milestone.
</p>
	
<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: What is your favourite function?
</p>	
		
<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Héctor</span></strong>:I don’t 
 really have one because the app is supposed to be useful with all of 
 them, but if I have to choose one I’ll choose the network/server. It’s 
 completely coded and running, but the User Interface is not done yet, 
 so it’s planned for the near future.
</p>
	
<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Now that we 
 have learned more about your projects, what kind of problems have both 
 of you encountered during the coding period?
 </p>
<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Leonardo</span></strong>: I would 
 say I encountered many problems during the coding phase: some minor 
 ones that could have been easily solved with a quick search on Stack 
 Overflow. Some others took me several days and a lot of effort to be 
 fixed.</p>
<p>
Actually, the majority of the issues I faced from the latter category 
were related with AppWrite: the open-source backend I adopted to replace 
Google Firebase. I didn't know AppWrite before starting Presents 2.0, 
and I learned using their official documentation during this 
competition. But, even so it has strong and well-done documentations, 
AppWrite is missing all the "unofficial resources" like articles, video 
tutorials, and so on that other proprietary backends can count on and 
that make life for beginner-programmers like me way easier.</p>
<p>
That's why, I started thinking about writing a series of articles about 
my experience with AppWrite, why I find it a great alternative to Google 
Firebase, and how to use it as a backend for your next Flutter app.
</p>
	
<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Héctor</span></strong>: A lot of 
 bugs as expected. Some of them were really weird but I ended up solving 
 them with some technical help. I also faced some decisions about the 
 design or the network’s security, so I hope they didn’t backfire.</p>
	
<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Despite these 
 challenges, will you continue to work on your project?
 </p>

<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#ce6d33">Héctor</span></strong>: Yes, there 
 are some planned things and they are specified in the README: managing 
 exams/documents, finishing the network’s tab, integrating the daemon, 
 and making the project available in more languages.</p>

<p>
<strong><span style="color:#d0f400">Leonardo</span></strong>:I am 
continuously working on Presents, and I will keep on doing it since I 
don't see it just as a project for a competition but as an actual app 
that could help many people during their daily life. Up until now, the 
development has been focused on bridging the gap between version 1 and 2 
in terms of functionalities and availability. As soon as this gap won't 
exist any more, Presents 2.0 will replace its ancestor both on the app 
stores and on the website. Then I will start working on some new 
features, hopefully following also community's suggestions (that by the 
way I'm always happy to accept and discuss in the Issues page of <a 
href="https://codeberg.org/LezSoft/Presents">the project repository on 
Codeberg</a>).
</p>
	
<p>
 <strong><span style="color:#3394ce">FSFE</span></strong>: Thank you for 
 your time and we wish you good luck with your next steps.
