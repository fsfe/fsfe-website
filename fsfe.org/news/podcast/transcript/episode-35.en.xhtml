00:00:40,000 --&gt; 00:00:43,600
Hello and welcome to the software freedom podcast.

10
00:00:43,600 --&gt; 00:00:47,600
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

11
00:00:47,600 --&gt; 00:00:52,200
We are a charity that empowers users to take control of technology.

12
00:00:52,200 --&gt; 00:00:55,400
I'm Bonnie Mehring and I'm here with my colleague Alex.

13
00:00:55,400 --&gt; 00:00:56,400
Hi, Bonnie.

14
00:00:56,400 --&gt; 00:00:57,400
Nice to meet you.

15
00:00:58,400 --&gt; 00:01:01,400
Your sentence, Alex.

16
00:01:01,400 --&gt; 00:01:08,400
Oh, so yeah, so I'm I like doing the policy work for the FSFE foundation Europe and

17
00:01:08,400 --&gt; 00:01:15,400
yeah, you'll be already had several episodes on policy work and today we will share some

18
00:01:15,400 --&gt; 00:01:18,000
insights in the latest road, which happened in the youth in parliament.

19
00:01:18,000 --&gt; 00:01:23,400
So I'm really looking forward to this episode to follow up on the tech in your report from

20
00:01:23,400 --&gt; 00:01:30,400
the parliament, but also other upcoming votes that will be handled in the parliament in the

21
00:01:30,400 --&gt; 00:01:31,400
next weeks.

22
00:01:31,400 --&gt; 00:01:32,400
Thank you.

23
00:01:32,400 --&gt; 00:01:38,600
So as you already said, there's a lot going on, Alex, but as happening currently, there

24
00:01:38,600 --&gt; 00:01:43,000
are several votes coming up in the European institutions.

25
00:01:43,000 --&gt; 00:01:45,400
Can you provide us an overview?

26
00:01:45,400 --&gt; 00:01:46,400
Absolutely.

27
00:01:46,400 --&gt; 00:01:53,400
A few weeks ago, we already talked about tech sovereignty, own initiative report from the

28
00:01:53,400 --&gt; 00:01:58,400
European parliament, which happened in the industry committee, the each committee of the European

29
00:01:58,400 --&gt; 00:01:59,400
parliament.

30
00:01:59,400 --&gt; 00:02:04,400
This report was discussed and a vote happened yesterday in the committee.

31
00:02:04,400 --&gt; 00:02:10,400
We will discuss this in detail in a second, which then also means there is an upcoming plan

32
00:02:10,400 --&gt; 00:02:17,400
report on this for seen most likely this month's latest beginning of July because then the

33
00:02:17,400 --&gt; 00:02:25,400
parliament is going into the summer break and normally in particular in months of June, beginning

34
00:02:25,400 --&gt; 00:02:31,400
of July, are very important in the parliament since these are the weeks before a longer summer

35
00:02:31,400 --&gt; 00:02:32,400
break.

36
00:02:32,400 --&gt; 00:02:38,400
And that's normally a lot of reports are pushed to plenary to get a final vote on this to

37
00:02:38,400 --&gt; 00:02:40,400
have this done before the summer break.

38
00:02:40,400 --&gt; 00:02:42,400
And this is also too far to topics we are working on.

39
00:02:42,400 --&gt; 00:02:47,400
So we have this tech sovereignty report, which I just mentioned, but there will be also another

40
00:02:47,400 --&gt; 00:02:52,400
own initiative procedure from the European parliament on procurement.

41
00:02:52,400 --&gt; 00:02:58,400
And procurement is, yeah, absolutely important for us since we are running our public money, public

42
00:02:58,400 --&gt; 00:03:03,400
code campaign since a couple of years where we demand together with other organizations and even

43
00:03:03,400 --&gt; 00:03:09,400
administration to publish software under a free software license if it's paid this taxpayers

44
00:03:09,400 --&gt; 00:03:10,400
money.

45
00:03:10,400 --&gt; 00:03:15,400
And this principle is something we want to transfer into procurement rules.

46
00:03:15,400 --&gt; 00:03:21,400
European wide and as the European commission just recently also had a consultation on this

47
00:03:21,400 --&gt; 00:03:26,400
topic where we also participated and pointing to this issues.

48
00:03:26,400 --&gt; 00:03:31,400
The European parliament also want to before the commission comes up with this proposal, give some

49
00:03:31,400 --&gt; 00:03:32,400
comments.

50
00:03:32,400 --&gt; 00:03:36,400
And so to say red lines and demands to the commission, this is an initiative procedure report

51
00:03:36,400 --&gt; 00:03:37,400
they are doing.

52
00:03:37,400 --&gt; 00:03:44,400
And so this ought to be voted in June or beginning of July, so the committee vote is expected

53
00:03:44,400 --&gt; 00:03:45,400
to be in June.

54
00:03:45,400 --&gt; 00:03:51,400
And so that's I expect that there will also be a final decision on this report before the summer

55
00:03:51,400 --&gt; 00:03:52,400
break.

56
00:03:52,400 --&gt; 00:03:56,400
And I said both reports are own initiative reports.

57
00:03:56,400 --&gt; 00:04:00,400
So they do not really have like any legal effect.

58
00:04:00,400 --&gt; 00:04:06,400
It's not laws, but it's basically demands the parliament is put into words to commission and the

59
00:04:06,400 --&gt; 00:04:09,400
member states to get active in this field.

60
00:04:09,400 --&gt; 00:04:15,400
So this is happening this month and as it is happening in two very important topics for us.

61
00:04:15,400 --&gt; 00:04:17,400
One is technological sovereignty.

62
00:04:17,400 --&gt; 00:04:22,400
And as you said, our mission statement is to empower users to control technology.

63
00:04:22,400 --&gt; 00:04:26,400
This is absolutely contributing to our like core topics we are working on.

64
00:04:26,400 --&gt; 00:04:29,400
So to very important reports.

65
00:04:29,400 --&gt; 00:04:35,400
But also like what is going to follow up then afterwards, which we then also can pretty much discuss

66
00:04:35,400 --&gt; 00:04:40,400
in the end of the podcast what is happening with these reports and how is it going to continue

67
00:04:40,400 --&gt; 00:04:42,400
in the next pretty much like four years.

68
00:04:42,400 --&gt; 00:04:45,400
I'd say in the European Union with these two talks.

69
00:04:45,400 --&gt; 00:04:49,400
You already mentioned they are discussed in a committee.

70
00:04:49,400 --&gt; 00:04:54,400
I think last episode, we already talked a bit about committees, but can you walk us a

71
00:04:54,400 --&gt; 00:05:00,400
bit through this process here that's happening because there is now the vote on the order of

72
00:05:00,400 --&gt; 00:05:05,400
also vote on the tech in technological sovereignty.

73
00:05:05,400 --&gt; 00:05:09,400
Any and there will also be another vote in also a committee.

74
00:05:09,400 --&gt; 00:05:14,400
Can you tell us which one and can you tell us a bit more about those committees?

75
00:05:14,400 --&gt; 00:05:15,400
Absolutely.

76
00:05:15,400 --&gt; 00:05:18,400
So a parliament is organized normally.

77
00:05:18,400 --&gt; 00:05:23,400
And this is what you also see in television that there's a very big room.

78
00:05:23,400 --&gt; 00:05:25,400
And then you'll see people voting there.

79
00:05:25,400 --&gt; 00:05:28,400
And this normally is the plenary. So this is the room.

80
00:05:28,400 --&gt; 00:05:34,400
Also physically, where all members of the parliament come together and have like when they have the first

81
00:05:34,400 --&gt; 00:05:38,400
second concert reading of something where they go and vote.

82
00:05:38,400 --&gt; 00:05:43,400
And to prepare these votes and to do the groundwork so to say.

83
00:05:43,400 --&gt; 00:05:46,400
All parliament are normally organized in committees.

84
00:05:46,400 --&gt; 00:05:51,400
And these committees are focusing on specific topics.

85
00:05:51,400 --&gt; 00:05:59,400
So for example, the industry or consumer protection or health or environment and so on and so forth.

86
00:05:59,400 --&gt; 00:06:03,400
So these committees are there to prepare the final vote and the parliament.

87
00:06:03,400 --&gt; 00:06:08,400
And by thus to prepare a decision, which is then coming from the parliament.

88
00:06:08,400 --&gt; 00:06:18,400
And so this is basically the way how the parliament is trying to address demands or legal text or something like this.

89
00:06:18,400 --&gt; 00:06:20,400
So they call this a report.

90
00:06:20,400 --&gt; 00:06:25,400
So these committees then write a report, push this report to the plenary.

91
00:06:25,400 --&gt; 00:06:35,400
This report is then voted by the plenary and then ultimately we have text which needs to be discussed in a tri-log with the commission and the council to get law.

92
00:06:35,400 --&gt; 00:06:39,400
And this report is like this initiative procedure, which we just mentioned.

93
00:06:39,400 --&gt; 00:06:49,400
Then the parliament is just transferring these documents to the related institutions, normally the council and the commission to ask them to get active on something.

94
00:06:49,400 --&gt; 00:06:53,400
And these reports are also organized in a specific way.

95
00:06:53,400 --&gt; 00:07:03,400
So you have so called the rapporteurs and shuttle rapporteurs, which means you have from every group in the parliament one person being in charge of this report.

96
00:07:03,400 --&gt; 00:07:11,400
And the rapporteurs so to say the leading one who is there to come up with compromises and find majorities in the votes.

97
00:07:11,400 --&gt; 00:07:15,400
So you have a trap report, which is coming from the rapporteur.

98
00:07:15,400 --&gt; 00:07:22,400
The repertoire gives this trap report to the committee where the members of the committee will discuss this.

99
00:07:22,400 --&gt; 00:07:31,400
And based on this discussions, the rapporteur as well as the shuttle rapporteur come together find a compromise and ultimately vote on those.

100
00:07:31,400 --&gt; 00:07:37,400
And this vote then leads to so to say a trap report from the committee.

101
00:07:37,400 --&gt; 00:07:44,400
So this is the position of the committee, which they propose to the plenary to vote on.

102
00:07:44,400 --&gt; 00:07:51,400
So normally this then also means if you give it to a bigger group or larger group, then there might be people saying, are you forgot about this?

103
00:07:51,400 --&gt; 00:07:59,400
You forgot about this since you are the industry committee, but we have some other remarks on this or some other remarks on that.

104
00:07:59,400 --&gt; 00:08:10,400
So we have a table so called amendments to this and they also will be voted and based off this final vote, you then have a report which reflects the position of the opinion parliament.

105
00:08:10,400 --&gt; 00:08:27,400
So this is the procedure and this is also the role of the committees is tax or relative report we are talking about is handled in the industry committee eater, while the procurement any report is handled in the info committee, which is the internal market and consumer protection.

106
00:08:28,400 --&gt; 00:08:32,400
All right, thank you very much for the insights.

107
00:08:32,400 --&gt; 00:08:44,400
Yeah, there is a site check that is even a book about the procedures in the parliament and this is a couple of front pages long so and you should be familiar with these rules.

108
00:08:44,400 --&gt; 00:08:55,400
At least with the core rules and normally you also learn about a new rule, which it hasn't discovered yet with every new file since there is always something unique to it.

109
00:08:55,400 --&gt; 00:08:58,400
Oh, it's regulated.

110
00:08:58,400 --&gt; 00:09:04,400
Okay, well, reading 100 pages is quite a toss ahead.

111
00:09:04,400 --&gt; 00:09:14,400
I'm happy that we are discussing this and that we bring this information in a more transportable way or at least understandable way, I hope.

112
00:09:14,400 --&gt; 00:09:16,400
Yeah, hopefully.

113
00:09:17,400 --&gt; 00:09:30,400
Okay, so this technological serenity any we have already discussed in our previous episode and this was now voted on have they been major changes in the last weeks.

114
00:09:30,400 --&gt; 00:09:33,400
Yeah, have been major changes.

115
00:09:33,400 --&gt; 00:09:41,400
One could say that was one major change and this major change led to the situation that the whole text was changed.

116
00:09:41,400 --&gt; 00:09:46,400
And as already discussed in our previous episode, but also to recap a bit.

117
00:09:46,400 --&gt; 00:09:51,400
The repertoire for this report, so the one as I just described.

118
00:09:51,400 --&gt; 00:09:57,400
Being more or less in charge of finding a compromise for the parliament is a far right.

119
00:09:57,400 --&gt; 00:10:05,400
Member of the parliament and thus made it a bit tricky to come to compromises to put it in nice roles.

120
00:10:05,400 --&gt; 00:10:15,400
So the repertoire I said is normally the person who presents a draft based on the first discussion in the committee where the repertoire things are.

121
00:10:15,400 --&gt; 00:10:22,400
So this reflects some sort of like my opinion, but it's also a report which is basically seeking for a majority.

122
00:10:22,400 --&gt; 00:10:29,400
So you normally don't go there and say, this is not my private opinion and here you go eat this and all good.

123
00:10:29,400 --&gt; 00:10:33,400
So it should be open to find majorities for these reports, right.

124
00:10:33,400 --&gt; 00:10:39,400
So because as they are downloaded and then you sort of say politically lost.

125
00:10:39,400 --&gt; 00:10:43,400
So but the situation now is a set with the far right.

126
00:10:43,400 --&gt; 00:10:49,400
Member of the parliament is that she proposed the text, which was.

127
00:10:49,400 --&gt; 00:10:51,400
Yeah, that also.

128
00:10:51,400 --&gt; 00:10:58,400
I mean, it was not really a good draft, not only in terms of like that it was filled with.

129
00:10:58,400 --&gt; 00:11:11,400
Yeah, basically her opinions and not majority opinions, but also, yeah, it was like, yeah, not only politically, but also like how you write reports was.

130
00:11:11,400 --&gt; 00:11:16,400
And not looking like that you put a lot of efforts into this.

131
00:11:16,400 --&gt; 00:11:21,400
However, this led to the situation that she was also kind of like isolated.

132
00:11:21,400 --&gt; 00:11:26,400
And so she only basically locked up as the other fascist groups together.

133
00:11:26,400 --&gt; 00:11:38,400
And trying to improve the text while at the same time, the conservatives liberals, screens and social democrats came together.

134
00:11:38,400 --&gt; 00:11:47,400
And yeah, try to still have a saying on this textual entity and like to keep the topic as something which needs to be discussed.

135
00:11:47,400 --&gt; 00:11:57,400
Again, up this like one single compromise amendment, which they put to a vote and basically asking to replace the whole text with new tips.

136
00:11:57,400 --&gt; 00:12:05,400
So and this compromise amendment included, for example, the saying is on the Open Source first policy.

137
00:12:05,400 --&gt; 00:12:11,400
Also talked about other topics, which are not that important for us like undersea cables chips.

138
00:12:11,400 --&gt; 00:12:20,400
They also talked about automotive since the conservatives was in so that there are also some pretty wide ideas in the report.

139
00:12:20,400 --&gt; 00:12:29,400
However, except so the compromise amendment was done and was prepared by these four groups and was presented to vote.

140
00:12:29,400 --&gt; 00:12:37,400
And now we talk again about procedures as a repertoire, you have to chance to step down from your own report.

141
00:12:37,400 --&gt; 00:12:47,400
The reporters normally do this once they see that the report is going in a completely wrong direction from what they personally believe in.

142
00:12:47,400 --&gt; 00:12:55,400
So and that was also what people expected to happen in this vote since basically the report now with this vote happen.

143
00:12:55,400 --&gt; 00:13:01,400
It looked like a report where not a single word is coming from the repertoire.

144
00:13:01,400 --&gt; 00:13:07,400
So even contrary to this, the repertoire also came up with a compromise amendment.

145
00:13:07,400 --&gt; 00:13:17,400
It's so called compromise amendment, which was clear that it is nothing to do with the compromise other than the name, which found no majority.

146
00:13:17,400 --&gt; 00:13:21,400
So there were two amendments tabled.

147
00:13:21,400 --&gt; 00:13:24,400
And the beginning there were like 400 amendments.

148
00:13:24,400 --&gt; 00:13:32,400
So coming from individual members of the committee, right, which is a huge amount for such a new report.

149
00:13:32,400 --&gt; 00:13:43,400
So there you can always see that this was not contributing to the compromise, so to say and based out of these 400 amendments which have been tabled.

150
00:13:43,400 --&gt; 00:13:54,400
And coming from like conservatives, so the Democrats, Greens and Liberals, they said together and said, look, more or less, there are points where we agree on.

151
00:13:54,400 --&gt; 00:14:12,400
And there are other points where we might kind of compromise on, let's sit together and write a new report since it's absolutely impossible to collaborate with her and to find compromise as they have seen, not only by her work, but also since some groups just simply do not want to work together with specials.

152
00:14:12,400 --&gt; 00:14:20,400
That's why they came together based on the individual amendments table to come up as a compromise amendment and this compromise amendment.

153
00:14:20,400 --&gt; 00:14:32,400
Basically, they concluded all these, let's say 200 amendments into one amendment, but basically every sentence she was saying is we delete this sentence and replace it with this sentence.

154
00:14:32,400 --&gt; 00:14:39,400
So that ultimately you came up to the text that was completely new written.

155
00:14:39,400 --&gt; 00:14:51,400
Next to this text, which was put together by this group as a compromise amendment, there was another compromise amendment by fascist parties saying like this is our proposal for a compromise amendment.

156
00:14:51,400 --&gt; 00:15:04,400
So and that would also have like modified the text a lot, but still would have meant that since it was also coming somehow from her that this reflects her position also.

157
00:15:04,400 --&gt; 00:15:18,400
No, since there was another report basically adopted a set not a single word from the repertoire itself is in this report and for this it's absolutely crazy that she still stays on the report.

158
00:15:18,400 --&gt; 00:15:27,400
So we have a fashion repertoire on a report where there is not a single word of the repertoire in this report, but the name.

159
00:15:27,400 --&gt; 00:15:34,400
This report is now pushed with the name and the text of this group into the plenary for a final vote and this is yeah.

160
00:15:34,400 --&gt; 00:15:44,400
I find this very fascinating because like there's nothing of this report reflect her personal opinion or her the opinion of her party anymore.

161
00:15:44,400 --&gt; 00:15:49,400
So why is she still staying on there.

162
00:15:49,400 --&gt; 00:16:02,400
So I mean politically she completely lost so this is absolutely obvious, but maybe she wants to just clown the procedures and ultimately if the report is voted in the in the plenary.

163
00:16:02,400 --&gt; 00:16:18,400
There is the same for example go to the commission and tell them about the report and this is done by the repertoire so ultimately if she stays on the report and it gets majority, then she will be the person representing the parliament towards the commission and counsel telling them about this report.

164
00:16:19,400 --&gt; 00:16:25,400
And this will be a meeting so what she will get out of this is meeting time.

165
00:16:25,400 --&gt; 00:16:31,400
Yeah I see I see so she is gaining politically so to say.

166
00:16:31,400 --&gt; 00:16:50,400
And even so like if you look at her social media profiles then it's also that she is communicating that she's working on textual remedy and she's presenting her report and all this reports is coming with the nice logos of the parliament and everything looks official as it is somehow also official.

167
00:16:50,400 --&gt; 00:17:00,400
And she's just not talking about towards the public about that the report was download that she's just using her draft to promote herself.

168
00:17:00,400 --&gt; 00:17:15,400
And she can easily do this since she is still a repertoire for this so and she's one could say lying towards the public seems she's not pointing to the fact that like her draft was downloaded but since this is still on official paper of the parliament.

169
00:17:15,400 --&gt; 00:17:21,400
It looks to people like this is an official document which is now being in place.

170
00:17:21,400 --&gt; 00:17:27,400
If you don't know precisely about the procedures and how a document should look like if it's coming with the final vote.

171
00:17:27,400 --&gt; 00:17:39,400
You could easily be misleaded by her communications strategy and like following her communication style saying she's working on textual remedy this is her report so she's active on this.

172
00:17:39,400 --&gt; 00:17:46,400
She seems right to have a begging for this since it's coming out of the parliament.

173
00:17:46,400 --&gt; 00:17:48,400
Very interesting.

174
00:17:48,400 --&gt; 00:18:04,400
Yeah so if you don't dig into the details then and if you just like do not put some light on this and then it's easily possible that this person will be able to present herself as someone who finds this position in the opinion parliament on textual run.

175
00:18:04,400 --&gt; 00:18:13,400
And this is basically what she's doing so she's also on conference is giving talks on this presenting basically her trust report and not what was voted.

176
00:18:13,400 --&gt; 00:18:22,400
This is very crazy now but we will keep an eye on this so what happened how is the standing of press offer in this report.

177
00:18:22,400 --&gt; 00:18:36,400
Yeah so I mean first of all again we have to see that this report is basically what's now in the report was not produced so to say under normal circumstances or under normal procedures.

178
00:18:36,400 --&gt; 00:18:46,400
It was pretty much and this could also be criticized I think done behind closed doors to come up with this compromise amendment right so compromise amendments are normally also not public.

179
00:18:46,400 --&gt; 00:19:04,400
They need to be leaked and also it's very hard to see which group fight it for what I mean you can guess I mean if you look at the report I said it's about technological sovereignty so software is one part of it but it also talks about other parts.

180
00:19:04,400 --&gt; 00:19:33,400
Out of the sudden there is some car industry in it so I guess this is coming from the conservatives and maybe even from the liberal so there you can guess but it's really hard to see how text involved and from who it was originally drafted and how did the majorities formed around this during the process so and this is absolutely needed to challenge with debates right and to understand where are majorities and why are they there.

181
00:19:33,400 --&gt; 00:19:55,400
So this just as a background information that you should keep in mind that this is basically already a compromise and not something which was voted might so to say in a normal procedure however part of the compromise and this is absolutely good is that they see the benefits of how what they call Open Source first policy.

182
00:19:55,400 --&gt; 00:20:24,400
And so this is also something what we basically demand is our public money public court campaign as said so we want that taxpayers money is used to come up with the software and not the proprietary software and so this should be the default right so in the first place we procure free software and if this is not possible then you need to explain why this is not possible it needs to be controlled by the court of order this why this is not possible to prove free software.

183
00:20:25,400 --&gt; 00:20:54,400
So and this would be from our perspective so to say like what they call Open Source first policy right so and they see the benefits of this they see this is good for member states if they collaborate it's it's good for innovation it's good for competitiveness so they see all the values which we basically also point towards in our public money public court campaign and mentioned them so which is pretty good and we can see that the parliament understood the benefits.

184
00:20:55,400 --&gt; 00:21:06,400
Of this policy however what they failed is to demand something in this direction right so they just said it's good and that's it so they didn't say to the commission now come up with a law.

185
00:21:06,400 --&gt; 00:21:22,400
And the law should for example have an introduction of the court of auditors there should be statistics on this there should be transparency on this there should be clear guidelines in procurement how to get there and stuff like this so there's there's a

186
00:21:22,400 --&gt; 00:21:51,400
Normally you have in these own initiative reports clear demands so since the parliament can freely speak so to say since this text is not going to end up in law but just basically only demands then you want to come up with a lot of demands since you basically negotiate with the other institutions council and commission if you like and also there you need to compromise and if you start with the week text then it's easier for the other institutions to basically download you if you like.

187
00:21:51,400 --&gt; 00:22:20,400
So in this regard the text at the moment for us is missing some concrete measures so it's coming up with the I'd say some sort of like correct assessment but it's missing concrete actions and this is also what we demanded in our press release that the plenary so I said there will be a plenary road still so this means groups and a larger group of MEPs or even committees can still table amendments to what now the e3 came up with.

188
00:22:20,400 --&gt; 00:22:49,400
And here we are asking MEPs to to table these kind of amendments to also introduce some sort of measures and to be a bit more concrete and what they demand so to basically not only come up with an assessment which is absolutely good and it's also good that they mentioned the world Open Source first policy right so this also helps us in the debate is the commission so it's good that they use this wording however concrete steps are missing and this is now what we are fighting for.

189
00:22:50,400 --&gt; 00:23:19,400
So first of all I'm very happy that the word in Open Source or free software actually made it in into the report because I remember our discussion last time was that we actually feared that it might not be considered or that something clearly as this or clear statement like this will not make it into the report so this I think is something that we can.

190
00:23:19,400 --&gt; 00:23:29,400
I think it's something that we can be very happy about and I guess this is also down to some of our good work.

191
00:23:29,400 --&gt; 00:23:36,400
I think so too.

192
00:23:36,400 --&gt; 00:23:47,400
This is a short break for our own cause thank you for listening to the software freedom podcast working for software freedom and producing podcasts costs money.

193
00:23:47,400 --&gt; 00:23:58,400
So supporting us with a donation on the FSFE dot org/donate and the show notes.

194
00:23:58,400 --&gt; 00:24:08,400
But now we are like we are having the situation that this is going to be compromised properly because there will be another round of discussions.

195
00:24:08,400 --&gt; 00:24:15,400
There's a procedure that will follow up now on this any and we are missing the concrete measurements.

196
00:24:15,400 --&gt; 00:24:23,400
Is there a chance that others can still step in and change this text and add those or is this currently not going to happen.

197
00:24:23,400 --&gt; 00:24:38,400
No, I mean it's it's like from the ether to the plenary now it's transferred from the committee into the plenary and in the plenary it can be modified by a larger group of MEPs I think it's like something around 80 MEPs.

198
00:24:38,400 --&gt; 00:24:46,400
So if they come together and say this is our amendment to improve this in this so to come up for example is the sort of measurement.

199
00:24:46,400 --&gt; 00:24:51,400
Then they can table this amendment and this is also true for communities.

200
00:24:51,400 --&gt; 00:24:59,400
So another community could go there and say look we want to amend it this way or groups that's the pretty much the most normal way.

201
00:24:59,400 --&gt; 00:25:07,400
So that the group like I don't know quite some of the greens are coming and say look we now want to introduce some measures so therefore we came up with this amendment.

202
00:25:07,400 --&gt; 00:25:22,400
And these amendments then will be collected before the vote in the plenary and yeah will be organized by the secretary yet in a way that they can be voted and then basically at every member of parliament votes on these proposals.

203
00:25:22,400 --&gt; 00:25:33,400
And if they find a majority they are in the report and then you have a final vote on the report itself and if this both is like finding a majority.

204
00:25:33,400 --&gt; 00:25:51,400
Then you have a report with this amendment so they're still a chance for the parliament to improve this text and so this could be also achieved by contacting any piece asking them to approve this text.

205
00:25:51,400 --&gt; 00:26:00,400
Do you see that there is a realistic change that this might make it in or is there still this political situation going on.

206
00:26:00,400 --&gt; 00:26:14,400
As you already mentioned Sarah Knavo is still the rapporteur so will there still be a compromise between the other democratic parties or what's happening here.

207
00:26:14,400 --&gt; 00:26:24,400
Yeah so and that's that's one of the key questions right so one of the potential outcomes is that the report is improved with this amendments.

208
00:26:24,400 --&gt; 00:26:33,400
So to say they find majorities to introduce some new measures or whatever or even they just keep the report as it is.

209
00:26:33,400 --&gt; 00:26:42,400
And then they might still download it since the rapporteur is not willing to step down from report.

210
00:26:42,400 --&gt; 00:26:48,400
But it could be a potential outcome that we in the end have text wise and I report.

211
00:26:48,400 --&gt; 00:26:56,400
But which will not find a majority since the rapporteur do not want to be removed from the report.

212
00:26:56,400 --&gt; 00:27:07,400
Also it could happen that the rapporteur sees that it's a bit strange to put the name under such a report and response, then the report will find a majority.

213
00:27:07,400 --&gt; 00:27:26,400
It will be removed and then it's just the report basically by the parliament so if there is there is no authorship and then I'm not fully sure about the procedures but I think the chair of the committee will be then the one who is presenting the report basically towards the council and commission.

214
00:27:26,400 --&gt; 00:27:45,400
But you see there might be a situation that based on the procedures with we come up with a vote which is not looking too much at the text but more online who is on the text and what are the procedures so in this situation where we are and that's pretty hard to predict at the moment.

215
00:27:45,400 --&gt; 00:27:51,400
There are majorities we go so this is also what is going to be discussed between groups at the moment.

216
00:27:51,400 --&gt; 00:28:00,400
So for example, there's some sort of like exchange between on a working level between groups or how will you vote what's happening if we vote like this.

217
00:28:00,400 --&gt; 00:28:07,400
So they are trying to find majorities and raise how to result so and for this nobody has an answer yet.

218
00:28:07,400 --&gt; 00:28:15,400
And I guess we will pretty much only know the answer after the vote so it's definitely a pop conservation.

219
00:28:15,400 --&gt; 00:28:25,400
We are in and it's also very difficult to anticipate the outcomes also since this is the very first time that we have a far right.

220
00:28:25,400 --&gt; 00:28:40,400
We have a member on such a report in this new term between new majorities right so it's also showing a lot and maybe maybe even define a lot of the workflows and how they play the procedures.

221
00:28:40,400 --&gt; 00:28:57,400
And a lot will be visible after this kind of report on how do the fascists play the procedures, how we normally use the procedures and what yeah to what situations this can be and how to reveal this.

222
00:28:57,400 --&gt; 00:29:19,400
So next to and that's why also in this podcast we talk a lot about not free software related topics that they are all still very important for us since also as said, the repertoire is presenting these ideas towards the public so they work on these topics so it's not just that they sit there and do this.

223
00:29:19,400 --&gt; 00:29:34,400
No, no, they also go towards a public and trying to frame it that way they see it so and this is also something which we have to understand they work on this topic is a reality is something so the serenity have it even in their name right.

224
00:29:34,400 --&gt; 00:29:44,400
So it's a debate they are pretty much interested in and they have a pretty national views in this debate so and this is something we should be aware of.

225
00:29:44,400 --&gt; 00:30:11,400
And maybe also need to make sure that the pine majorities that are possible without fascists and this is also something what we have seen so it's on the other hand, good to see that the conservatives did not went to the far right and trying to compromise with them but went to the social democrats, greens, liberals trying to finally compromise with them.

226
00:30:11,400 --&gt; 00:30:27,400
Yeah, absolutely I can I find this very very positive to be honest because it shows that some of the democratic parties come together and they work together on this and I find this very empowering.

227
00:30:27,400 --&gt; 00:30:48,400
Absolutely, absolutely, but it's also a set there are some points to it where we also need to say look it's good that you are working together, but if you then undermine democratic procedures and this is also the so one has to be very careful with this procedure game, this is what I want to say and also it's not over yet.

228
00:30:48,400 --&gt; 00:31:13,400
So it might fail in the plenary vote and what do we do then so and this is what I mean it's kind of like a pop consideration and really hard to say what's the outcome in the next week a lot can move so like politics is it can be very fluid and I just believe this group will be successful if they are successful right so it still can happen that one of these.

229
00:31:13,400 --&gt; 00:31:35,400
Like amendments that I just mentioned is going to be table to improve the text where maybe the conservatives vote together with the far right so this is something where we what we don't know yet and this is something also we have to wait for to see what are the amendments they are coming up so and where are ultimately majorities around these amendments this is still all to come.

230
00:31:35,400 --&gt; 00:31:41,400
And this is something we definitely work on where we have an eye on that's also by a guest we will have.

231
00:31:41,400 --&gt; 00:31:59,400
First let me ask you first when is the plenary vote scheduled or is there already a time for you to get you but the set I mean the summer break is just about to come and the last plenary session is beginning of July and it's very likely that it will happen in this.

232
00:31:59,400 --&gt; 00:32:08,400
Months plenary vote all latest in July in the plenary session so before the summer it's very likely that we will have results on.

233
00:32:08,400 --&gt; 00:32:15,400
Thank you Alex thank you so much for the insights but in light of the time and as I want to keep it short.

234
00:32:15,400 --&gt; 00:32:24,400
I would say we pull up on this and we see what's happening and I'm very curious to see this political game play out.

235
00:32:24,400 --&gt; 00:32:41,400
Absolutely so I said I'm also super interested and happy to continue this conversation with you and the podcast maybe if our dear listeners have any feedback from us I think that would be also very welcome so in terms of like how understandable is this how interesting is this for you.
