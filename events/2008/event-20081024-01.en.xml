	For 2008, FSCONS is a collaboration of FSFE, Creative Commons,
	and Wikimedia Sweden.  There will be three tracks (Free
	Culture, Free Software, Free Content), each lead by one of the
	main organisers.  Topics will range from modern kernel design
	over citizen journalism all the way across to licensing in the
	21st century.
