	<h1> ❤ Let's celebrate together the next I Love Free Software Day!</h1>
	
	<p> 
	Every 14th of February, people around the world celebrate the 
	“I Love Free Software Day”.  On this day we show our love for Free 
	Software and thank all the people contributing to software freedom. 
	This year, we are organising a whole event dedicated to Free 
	Software games.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
	Although many of us depend on Free Software every day, 
	contributors to those projects usually remain invisible. This is 
	one of the main reasons that drive us to celebrate this day. We 
	want to highlight the valuable work of all the people who 
	contribute to software freedom, and take the time to say thank 
	you!</p> 
	
	<p>There are three different ways you can join us for this 
	celebration. Spoiler alert: all of them are a lot of fun!

	<p>
	For the <a href="/activities/ilovefs/">I Love Free Software Day 
	2022</a>, we have prepared something special and fun for you: an event 
	dedicated to Free Software games. The event takes place online on 
	14 February 2022 at 18:00-20:00 CET. For the first part of our 
	event, our three expert guests in Free Software games, game 
	engines, and Game Jams will share their experiences, and will 
	immerse us in the world of Free Software games. After this, we 
	invite you to play <a href="https://veloren.net/">Veloren</a> with 
	us.
	</p> 
	
	<p>
	For technical reasons, we are asking people who want to 
	take part in the whole event via our BigBlueButton instance to <a 
	href="https://registration.fsfe.org/ilovefs">register</a> in 
	advance (registration is now closed). The number of participants in this instance is limited.
	But, do not worry if you do not want to register or if you are too 
	late to do so. The talks will be <a href="https://stream.fsfe.org">streamed online</a>, and you will be 
	able to watch them without registration.  You just won&#39;t be 
	able to join us for the second part of the event in which we will be 
	playing games together.
	</p>

	<p>
	You can also celebrate the I Love Free Software Day by sending a 
	thank you message to your favourite Free Software project for their 
	valuable work. You can do this, for example, on your preferred 
	social network with the hashtag #ilovefs. If you prefer images over 
	words, please use our brand new <a 
	href="https://sharepic.fsfe.org/">Sharepic Generator</a> to create 
	your very own pictures. It is simple to use and you have a nice 
	graphic to share in two minutes. Let your imagination run free and 
	show your appreciation for Free Software with an #ilovefs image.
