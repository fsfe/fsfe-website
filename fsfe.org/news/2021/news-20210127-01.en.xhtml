<h1>EU should enable reusability of software to extend usage lifetimes of devices</h1>

  <p>
	We gave feedback to the EU consultation about "Energy labelling of 
	mobile phones and tablets". Access to hardware, permission to 
	replace the operating system of the device, and publication of the 
	code are key to make phones last longer. 
  </p>

  <p>
	  In December 2020, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12798-Energy-labelling-of-mobile-phones-and-tablets-informing-consumers-about-environmental-impact/F1465695_en">EU 
	  consultation about "Energy labelling of mobile phones and 
	  tablets"</a> opened for feedback, and on 27 January 2021 the 
	  FSFE submitted its contribution. The consultation is part of a 
	  current revisal on the European Ecodesign regulation, aiming to 
	  ensure that:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>mobile phones and tablets are designed to be energy efficient and durable</li>
    <li>consumers can easily repair, upgrade and maintain these devices</li>
    <li>circular economy models are provided with possible reuse and recycling of devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
	  The FSFE <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12798-Energy-labelling-of-mobile-phones-and-tablets-informing-consumers-about-environmental-impact/F1465695_en">responded</a> 
	  to the initiative.

  <p>
	  90% or more of the overall resource and energy consumption in the 
	  lifetime of nowadays smartphones and tablets incur by their 
	  production and global transport but less than 10% by their actual 
	  usage time. Thus, extending usage lifetime of produced mobile 
	  phones and tablets (hereafter together addressed as “phones”) is 
	  key to lower their environmental impact. 
  </p>
  <p>
	  When the manufacturing company stops supporting the software of 
	  past devices, the user is not in a position to use the device 
	  without security risks. However, the hardware is in good 
	  condition. This is planned obsolescence, a practice that affects 
	  software. The problem is artificially created by manufacturers to 
	  raise sales of new phones instead of letting consumers keep using 
	  the old ones.
  </p>
  <p>
	  One solution to the problem would be to enforce a guaranteed 
	  minimal support-time of security updates by manufacturers. But 
	  even more helpful in the long run would be the obligation to 
	  <strong>publish the code</strong> under a Free Software license 
	  if no more security support is or can be provided.
  </p>
  <p>
	  It should be reminded that manufacturers prevent the users from 
	  fixing the device too. Preventions include technical measures, 
	  for example locking the bootloader, and legal measures, for 
	  example threatening to void your warranty by flashing a Custom 
	  Rom on your device.
  </p>

  <p>
	  The Commission must ensure any customer’s full right to their own 
	  hardware including <strong>access to the bootloader</strong> and 
	  the <strong>ability to replace the operating system</strong> at 
	  will. Without planned obsolescence, smartphones can last longer 
	  and the devices can be repurposed. Respecting the users' 
	  right to repair is a sustainable solution. Repairing our devices 
	  instead of buying new ones is an environmentally friendly 
	  behaviour.
  </p>
  <p>
	  Finally, these decisions can have significant financial benefits 
	  for small businesses and for the European tech industry. Offering 
	  consumer’s the right to their own hardware and extend its usage 
	  lifetimes via third-party service providers will help to open up 
	  a sector currently heavily dominated by monopolies outside 
	  Europe.
