          Android is a <a
          href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html">mostly
          free</a> operating system mainly developed by Google. Unfortunately,
          the drivers for most devices and most applications from the "market"
          are not free as in freedom. They frequently work against the interest
          of the users, spy on them and sometimes can not even be removed. This
          campaign can help you to <strong>regain control</strong> of your
          Android device and your data. It collects information about running an
          Android system as free as possible and tries to coordinate the efforts
          in this area.

      <h3>Freedom and Control</h3>
      
      <p>
        Smart-phones are small computers that we carry around all the time. Most
        smart-phones are not controlled by the users, but by the manufacturer
        and the operator. The software that runs on them is not Free Software.
        Even Android phones ship with non-free software and proprietary add-ons
        that usually do not work in the full interest of the user. Software
        updates will only be made available when the manufacturer still has a
        commercial interest in your device. The applications (apps) available
        from the official market are most of the time non-free. Nobody is
        allowed to study how they work and what they really do on your phone.
        Sometimes they just don't work exactly as you want, but sometimes they
        even contain malicious features.
      </p>

      <p>
        Running only Free Software on your device puts you in full control. Even
        though you might not be able to directly exercise all of your freedom,
        you will benefit from a vibrant community that can do it together.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      
      <p>
        Our mobile devices contain more personal information than most private
        diaries. But proprietary systems, even most Android phones, are designed
        to leave this data in control of companies like Google or Apple. Most
        users do not have full control over the personal data on their device.
        Convenient solutions for cloud-based synchronization and data backup
        trick more and more people into storing all their data on centralized
        servers run by some commercial organisation. Whoever has personal
        information about us is able to manipulate us. Therefore non-free
        devices are a threat to democracy and our society. 
      </p>
      
      <p> 
        Privacy is one of the most important reasons to support Free Software.
        Proprietary add-ons like <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_IQ">Carrier IQ</a> spy on
        smart-phone users without their knowledge. Many apps from the market
        contain malicious features. They read your private data and "phone
        home", or they use <a
        href="https://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/mobile/android.html#overview">Google
        Analytics</a> to send data to Google. These are just examples that have
        been discovered so far. The lack of freedom impedes independent
        inspection and secret spy features only become known by accident.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most smart-phones require you to connect and identify yourself to a
        centralized server before you can use them properly. Users have to trust
        the server without knowing what information is stored and how it is
        processed or related to other data. A phone running only Free Software
        does not require you to provide data to an untrustworthy company or
        pressure you to do so - at least this is very unlikely, as the
        software's actions would be obvious and the community would be able to
        develop an alternative version. The convenience of "value-added"
        services that are often coupled with such connections can be provided
        using Free Software as well. This keeps you in control of your personal
        data, your diary remains in your possession. You can have the cake and
        eat it too.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="OS">The Operating Systems</h2>
      
      <p> 
        An operating system is a collection of software that enables you to use
        your phone and run other applications on it. Even though Android is <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html">mostly
        free</a>, many phones ship with proprietary components and add-ons. Some
        phones also have a locked <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting#Boot_loader">boot loader</a>
        which prevents you from booting and installing other operating systems.
        If you want to buy an Android phone, make sure that the boot loader can
        be <a
        href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/?search=&quot;unlock+bootloader&quot;">unlocked</a>.
        On some devices it can only be unlocked with clever hacks. There are
        also companies that ship their devices with an unlocked bootloader or
        provide you with the means to unlock it. Besides that, it is a good idea
        to check if there are free versions of Android <a
        href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices">supporting the device</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Replicant OS</h3>
      
      <p>
        <a href="http://replicant.us/">Replicant</a> is a distribution of
        Android that is 100% Free Software. It runs only on <a
        href="http://replicant.us/supported-phones/">a very limited number of
        devices</a>. If you have one of these devices, then this is your choice.
      </p>
      
      <h3>CyanogenMod</h3>
      
      <div class="image right" style="padding-bottom: 0pt">
        <img alt="CyanogenMod" src="/campaigns/android/cyanogenmod.png" />
      </div>
      
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">CyanogenMod</a> is the most
        popular aftermarket distribution for Android. It <a
        href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices">runs on many phones</a> and
        offers <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/about/features">features</a>
        not found in the official Android based firmwares of vendors. It also
        ships without Google applications and gives you more freedom over your
        device. CyanogenMod is Free Software developed by an active community.
        It still requires 
        <a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_semc_iyokan/blob/gingerbread/proprietary-files.txt">non-free
        device drivers and firmware</a> which are 
        <a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_semc_iyokan/blob/gingerbread/extract-files.sh">fetched
        from a device</a> and are included in the ROM.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In order to install CyanogenMod, your device's boot loader needs to be
        unlocked. Some manufacturers consider your warranty void when you've
        unlocked its boot loader. The <a
        href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Main_Page">Wiki of
        CyanogenMod</a> contains detailed instructions on how to install it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        After the installation, your phone will be freed from all those
        pre-installed proprietary applications and there will be no need to
        connect your phone with a Google account. With the exception of some
        non-free device drivers, your phone should run only Free Software. If
        you know about non-free software added to CyanogenMod, please <a
        href="mailto:android&#64;lists.fsfe.org">let us know</a> about it! There
        is a DRM provider app that you can <a
        href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Barebones">remove</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="Apps">The Apps</h2>
      
      <p>
        For most people, the <a href="https://market.android.com/">Google
        Android Market</a> is the only or the main source for their
        applications. It doesn't even tell you whether an app is Free Software
        or not, let alone its license. Unfortunately, most apps from this or
        other markets are proprietary. Even if you install a Free Software app,
        there is no reason to trust the downloaded binary. Using the Google
        Market also requires a Google account. It is recommended to not use this
        market at all.
      </p>

      <h3>F-Droid</h3>

      <div class="image" style="padding-right: 1em">
        <img alt="F-Droid" src="/campaigns/android/f-droid.png" />
      </div>

      <p>
        The <a href="http://f-droid.org/">F-Droid initiative</a> was started to
        change the sad Free Software app situation in the Android world. It
        builds a repository of easily-installable Free Software for the Android
        platform. There is an Android client application that makes it easy to
        browse Free Software applications, install them onto your device, and
        keep track of updates. When available it includes information about how
        to donate money to the authors of the app.
      </p>

      <p>
        The F-Droid repository contains details of multiple versions of each
        application. You can also easily create and add own repositories. But
        since the initiative is <a
        href="https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidserver">very active</a>,
        developing in a decentralized fashion and open to collaboration,
        creating own repositories it not really necessary. Its goal is to
        include all useful Free Software Android applications and to keep up
        with their updates.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can help to make F-Droid <a
        href="https://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=3789">preinstalled
        on CyanogenMod</a> so more people can benefit from a free market.
      </p>

      <h4>Adding Apps Yourself</h4>

      <p>
        You are encouraged to add applications yourself. There is a long queue
        of <a
        href="http://f-droid.org/forums/forum/submission-queue/">applications
        that wait to be added</a>. Adding them works similar to <a
        href="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html">FreeBSD ports</a> and <a
        href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/handbook/handbook.xml?part=2&amp;chap=1#doc_chap2">gentoo
        ebuilds</a> by filling a simple recipe file which controls how a package
        is build from source. If you like to add apps yourself, you should read
        about <a
        href="http://f-droid.org/forums/topic/adding-apps-with-git/">how F-Droid
        works with git</a> and <a
        href="https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroidserver/blobs/master/README">how
        to write these so called metadata files</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Synchronizing Your Data</h4>

      <p>
        When you run only Free Software and when you do not rely on non-free
        network services like the ones Google offers, you lose the convenience
        of synchronizing your contacts, your calender and other data with your
        other devices. Fortunately, there is plenty of Free Software that does
        this job as well:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://acal.me/">ACal</a> synchronizes your Android
          addressbook and calendar to <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a>/<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV">CardDAV</a> servers like
          <a href="http://owncloud.org/">ownCloud</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://code.google.com/p/kolab-android/">kolab-android</a>
          synchronizes your Android addressbook and calendar to <a
          href="http://www.kolab.org/">Kolab</a>/IMAP folders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
          href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Howto:_Connect_to_Device_with_SSH">SSH
          Daemon dropbear</a> is pre-installed on CyanogenMod and can be used to
          e.g. run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="FreeingApps">Freeing Non-Free Apps</h3>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, there are still some applications that do not have a free
        alternative. To use the proprietary app is a bad idea; it takes away
        your freedom. In addition, if you settle into using the non-free
        program, you won't feel the need for it to be free. Even if you don't
        know how to program, you can <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/ConvinceYourFriends">contact</a> the authors
        of crucial apps and <a href="https://fsfe.pad.foebud.org/en-android">ask
        them politely</a> for their reasons for not publishing their app as Free
        Software. Many apps are available without payments, so money is not
        always the dominating reason. Sometimes one email can make a difference
        and there have already been successful attempts: <a
        href="https://market.android.com/details?id=cz.hejl.chesswalk">Chess
        Walk</a> for example is now <a
        href="https://gitorious.org/chesswalk/chesswalk">liberated</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Apps That Still Need To Be Liberated</h4>

      <p>
        We collect apps that have no free counterpart, but are important to have
        on a free system <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Android#Apps_That_Still_Need_To_Be_Liberated">in
        our wiki</a>. Please add other essential apps there. People can <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/ConvinceYourFriends">contact the authors</a>
        of those apps and ask them why they are not Free Software.
      </p>

      <h4>Responses to Objections We've Heard from App Developers</h4>

      <p>
        Only when we understand the motivation of programmers who keep their
        apps proprietary, we know what needs to be changed in order to change
        their minds and to convince them of liberating their own app. Please <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Android#Responses_to_Objections_We.27ve_Heard_from_App_Developers">contribute
        your experiences</a> with developers of non-free apps here and <a
        href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Android#Responses_to_Objections_We.27ve_Heard_from_App_Developers">share
        useful responses</a> to their objections.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Objection:</strong> If I publish my app as Free Software, I
          will not be able to make money with it. 
          <ul> 
            <li> You can still offer your app in other markets and ask for money
            there. </li> 
            <li> Offer options for people to donate. Free markets
            like F-Droid can include them and their users like to reward.
            Depending on your case, you might make more money with donations
            than from sales. </li> 
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Objection:</strong> But when my app is Free Software other
          people can distribute it without me getting profit. 
          <ul> 
            <li> That is true, but keep in mind that people who don't want to
            pay you will always find ways to do so. </li> 
            <li> If you ask people
            in a friendly non-obtrusive way and give them good reasons, they
            will give you money. </li> 
            <li> In case other people distribute your
            app without charge over markets, there are ways to stop that.
            Talking to the distributor or the market operator is one way. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Objection:</strong> I'm embarrassed by my bad code and don't
          want anybody to see it (from <a
          href="http://blog.flattr4android.com/?p=52">Flattr4Android</a>). 
          <ul>
            <li> Your code is very useful to many people and it works. Of course
            good code would be better, but code quality is secondary to freedom.
            </li> 
            <li> Everybody wrote bad code at some point. Sharing it will
            enable others to help you improving it. </li> 
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Other Related Initiatives</h2>

      <p>
        Even though this campaign is about Android, there are other important
        initiatives that also have the goal to allow you using small mobile
        computers in freedom. There is the spiritual Openmoko continuation <a
        href="http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-main/">GTA04 from Golden
        Delicious</a>. It builds a free phone without the need for proprietary
        drivers. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maemo">Maemo</a>/<a
        href="https://meego.com/">MeeGo</a> initiative has now moved into <a

        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen">Tizen</a> and tries to be an
        alternative free operating system. Also WebOS is <a
        href="http://developer.palm.com/blog/2011/12/open-source/">about to be
        liberated</a>.
