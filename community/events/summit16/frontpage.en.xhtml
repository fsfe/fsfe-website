    <h1>FSFE summit 2016 - September 2nd to 4th, BCC Berlin, Germany</h1>

	<p><em>Imagine a European Union that builds its IT infrastructure on Free Software. Imagine European Member States that exchange information in Open Standards and share their software. Imagine municipalities and city councils that benefit from decentralized and collaborative software under free licenses. Imagine no European is any longer forced to use non-Free Software.</em></p>

	<p>This is what we are seeking. And although this vision feels like a long road to go, we know that we are taking major steps along it today. To help unlock our full potential on this road, FSFE offers cross-border collaboration and its first European summit. Be part of it and join our movement.</p>
