	<h2 id="savecodeshare">Tell EU to Save Code Share in the current EU Copyright debate!</h2>

		 <p newsteaser="yes">EU is currently revising its copyright rules for them to be more adapted for modern digital age in its proposal for the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0593">EU Copyright Directive in the Digital Single Market</a>. Instead of recognising the realities of how different content is being shared online, the current EU Copyright Directive proposal, and in particular its Article 13 targeted at online hosting providers, <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2017/news-20171005-01.en.html">threatens</a> our ability to access public code repositories and share code online. The new rules enshrined in Article 13 intend to introduce new obligations for code hosting platforms in order to prevent any possible copyright infringement, otherwise platforms will end up being directly liable for their users' activity. Article 13, thus, imposes the use of costly upload filters in order to identify allegedly infringing code. The problem with such requirement is that there are no known  automated filters that can accurately identify whether the code is shared adequately and without breaching a respective Free Software licence. In addition, Article 13 imposes a far-reaching monitoring obligation on code hosting platforms to actively seek for infringing activity by their users. In scope, proposed Article 13 treat every user of code hosting platform a potential copyright infringer whose content, including the whole code repositories, may be taken down or prevented to be uploaded to the platform at any time. If code gets so easily  "unpublished", this can severely hamper all the other software built on top of that.  </p>

		 <p>For more information on how Article 13 poses a threat to the ability to build software online, please visit <a href="https://savecodeshare.eu/">Save Code Share</a> and read our <a href="https://savecodeshare.eu/static/assets/WhitePaper-ImpactofArticel13onSoftwareEcosystem-SaveCodeShare.pdf">White Paper</a>. </p>

		<h2 id="whatelsehavewedone">What else have we done? Inside and Outside the FSFE</h2>

			<ul>
			
			<li>Success of our <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money? Public Code!</a> campaign so far has been overwhelming. In the time of writing, we are more then 12.500 individual subscribers of the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/openletter/">open letter</a> and the campaign is backed by the support of more than 80 organisations. The campaign gained attention by a huge <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/Activities/PMPC/Press">press coverage</a> and also many prominent people, developers, artists, CEOs and politicians have joined our demand that whenever software is financed by public money it should be public code as well. If you have not done so already, join us now and sign the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/#action">open letter</a>. </li>
