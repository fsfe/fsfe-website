    <h1>Who is doing all the work</h1>

<p>FSFE's General Assembly decides on our strategy and oversees our
work. We welcomed two new members this year, bringing the total
to 17. Martin Gollowitzer is a long-term volunteer from Austria who
has consistently worked on the Fellowship. Nikos Roussos from Greece
was elected to serve a two-year term as a Fellowship representative
alongside Hugo Roy from France.</p>
<p>After Erik joined the team in October to support volunteers' activities throughout Europe, 
FSFE now has seven people on staff. Four of these work full
time, three part time. In addition, we had a number of great interns
this year, who made important contributions to our work. Some of them
have taken on responsibility coordinating volunteers, such as
Alessandro Polvani with the Italian team and Eszter Bako with our
policy team. We have fresh interns lined up for 2013, and are already
looking forward to hosting them.</p>
<p>We couldn't have achieved the impact we made in 2012 without our
Fellows and volunteers. Many people contributed, each person with
their own special skills, for example as developers, system
administrators, lawyers. The translators team helps us to spread the
word about Free Software across Europe and the world, by translating
our website into up to 30 languages. </p>
