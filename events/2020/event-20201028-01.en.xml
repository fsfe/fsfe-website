    <title>OSSEU2020: Public Money? Public Code! â€“ What Role does Free Software Play after the Corona Crisis? online, Ireland</title>

    <body>
      <p>In a time when humanity needs to work together to find solutions for a crisis, we cannot afford to reinvent the wheel again and again for software that helps us tackle the spread of COVID-19. Global problems need global solutions! It is Free Software that enables global cooperation for code development. During the crisis we have seen a lot of Free Software and projects trying to tackle the crisis like tracing apps, hackathons or solutions for remote working - but what will happen after the crisis?</p>
      <p>Already before this crisis hundreds of organizations and tens of thousands of people demanded that publicly financed software developed for the public sector must be made publicly available under Free Software licenses.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, 28.10.2020, at 17:15 our Policy Manager Alexander Sander will talk about the advantages of using Free Software in the public sector, about the learnings from the corona crisis and why it is now even more important to use Free Software than ever before.</p>
