<h1>Let’s make Device Neutrality a reality in Europe!
</h1>

<p> As the Digital Markets Act comes into effect today, Device 
Neutrality starts to become  a tangible reality in the European Union. 
While acknowledging the new law, the FSFE alerts that this is only the first 
step and further commitment is necessary.</p>

<p>Digital devices are becoming increasingly important tools in our 
daily tasks, with more and more of us using them in different areas of 
our lives. However, we, as end-users, are losing control over them – 
especially the ability to run Free Software – due to unfair practices by 
device manufacturers, vendors, and platforms.</p> 

<p><a href="https://deviceneutrality.org/">Device Neutrality</a> aims to 
restore end-user control over devices by 
ensuring software freedom in devices, protecting users from lock-ins and 
promoting their control over data in devices. It seeks to enable 
end-users to run the software of their choice and use services 
independently of the control exercised by hardware manufacturers, 
vendors, and platforms, known as gatekeepers.</p> 

<p>Some aspects of Device Neutrality are imposed on large tech 
companies by the <a 
href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022R1925">Digital 
Markets Act (DMA)</a>, a recent EU law that 
enters into force on 7 March, to reestablish higher degrees of 
competition in digital markets. Therefore, <a 
href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_4328">the 
DMA will be applicable 
to six gatekeepers</a>: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Bytedance, Meta, and 
Microsoft.</p>

<p>
The FSFE has been involved with the DMA throughout the legislative process, 
and welcomes its entry into force, which makes several elements of 
Device Neutrality legally enforceable. However, while the DMA represents 
a very important step in holding gatekeepers accountable for their 
negative disruptions and distortions in digital markets, the law alone 
is not enough to promote Device Neutrality to the extent necessary to 
re-empower end-user control over devices.
</p>

<h2>The Digital Markets Act: only a first step towards Device 
Neutrality</h2> 

<p>Initially, the enforcement of the DMA will be 
challenging, as the law addresses diverse aspects of devices including 
the (un)installation of software,  the use of third-party apps stores 
and payment systems, interoperability obligations for operating systems 
and messaging apps, and some degree of real-time data portability. 
Imposing legal obligations on such elements will require considerable 
enforcement efforts and proper monitoring of the technical solutions 
implemented by the gatekeepers.</p> 

<p>Besides, similarly to <a href="/activities/routers/routers.html">Router 
Freedom</a> where network operators create 
various barriers and hurdles for end-users to exercise that right, 
gatekeepers may try hard to avoid implementing solutions that will 
fully benefit end-users, but rather may use the law in ways that can hinder 
end-users’ rights related to Device Neutrality. For instance, the tech 
company Apple – one of the gatekeepers – has already gone to court to 
avoid the DMA obligations, and decided to implement <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/device-neutrality/fsfe-apple-report-final.pdf">an 
absurd strategy against third-party apps 
stores (PDF)</a> that will negatively impact the ability of 
alternatives such as F-Droid to enter iOS environments.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the FSFE will collaborate with the 
European Commission and other regulators to monitor compliance with the 
DMA, so that the DMA will act as a catalyst for Device Neutrality rather than an 
additional barrier to it.</p> 

<blockquote><p>“DMA represents a bold step from the EU to regulate large 
companies acting as gatekeepers over devices. However, proper 
implementation of the law will be challenging, and it will require 
strict monitoring from civil society to safeguard Device Neutrality. 
Open Internet needs Device Neutrality. Free Software is key to achieve 
that”.</p>
<p> -Lucas Lasota, FSFE’s Legal Programme Manager -</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Going beyond very large platforms</h2>

<p>The DMA is limited to big tech companies. The law only applies to 
enterprises providing services to at least 45 million monthly active 
end-users established or located in the EU on a yearly basis. Taking into 
account other quantitative restrictions, Device Neutrality is safeguarded 
by the law against only a handful of gatekeepers. 
Smaller companies may also engage in predatory behavior against 
Device Neutrality, negatively impacting end-users' rights. However, they 
are not covered by the DMA.</p> 

<p>That’s why the FSFE is promoting Device Neutrality in a much broader 
context to include not only large companies but any device 
manufacturer, vendor, or platform. We strongly believe that software 
freedom should be the default standard and end-users should not be 
imprisoned into lock-ins. Tech companies should not trap users into 
walled gardens that limit what they can do with their devices.</p>

<p>In parallel to its involvement with the DMA, the FSFE is launching <a 
href="https://deviceneutrality.org/">a 
new website for Device Neutrality</a> to raise public awareness of topics 
concerning Device Neutrality. This site points to in-depth insights 
about Device Neutrality and Free Software, downloadable promotional 
material, and ways to  spread the word. Check it out!</p>

<h2>Supporting the work on Device Neutrality</h2>

<p>Higher degrees of openness and equality in digital markets can only 
be achieved when end-users can enjoy software freedom with their 
devices. The DMA is the first step, and the FSFE will continue to work 
for Device Neutrality in different areas: monitoring DMA 
implementation, overseeing compliance, collaborating with regulators 
and policy makers, promoting public awareness, and expanding the 
agenda beyond gatekeepers. For that, we count on your support for our 
work with a donation. Get active and help us empower you to regain 
control over your devices!</p>
