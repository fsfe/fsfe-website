<h1>Legal Structure</h1>
</center>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is an <a
href="/about/self-conception.html">international, team-based
organisation</a>. Legally, it is set up as a modular structure that
allows us to expand it step by step into every country that feels part
of Europe, whether it is part of the European Union or not.</p>

<h2>The Hub</h2>

<p>The Hub is the central legal body, the core of the FSF Europe. All
<a href="/about/members.html">members</a> of the FSF Europe have to be
members of the Hub by constitution.</p>

<p>The Hub is the legal body necessary to implement the activities
of the <a href="/about/team.html">team</a>.</p>

<p>The Hub is by happenstance a charitable association ("e.V.")
registered in Germany with the following constitution:</p>
<ul>
<li>English: <a href="/about/legal/Constitution.en.pdf">PDF (56k)</a> <a href="/about/legal/constitution.en.html">HTML</a></li>
<li>German: <a href="/about/legal/Constitution.de.pdf">PDF (68k)</a> <a href="/about/legal/constitution.de.html">HTML</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Chapters</h3>

<p>Chapters are local legal bodies of the FSF Europe, formed by the
members of the FSF Europe from that country and sometimes guest
members from other countries. Their main function is to receive
deductable donations, where possible.</p>

<p>Chapters are integrated throughout the FSFE with their statutes,
giving the national teams of FSFE the freedom and autonomy to address
the local issues in the way appropriate for the cultural and social
identity in those countries.</p>

<p>The constitution for these chapters is usually found by modifying
a "template constitution" in order to fit in with the legal system of
that country, aiming for charitable status whenever possible.</p>

<p>That template constitution is also available:</p>
<ul>
<li>English: <a href="/about/legal/Constitution-CTmpl.en.pdf">PDF (64k)</a><a href="/about/legal/template-constitution.en.html">HTML</a></li>
<li>German: <a href="/about/legal/Constitution-CTmpl.de.pdf">PDF (66k)</a><a href="/about/legal/template-constitution.de.html">HTML</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Fully-established Chapters currently exist in</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/about/legal/de/de.html">Germany</a> (<a href="de/constitution.html">Constitution</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries currently represented with members in the FSF Europe:
