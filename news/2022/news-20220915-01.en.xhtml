<h1>FSFE is hiring a working student as an assistant system administrator</h1>

<p>
  We are looking for a working student to support our work in 
  empowering people to control technology. The person will support the 
  FSFE's technical infrastructure by working with our system 
  administrators. The work is 10 hours per week in the Berlin office 
  and home office is possible at a later stage.
</p>

<h2>About the FSFE</h2>

<p>
  Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to
  control technology. Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our 
  lives and it is important that technology empowers rather than 
  restricts us. <a href="/freesoftware/">Free 
  Software</a> gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt, 
  and share software. These rights help support other fundamental 
  freedoms like freedom of speech, press, and privacy.
</p>

<p>
  The FSFE helps individuals and organisations to understand how Free
  Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and
  self-determination. We enhance users' rights by abolishing barriers
  to Free Software adoption, encourage people to use and develop Free
  Software, and provide resources to enable everyone to further
  promote Free Software in Europe.
</p>

<p>
  We are involved in <a href="/activities/">many activities</a> in the
  legal, economic, political and technical areas around Free Software.
  Our work is made possible by a community of volunteers, supporters,
  donors, and staff. The assistant system administrator's job will
  strengthen the technical backbone of our operations.

  strengths are. You will learn to organise your workflow and prioritise 
  your tasks.

  decision. The closing date for applications is <em>Sunday 16 October
  2022</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Free Software is meant to serve everyone regardless of their age,
  ability or disability, gender identity, sex, race, religion or
  sexual orientation. Hence, we encourage applications from all
  backgrounds and promise to judge all applications on merit, without
  reference to any of the characteristics listed. To promote diversity
  and equality in the Free Software community, we shall give preference
  to applicants who identify as part of a traditionally marginalised
  demographic in technology for applications of equal strength.
