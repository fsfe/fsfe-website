		<p newsteaser="yes">This month, we focus our attention on digital restrictions and the international Day against it. To this end, we launched our first episode of the monthly Software Freedom Podcast, this time starring Cory Doctorow talking about DRM. We have published our yearly report, summing up our activities of the past 12 months and shining light on the community we build our success on. As usual, you will also discover upcoming events with the FSFE, including our Annual Community meeting, as well as recordings and information from events we participated.</p>

		<p>On October 12, on the <a href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/">international Day Against DRM</a>, we launched <a href="/news/podcast/episode-1.en.html">our first Episode of the FSFE&#39;s new Software Freedom Podcast</a> starring Cory Doctorow - author and activist in favour of liberalising copyright laws and extended usage of Creative Commons licenses. Doctorow&#39;s long time advocacy makes him an interesting person to address different issues included in Digital Restrictions Management (DRM). We discuss the differences between books and e-books with DRM and see how DRM changes our entire experience of reading and how that reverberates into our relationship with books and readings. Further, we dive into the economic and security aspects related to DRM and regulations of the so called &quot;Internet of Things&quot;.  Listen or download our <a href="/news/podcast/episode-1.en.html">first podcast</a> absolutely DRM-free and explore with us some burning issues on digital restrictions and freedoms. Also be aware that starting with this episode, we broadcast a <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/podcast.html">monthly Software Freedom Podcast series</a> in which we invite diverse people with inspirational ideas related to software freedom.</p>
		
		<p>In addition, we used the international Day Against DRM again to <a href="/news/2019/news-20191012-01.html">explain the dangers of DRM in relation to Free Software</a>: While Free Software is software that puts the user in control of their own  devices, DRM in contrast is  technology to put the user under control of a third party. These two  goals are fundamentally incompatible and opposing the FSFE&#39;s mission to empower people to control technology. </p>

		<p><a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2019/news-20191022-01.html">&quot;Software Freedom in Europe&quot;</a> is our yearly report that gives you a breakdown of the important things the FSFE has done and achieved during the last 12 months. You will read about our ongoing work for router freedom in Europe, about the first Parliament in Europe who joined our &quot;Public Money? Public Code!&quot; campaign, about our new version of REUSE tools to help Free Software developers with easy license compliance and about much more of our multi-faceted policy work - all together aiming at a world in which users are in control of technology!</p>
	
		<p>Besides our policy work and projects, we also shine light on our community and its members; because it is only though working together with our community that the FSFE is able to form a movement across Europe to build a society based on users&#39; and software freedom. To this end we also report about the events that we organised and participated in, from policy meetings to our web-a-thons.</p>

			<p>As with every month, we are trying to spread the word and help individuals and organisations understand what Free Software is and how Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination. If you are interested in seeing us in action and to join our cause, keep in mind the following dates and locations in the coming weeks:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Between November 15 and 16 the FSFE Community Meeting will unite forces with the <a href="https://www.sfscon.it/">South Tyrol Free Software Conference (SFScon)</a> in Bolzano, Italy. The FSFE will have its own track and you are kindly invited to join the expert and community talks, as well as the social activities.

			<p>Since the last newsletter we have been active in promoting the Free Software cause, by helping individuals and organisations have a better understanding of what Free Software is and encouraging them to develop and implement it in their lives. We want to share with you the events we have photos, videos or other recordings below:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>*On October 3, the FSFE Rhein-Main Local Group participated at the MouseOpener Day <a href="https://www.wdrmaus.de/tuer_oeffner_tag/2019/">&quot;Maustüröffner-Tag&quot;</a> happening all over Germany. At this annual event, local organizations and companies open their doors to give kids insights into a broad amount of topics. In Frankfurt, the <a href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/RheinMain">FSFE local group Rhein-Main</a> supported the local Linux user group with organizing the event and giving kids the opportunity to explore computers using Free Software. About 20 young &quot;hackers&quot; joined the event and got to know LibreOffice, LeoCAD and Scratch. To not foget the parents, there was an info corner explaining them Free Software.</li>

			<li>On October 6, the FSFE Local Group in Vienna, hosted an information booth at the annual Animal Welfare Run.

			<li>Our initative “Public Money? Public Code!” attracted the attention of the City Council of Kassel, Germany. They discussed it as the guiding principle for any new software purchases. The initial <a href="https://wwwsvc1.stadt-kassel.de/sdnet4/sdnetrim/UGhVM0hpd2NXNFdFcExjZdVAqtDsyk6NI6JGuDt3FofJuLfmVwORJMBbm95QJXFk/Antrag_FDP-FW-Piraten_101.18.1330.pdf">proposal</a> was discussed on October 23rd by the Municipality&#39;s Financial Committee, and final decisions on implementation are expected to be made on November 4th.  To help implementing “Public Money? Public Code!” in the city of Kassel , we kindly ask you to send an e-mail to the members of the local Parliament and ask them to support this proposal. The contact details can be found on <a href="https://wwwsvc1.stadt-kassel.de/sdnet4/fraktionen">Kassel&#39;s municipality page</a> under &quot;City Council fractions&quot; section. If a member does not have a clear contact details, you can call the Parliament and ask for it.</li>
