  <p>
    Max Mehl is Programme Manager at the FSFE and coordinates
    initiatives in the areas of legal and licensing, political
    advocacy, information security, and public awareness. But he is
    also frequently to be found in the virtual server rooms of the
    FSFE. He sees Free Software as an important component to solve
    urgent technical and social problems. Every day he is fascinated
    how many advantages software freedom brings for different aspects -
    from ethics to politics and economy to security technology.

    He started to get active in FSFE in 2011 as a voluntary translator. 
    Later he did a six month internship. Since then he has been 
    involved in numerous campaigns, public events, and policy issues as 
    a volunteer and later as part-time employee.
