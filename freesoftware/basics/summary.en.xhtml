    <div id="introduction">
    
	<p>Free Software is software that guarantees a set of
	freedoms to its users. It is 'free' as in freedom not as in 'free of charge'.
	Although some people refer to it, such as Libre Software, Open Source,
	FOSS, and FLOSS, at FSFE, <a
	href="/documents/whyfs.en.html">we prefer to talk
	about Free Software</a> because this better reflects the
	philosophy of the <a
	href="/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html">four
	freedoms</a> which are intrinsic to it.
	</p>
      
    </div>
    
    <p>The Free Software movement was started by Richard Stallman in 1983
    when he inaugurated the <a
      href="/freesoftware/basics/gnuproject.en.html">GNU
      project</a>. This was based on the idea that people should 
    have full control over the software they they use. Stallman recognised that in order to achieve this, access to the computer program's <a
      href="/freesoftware/basics/sourcecode.en.html">source
      code</a> was a fundamental requirement. Beyond the realm of just the computer industry, the struggle for
    Free Software has extended to the adoption of laws on <a
      href="/freesoftware/basics/openstandard.en.html">open
      standards</a>.</p>
