Welcome to the second episode of the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:17.720 --> 00:21.240
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.160
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:24.160 --> 00:28.360
I am Matthias Kirschner, I am the President of the Free Software Foundation Europe and

00:28.360 --> 00:32.240
also from our side today with me is Bonnie Merring, our current intern.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.240
Hello, our guest for today is Lydia Fincher.

00:35.240 --> 00:41.200
She is the Vice President of KDE and she has been with KDE since 2006 and on the board

00:41.200 --> 00:43.520
of KDE we since 2011.

00:43.520 --> 00:50.160
Well, while we were preparing the podcast I looked up what KDE is actually doing and it's

00:50.160 --> 00:52.280
developing a lot of free software.

00:52.280 --> 00:57.560
It's an international community and it maintains a lot of free software projects.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.240
The FSV has very close relationships with KDE for a long time.

01:01.240 --> 01:06.040
We work together on several topics and exchange knowledge about for example running a German

01:06.040 --> 01:11.560
EV although you have European or international activities and also for example how to manage

01:11.560 --> 01:13.880
copyright in such a huge project.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.200
So welcome.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.280
Thank you for being with us Lydia.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.120
Thank you so much for inviting me.

01:19.120 --> 01:24.160
Could you briefly introduce KDE to us and what are you doing there?

01:24.160 --> 01:25.560
How is it working?

01:26.080 --> 01:27.400
Sure.

01:27.400 --> 01:33.920
So KDE is a free software community that started out working on a desktop.

01:33.920 --> 01:42.520
In 1996 Matthias Etrich started out this project with the aim to build a user-friendly desktop

01:42.520 --> 01:49.600
that his partner could use for day-to-day work like writing some texts, listening to some

01:49.600 --> 01:52.000
music and similar things.

01:52.040 --> 02:00.360
Since then a lot has happened among them that we have a very good desktop that anyone

02:00.360 --> 02:06.720
can use for day-to-day work but also a ton of applications around it that anyone can

02:06.720 --> 02:11.280
use to do their day-to-day work on a computer.

02:11.280 --> 02:16.960
We have music players, we have a natural painting program, we have educational software,

02:16.960 --> 02:20.320
we have a web browser and so much more.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.520
How did you yourself get involved in KDE?

02:23.520 --> 02:29.920
So I got involved when I studied computer science and while I studied computer science I was

02:29.920 --> 02:36.880
using Windows and at some point I noticed like this isn't right, there has to be something

02:36.880 --> 02:43.520
better, there has to be something more where I have much more power over the software

02:43.520 --> 02:46.520
I am using than I had before.

02:46.520 --> 02:51.800
So I was looking around and talking to other people, I was studying with and clearly

02:51.800 --> 02:59.440
at that time Ubuntu was the hot new thing so I tried out Ubuntu but I didn't quite warm

02:59.440 --> 03:05.880
up to it, it wasn't quite right for me and I dug around a bit more and stumbled up on

03:05.880 --> 03:12.880
Kubuntu which had KDE software on it and I was blown away because it had exactly everything

03:12.880 --> 03:18.000
I needed and specifically all of its programs beautifully worked together.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.120
So it had a my own program that had an address book and that address book was connected

03:23.120 --> 03:28.400
to my IRC client, to my instant messaging client and everything really beautifully worked

03:28.400 --> 03:31.880
together and I have not looked back since.

03:31.880 --> 03:36.840
But as far as I understand KDE is not your daily job, you work there as a volunteer,

03:36.840 --> 03:41.880
how do you manage to do both, like a daily job and working as a volunteer?

03:42.880 --> 03:48.240
So my day job is working as the product manager for Wikidata which is a system project

03:48.240 --> 03:54.160
of Wikipedia to build a knowledge base with general purpose data about the world and that

03:54.160 --> 04:01.640
is really cool because it allows me quite some flexibility to manage my own schedule

04:01.640 --> 04:09.200
in a way that allows for a lot of the things that KDE requires from me and then there's

04:09.200 --> 04:16.880
a lot of good time management and I kind of learned to do this that are meticulously used.

04:16.880 --> 04:25.240
So on the question of like volunteering in such a large project, I once said a conversation

04:25.240 --> 04:31.840
with someone from a company and that was very interesting because it's always this

04:31.840 --> 04:36.240
strange decision for me if I should hire more people out of the KDE community because

04:36.240 --> 04:41.920
I mean they know the technology I need in my company but if I hire them, then usually

04:41.920 --> 04:47.800
because they work during all the day with this technology already, they are not so motivated

04:47.800 --> 04:51.520
to continue with working with those technologies in their free time.

04:51.520 --> 04:58.520
So when I hire more people from the KDE community, I will see less activity in the KDE community.

04:58.520 --> 05:05.640
So is it a problem for KDE if those technology which you also use like CUED, if they are

05:05.640 --> 05:07.720
commercially very successful?

05:07.720 --> 05:13.160
I don't see it as a zero sum game where quite the opposite.

05:13.160 --> 05:18.160
In the past it has been a problem for us but in recent years we've really turned things

05:18.160 --> 05:25.520
around there in that there are more companies who employ people not just because they know

05:25.520 --> 05:28.600
KDE but also to work on KDE itself.

05:28.600 --> 05:34.160
So more of that time is freed up to actually work on KDE as if they were just doing it

05:34.160 --> 05:40.240
in their free time but I think the even more important part of that is that people are

05:40.240 --> 05:46.240
empowered to make a living on free software and the more this becomes an option, the

05:46.240 --> 05:48.720
better it is for all of free software.

05:48.720 --> 05:54.640
Okay, if there are so many volunteers now professionally earning their money with free software,

05:54.640 --> 06:00.280
how many of these volunteers do you have and how many of them are working like earning

06:00.280 --> 06:02.840
their money with free software?

06:02.840 --> 06:08.760
So I mean there's thousands of people contributing to KDE every month, it's very hard to have

06:08.760 --> 06:14.120
numbers on that of course because it's a huge project where people contribute in very

06:14.120 --> 06:15.160
different ways.

06:15.160 --> 06:22.720
So some rate code, some do more project management type of tasks, others help on a report

06:22.720 --> 06:27.160
to test something, the next person writes some documentation and so on so it's very hard

06:27.160 --> 06:32.800
to really have a number on that but in the thousands.

06:32.800 --> 06:38.600
Of those, how many make a living on with free software, again hard to tell because we

06:38.600 --> 06:43.960
don't ask people usually these types of questions but especially in the KDE core community

06:43.960 --> 06:45.720
I would say it's quite a few.

06:45.720 --> 06:48.120
And do you have to feeling that it increased over time?

06:48.120 --> 06:54.480
Yes, it definitely increased over time and in part because we spend a lot of time building

06:54.480 --> 06:59.600
out relationships to the companies around us and empowering people to start companies around

06:59.600 --> 07:05.360
KDE to provide customizations on top of KDE to provide additional software development

07:05.360 --> 07:07.840
and similar things.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.200
Is it still increasing?

07:10.200 --> 07:17.640
I would say it's still increasing in general, we've had a bump in contributions a few

07:17.640 --> 07:24.920
years ago and that came from people kind of losing their way, KDE started out as trying

07:24.920 --> 07:28.120
to build an end user desktop.

07:28.120 --> 07:33.880
And at some point we had achieved that but also not and the world around us was moving

07:33.880 --> 07:41.960
on right and individual people in KDE didn't concentrate so much on KDE as a whole anymore

07:41.960 --> 07:48.200
but on their individual application for example and we were lacking cohesion across all of

07:48.200 --> 07:57.360
KDE to really figure out what are we as KDE doing, why are we even here together and when

07:57.360 --> 08:01.880
we realized that we said okay we need to change this because this is not good for community

08:01.880 --> 08:07.960
and we started a process to define what we want to work on together.

08:07.960 --> 08:14.960
And out of that came three goals that we worked on over the past few years and now we elected

08:14.960 --> 08:21.920
new goals at the last academy or annual conference and that has really helped get new people

08:22.000 --> 08:28.640
who are interested in these goals that we set but also re-energized the people that we had

08:28.640 --> 08:35.040
and who are kind of disillusioned to kind of give them a new focus and yes they're still really

08:35.040 --> 08:38.720
exciting stuff that you can do here and it's really important that we do it.

08:38.720 --> 08:43.920
Okay, let me come back to the girls in a second, first person I want to ask you about the shift

08:43.920 --> 08:51.280
of generation you already mentioned so how do you deal with a shift like that because you have

08:51.280 --> 08:57.440
all the old school programmers back there and now you have these young GitHub generation.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.880
Hmm, how do you deal with that in such a huge project?

09:00.880 --> 09:07.920
I think KDE is one of the big projects that manage to become multi-generational and in part

09:08.480 --> 09:15.520
this has been because we've always put a huge focus on mentoring and raising

09:15.600 --> 09:21.280
so to say the next generation we take part in programs like Google Summer of Code but also have

09:21.280 --> 09:26.960
our own mentoring program and there's a lot of informal mentoring going on that really brings

09:26.960 --> 09:33.440
along the next generation and teaches them how we work and why we do certain things but also

09:33.440 --> 09:40.160
empowers them to question a few things and do things differently and what are your goals for the

09:40.160 --> 09:48.880
next two years? So the ones we have elected are consistency all about the apps and Wayland.

09:49.520 --> 09:58.160
Now I need to explain a bit more about what that means. So let's start with Wayland. KDE's software

09:58.160 --> 10:03.520
for quite some time has been trying to get to the point where it works very well on Wayland,

10:03.520 --> 10:09.680
the new window-managing protocol. So for our listeners before it was the XWindow

10:09.680 --> 10:16.000
system and now there is this huge shift with lots of distributions to switch to Wayland.

10:16.000 --> 10:23.680
Yes, which brings a lot of benefits with it among the more security and so on but it is a huge

10:23.680 --> 10:29.040
amount of work that needs to be done to adapt both Plasma, our desktop but also all our applications

10:29.040 --> 10:36.560
to iron out little bucks and make them work with support for example for things like tablets

10:36.560 --> 10:42.640
so our natural painting application Cretac can work nicely and you can paint beautiful pictures.

10:43.520 --> 10:50.400
This transition takes a lot of work and just needs more focus so that we can make this transition happen.

10:50.400 --> 10:57.840
That is what Wayland as a goal is about. Then we have all about the apps which is focusing on

10:57.840 --> 11:06.000
the idea that KDE over the last years has been focusing very much on promoting our desktop and has

11:06.000 --> 11:13.840
been collecting the promotion of our applications a bit and we want to change that by bringing them

11:13.840 --> 11:21.280
into app stores and so on so that people can easily get to them and enjoy our applications no

11:21.280 --> 11:27.200
matter which operating system they use or how they get their applications and the third one

11:27.200 --> 11:34.320
consistency as in any big project that has been growing for a very long time there's a lot of

11:34.960 --> 11:40.000
inconsistencies that creep in different applications implementing the same thing in slightly

11:40.000 --> 11:46.240
different ways or just things that don't make sense if you take a step back and the consistency

11:46.240 --> 11:53.360
goal is trying to identify those and make things more consistent so that you can enjoy using our

11:53.360 --> 11:59.840
applications. So when you talk about that before you concentrated a lot on a desktop I would switch

11:59.840 --> 12:06.480
the focus a little bit to the mobile area and I mean there were recent developments with

12:06.480 --> 12:14.240
Huawei and a lot of people saw that they were not able or had problems with continuing to ship

12:14.240 --> 12:21.120
their phones with Android because of restriction by the US government so more and more people think

12:21.120 --> 12:27.360
about the centralization of operating systems on the mobile devices and the services which are

12:27.360 --> 12:37.280
provided there so I wonder how do you see the role of KDE and KDE plasma in relationship to the

12:37.280 --> 12:46.480
Android and mobile phone area. So on the one hand the mobile phone applications that we have

12:46.480 --> 12:52.320
and every provide for example some educational programs we do want them to work on Android right

12:52.320 --> 12:57.120
because a huge amount of people out there are using Android phones and they should be able to

12:57.120 --> 13:05.200
use our software because the first step getting away from a closed platform is using some open

13:05.760 --> 13:13.600
programs and applications on it so the switch later to a completely free system isn't as big

13:13.600 --> 13:19.280
and as frightening. So we do want people to use our applications on Android and we make them

13:19.280 --> 13:25.840
available. Where do you make them available on an f-troid then or on the play store and on f-troid

13:25.840 --> 13:33.600
yeah so that's the integrating and the existing system piece and the other side is plasma mobile

13:33.600 --> 13:40.160
as a system that nicely integrates with our desktop. People will continue to use desktops and

13:40.160 --> 13:47.520
laptops for a lot of work they do right writing your master's thesis on a mobile phone or tablet

13:47.520 --> 13:55.920
is going to be very very painful for example doing all that research and so on. So what we are

13:55.920 --> 14:02.720
trying to enable is you do your work on your laptop or your desktop and seamlessly it integrates

14:02.720 --> 14:09.040
with your phone so that you can continue working there whatever you were doing watching a movie or

14:09.600 --> 14:17.920
and so on and plasma mobile is part of that story but it is of course also part of

14:17.920 --> 14:26.880
the story of a completely open mobile stack and that is not something KDE can do on its own it needs

14:26.880 --> 14:33.680
a lot of support from different players around us because we have a certain area of expertise

14:33.760 --> 14:42.720
that is desktop and apps for end users and we need to work together with other people for example

14:42.720 --> 14:50.320
on opening up hardware and benefiting from that because no one can do that alone. So if we stay

14:50.320 --> 14:55.200
with that topic which KDE plasma if if Huawei says well we would like to use that on our mobile

14:55.200 --> 15:00.160
phones would it be ready for that or what would be needed there? I think there would be still

15:00.160 --> 15:06.880
be quite a lot of work to be done simply because the number of people working on plasma mobile is

15:06.880 --> 15:13.520
so much smaller than the number of people working on for example Android but that doesn't mean

15:13.520 --> 15:19.760
it wouldn't be possible and I think with Qt and the existing KDE applications we actually have a

15:19.760 --> 15:26.480
very good ground to work from and a head start so to say seems to be a good alternative

15:26.480 --> 15:32.480
then for Android in a few years? Hopefully and I would love it if more people join us in making

15:32.480 --> 15:40.160
that happen. You hear this guys? Okay I have a different topic yes and I want to ask here about

15:40.160 --> 15:47.760
sustainability because I am really into this topic. I was wondering it's such a huge topic in

15:47.760 --> 15:54.240
the conversation okay after society. How is KDE dealing with this is this any topic in the

15:54.240 --> 16:02.240
community? Like especially digital sustainability? Right so it is definitely a topic and as you

16:02.240 --> 16:08.880
can imagine in a community as large and diverse as KDE that is not an easy discussion because

16:08.880 --> 16:15.600
there are so many different opinions and so many different details that people care about

16:15.600 --> 16:22.720
because people care so we've been having discussions like should we take part in the global

16:22.720 --> 16:31.280
climate strike and similar things? And it started kind of from the question around okay what

16:31.280 --> 16:38.080
can KDEV the support organization do and what should it do when for example it is sending people

16:38.080 --> 16:45.360
to sprints from far places or when it's organizing the annual conference academy? How can we make

16:45.360 --> 16:52.160
that more sustainable? There's still a lot to be discussed but it's making progress and I think we

16:52.880 --> 16:58.560
end up with a policy and that gives us some guidance on that on what the KDE community

16:58.560 --> 17:04.960
thinks and I hope we have that in the next year. So then I would go into one other topic I mentioned

17:04.960 --> 17:10.160
in the introduction already that KDE is the biggest organization, volunteer organization out there

17:10.160 --> 17:19.120
which is using the FSFE's fiduciary license agreement so that agreement was created to concentrate

17:19.120 --> 17:27.680
decision power within one entity in this case KDEV to prevent the fragmentation of rights on one

17:27.680 --> 17:33.920
hand while on the other side preventing single entity like KDEV then from abusing its power to

17:33.920 --> 17:40.880
just realize all the code into like a proprietary software license. So what is your experience with that?

17:41.360 --> 17:51.760
The FRA is very important for us I don't believe we put enough thought into it how important it is

17:51.760 --> 17:57.760
unfortunately as a community because there are very few cases you become aware of when it really

17:57.760 --> 18:03.600
matters until it's too late. One example very recently someone was trying to realize

18:03.760 --> 18:10.800
a part of one of our applications code so they could reuse it in other places and they were just

18:10.800 --> 18:17.040
liking the okay from one individual contributor. Now that was the main contributor to that code.

18:18.080 --> 18:24.400
It turns out after a lot of research and trying to contact that person that they have been

18:25.200 --> 18:31.840
in an accident a long time ago and have stopped contributing to KDE because of what happened in

18:31.840 --> 18:37.680
that accident and now in this particular case we got lucky and we got the okay to realize

18:37.680 --> 18:44.320
on that code but what would have happened right you never know and unfortunately you

18:45.760 --> 18:52.160
realize how much you need that when it's too late and I think we should be paying a lot more

18:52.160 --> 18:58.400
attention to that and getting a lot more people to sign the FRA but that takes work.

18:58.480 --> 19:04.880
That was a hard topic you weren't thinking about accidents and what else could happen but

19:04.880 --> 19:10.080
yeah as you said it's important to think about the other things because we don't want to be in a

19:10.080 --> 19:14.480
situation that a lot of code has to be rewritten because we haven't thought about it beforehand.

19:15.840 --> 19:23.280
Especially in communities where there's usually central figures who contribute a lot of the

19:23.280 --> 19:32.560
code. So also one of the more long-term topics I mean we talked before about KDE's focus on the

19:32.560 --> 19:41.360
desktop now shifting the focus on apps and also on the mobile sphere. Now looking further some years

19:42.080 --> 19:47.120
we might not even have a mobile phone anymore but there are lots of lots of devices around us

19:47.840 --> 19:53.920
which are all connected and you might interact with your computer in different ways than we are used

19:54.480 --> 20:01.120
so how do you see KDE's role if that would happen or if that happens. That is part of what we prepared

20:01.120 --> 20:08.000
for all right we started out so focused on the desktop and we realized that that is becoming

20:08.000 --> 20:15.040
less and less relevant while still being important but it can't be the only thing that keeps us

20:15.040 --> 20:22.080
alive as a community. We are there because we want to give people freedom and empowerment over

20:22.080 --> 20:27.520
their digital lives wherever their digital life is whatever that means that is where we have to be

20:28.160 --> 20:35.360
and if it means all kinds of internet of things devices in the next years then we will have to

20:35.360 --> 20:42.320
look at that as well. Are you looking at it already or do you until now ignore the internet of

20:42.320 --> 20:50.240
things. It's definitely not our focus at the moment. Now when we are looking for next year on

20:50.240 --> 20:57.440
the 14th of February the FSFE always celebrates the I love free software day or we remind people about

20:57.440 --> 21:02.880
the I love free software day because we want thought that in the free software community we are

21:02.880 --> 21:09.360
sometimes a bit harsh with each other. I mean you might have experience with that in the KDE

21:09.360 --> 21:15.680
community as well that there are people who criticize each other they make bug reports and tell

21:15.680 --> 21:22.560
others of their software doesn't work and tell them what to do better and in all of that the

21:22.560 --> 21:28.720
discussion can sometimes get a bit heated and we thought it's good to run people once a year at

21:28.720 --> 21:35.680
least to say thank you so we will have that again on the 14th of February. Now my question would be

21:35.760 --> 21:41.440
when you now already have to decide about who would you thank there and I make it a bit easier

21:41.440 --> 21:45.600
for you because I don't want to bring in the position that afterwards people in your community will

21:45.600 --> 21:53.520
say well she thanked this project of KDE and not the other one so which project outside of KDE would

21:53.520 --> 21:59.680
you thank there. Very good question. I think the I love free software day is a great opportunity

21:59.760 --> 22:08.080
because we thank each other way too little. KDE is a very great community and we are very friendly

22:08.080 --> 22:13.520
and and they thank you to each other but there can always be more and there can definitely always

22:13.520 --> 22:18.960
be more in free software as a whole. So yes we should do that more often. Now in particular which

22:18.960 --> 22:27.200
free software project would I sense of love that would be signal for allowing me to privately

22:27.280 --> 22:32.240
and securely communicate with all the people I care about. Lydia thank you very much for being

22:32.240 --> 22:37.760
with us. It was a great pleasure to have you here again and yes all the best. Thank you so much

22:37.760 --> 22:44.720
and thank you to you and the FSVE for keeping free software available and amazing for all of us

22:44.720 --> 22:49.840
here. I also say thank you and now I know a lot more about KDE. Thank you bye bye.
