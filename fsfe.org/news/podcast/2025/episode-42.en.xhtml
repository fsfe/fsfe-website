<h1>SFP#42: Policy and EU: The answer for a digital sovereign future must be Free Software</h1>

<p>
Although 42 is the answer for everything we tried to get it into helping us to achieve digital sovereignty in the public infrastructure. However there is an answer out there: digital sovereignty is only possible by empowering people and, therefore public institutions, to control their technology and own infrastructure. 
</p>

<audio-player />

<p>In this final episode of the Policy and EU Software Freedom Podcast for 2025 Alexander Sander and Bonnie Mehring talk about the revision of the EU’s public procurement rules. Together, they dive  into the  processes at the EU level and go through the current debates surrounding public procurement. They highlight the clear need for "Public Money? Public Code!" as an underlying concept in public procurement.
</p>

<p>Find out all about how we can achieve a infrastructure that is controlled by the public institutions. And why Free Software is the only way to achieve this goal.</p>
