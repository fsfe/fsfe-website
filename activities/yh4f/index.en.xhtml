   <h3>Decide yourself what you code</h3>

  <p>
	There is no set challenge or topic for the software you should
	develop. Embrace your imagination and create what is the most
	interesting to you. It can address an everyday problem you have, or
	it can be just fun. It can be a standalone program that you write
	from scratch, or you can modify and combine existing programs. <a
	href="/activities/yh4f/faq.html#what-type-of-software-should-i-make-">The
	possibilities are endless</a>. A vital condition for the competition
	is that the program should be <a
	href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>, so that
	others can use, study, share, and improve the code in the future.
  </p>

 <h3>Take the time you need</h3>

  <p>
	From Monday 1 November 2021 to Thursday 31 March 2022, you will
	have five months to come up with an idea for a Free Software
	program and write it. During the <a
	href="/activities/yh4f/faq.html#2-coding-phase">coding
	period</a> you will be invited to an online group meeting, where
	you and other participants can briefly follow each other’s work,
	exchange ideas, and share problem-solving tips.
  </p>

  <h3>Present your program to top experts</h3>

  <p>
	Your software project will be in good hands, as it will be
	evaluated by Free Software experts. <em><a href="/activities/yh4f/jury.html">Our jury
    members</a></em> excel in
	software development and are deeply involved in the Free Software
	movement. At the same time, they are excellent people to work with.
	After you submit your program, you will have the chance to present
	it to them, as part of your evaluation. This is a nice opportunity
	for you to discuss your idea and your achievement with experienced
	people in the field.
  </p>

  </div>

  <h3>Awesome awards and experiences await</h3>

  <p>
	Based on the jury’s grades, the winners will be determined and
	announced. The first six places will be awarded  <em>cash
	between 4.096€ and 1.024€ each</em>. The <a
	href="/activities/yh4f/faq.html#4-award-ceremony">Award Ceremony</a> of YH4F
	will take place in Brussels in June 2022. All the winners will be
	invited there with covered costs. The Award Ceremony will have top
	speakers in the field of Free Software and it will be a time of
	celebration. You made it! Your hard work paid off. Now you can
	enjoy 2 educative and exciting days in Brussels and socialise with
	fellow winners.

	Forty years ago, Reinhard Wiesemann won a hacking competition for
	young people. He used the money from his cash prize to advance his
	professional development. Now Youth Hacking 4 Freedom is
	financially supported with donations by Reinhard Wiesemann,
