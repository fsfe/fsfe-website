Do you want to join us but your background is not computer science? We are working 
at the political, educational, legal level: our labour is at the point where technology,
society and politics meet. So whether your background is political science, law, 
communications... we welcome your application. </p>

acquiring new knowledge at the same time you feel you are really helping to make 
our world a better place. And they are willing to hear your new ideas and opinion" (Ana Gal√°n, Intern 2012)
