		<title>FSFE Berlin Meeting: Talk about self hosting, FreedomBox, PirateBox in Berlin, Germany</title> 
 
		<body> 
			<p>Is there a cloud, after all? Tobias and Michael present FreedomBox and PirateBox, two somewhat complementary distributions aimed at taking over server tasks typically associated witn "the cloud". As customary for our regular Thursday meetings (every 2nd and 4th Thursday in the month) this will take place at the e-Lok [3], near Bahnhof Ostkreuz. Start will be at about 19:30, although some of us meet earlier to have a meal and chat. Visitors welcome!
