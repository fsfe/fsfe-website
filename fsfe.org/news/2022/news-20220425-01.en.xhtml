  <p>
    Technology experts and ecologists join forces in the Bits &amp; Bäume 
    ('Bits and Trees') conference in October 2022 in Berlin. This year 
    the FSFE is part of its organising committee. We look for exciting 
    talks and insights about how Free Software can help realising a 
    sustainable digital society. Share your expertise and apply until 7 
    June.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) we want to empower 
    users to control technology. This is a necessity for a free society 
    but it is also fundamental for a more just and sustainable society.  
    With Free Software we can keep maintaining programs and prevent 
    software obsolescence. Using Free Software, we can repair and 
    repurpose hardware, extending its lifetime and saving natural 
    resources. It is only with Free Software that we can build long 
    lasting and sustainable IT infrastructures.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Free Software relates to ecological sustainability. Last year, we 
    <a href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html">published a study</a> on the topic and we put theory into action by encouraging 
    users to <a href="https://upcyclingandroid.org">upcycle their Androids</a> with Free Software operating systems. This year we 
    joined the organising committee of the Bits &amp; Bäume 2022, a 
    prominent conference on digitisation and sustainability but also a 
    movement.

    On 30 September <a href="https://bits-und-baeume.org">Bits &amp; 
    Bäume 2022</a> is starting its three-day conference. <a href="https://pretalx.com/bitsundbaeume/cfp">Environmental 
    activists, technical experts and human rights activists are invited 
    to contribute</a>. The FSFE particularly encourages you to give 
    talks about sustainable solutions involving Free Software. 
    <strong>The key questions of this year&#39;s conference 
    are</strong>:
  </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    How should digitisation be shaped in a way that it contributes to a 
    sustainable and democratic transformation of our society?
  </li>
  <li>
    What does a globally, economically, socially and ecologically just 
    future look like in the digitalised world?
  </li>
  <li>
    What can the tech community (bits) and the justice and 
    environmental movement (bäume) learn from each other? And how can 
    those communities get in touch with social-ecological pioneer 
    companies, science and politics?
  </li>
  <li>
    How can we become politically active together?
  </li>
</ol>

  <p>
    If your work or passion includes these themes, this is a perfect 
    opportunity for you to share your knowledge. Possible formats 
    include discussion rounds, lightning talks, project presentations, 
    campaign planning, (hands-on) workshops, activist info tables, 
    installations, film screenings, hackathons, design thinking 
    sessions, interviews, live podcasts, small group work, cultural 
    formats, world cafés, craft workshops, art performances, design 
    elements or anything else creative and innovative you can think of! 
    The talks in the conference are in English or German. <strong>You 
    can enter proposals until 6 July 2022 23:59 
    (Europe/Berlin)</strong>.
