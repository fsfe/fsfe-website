<h2>Laundruino - The laundry hack and laser sharks</h2>

<p>FSFE Fellow Michael Clemens has a solution for all of you out there who want
to know when their laundry in the washing machine is done. <a
  href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/clemens/2011/08/05/the-arduino-enabled-washing-machine/">In
  his article he explains </a> how to build get a "Laundruino", based on the
Free Software microcontroller <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Arduino</a>, which informs you of
the status of your laundry cycle.  </p>

<p>During his research for a <a
  href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/mk/?p=828">radio interview (German) </a> about a
teenager who built a Free Software earthquake detection system for under 100
EUR, your editor was delighted to find many similar projects, such as how to
make free hardware based <a
  href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-wall-avoiding-Robot!/">simple
  robots</a>, <a
  href="http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Arduino-Weather-Station-Thermostat/">weather
  stations</a>, <a
  href="http://www.makershed.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=mkca1">a
  blimp</a>, an <a
  href="http://hacknmod.com/hack/high-speed-photography-how-to-trigger-using-arduino/">installation
  to make high speed pictures </a> and <a
  href="http://wiki.makerbot.com/thingomatic">3D-makerbots</a>.</p>

<p>These creative and educational guides are the result of people sharing
blueprints and source code, and are made possible by the fact that the authors
are able to change how these computers work. They can modify them, and share
their knowledge and ideas with others. With Free Software and free hardware,
people can really understand the technology that surrounds them, and change it
to meet their needs. And who knows, maybe soon your editor's dream of sharks
with lasers will become reality.</p>
