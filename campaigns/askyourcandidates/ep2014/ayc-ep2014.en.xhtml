		<p>In May 22 to 25 2014, people all across the European Union are asked to vote for European Parliament for the next 5 years. This is a good time to ask the candidates about their support of Free Software and Open Standards. It is very easy to participate, we offer a pact you can use, templates and we take of public awareness.</p>

	<h2>The written pact</h2>
	
	<h3>Title: Freedom Pact</h3>
	
	<p>I am [ ... insert name here ... ],<br />
	I am a member of [ ... insert name of party here ... ]<br />
	from [ ... insert name of country here ... ]<br />
	and I am a candidate in the European elections 2014.</p>
	
	<h4>Considering that:</h4>
	 <p>Access to software determines who may participate in a society where most interactions rely on digital technologies;</p>

	 <p>Free Software, which everyone may use, study, share and improve, enables political, economic, and cultural participation for everyone;</p>

	 <p>The use of Open Standards is critical to achieve interoperability between different IT systems in Europe, and ensure the long-term accessibility of information; </p>

	 <p>Software patents are incompatible with Free Software and are a menace to society and economy, because they restrict innovation, damage businesses and put collaborative creativity in great danger;</p>

	 <p>Free Software  helps to boost European economy by enabling small and medium sized  companies to compete on a local and regional level against existing  software monopolies;</p>

	 <p>Free Software is essential for public bodies to break free from vendor lock-in, obtain value for money, and promote the growth of European businesses;</p>

	<h4>I pledge to:</h4>

	  <ul>
	    <li>promote the use of Free Software in all areas of public life, in particular in the educational sector, so that students can learn in freedom</li>
	    <li>promote legislation to make Free Software the first choice in public procurement throughout Europe </li>
	    <li>promote policies in favour of Free Software, and oppose policies that discriminate against it.</li>
	    <li>promote the widest possible use of <a href="/activities/os/def.en.html">Open Standards</a> in the public sector, as well as the publication and archiving of all public data and documents in formats based on Open Standards.</li>
	    <li>ensure that all software developed with public funds is released as Free Software, so other administrations and the public can benefit from it.</li>
	    <li>strengthen consumers' rights so as to promote users control over their own devices and oppose any measures endangering it.</li>
	    <li>oppose any provision that aims at establishing software patents in Europe and work to end the European Patent Office's practice of  granting patents on computer-implemented inventions</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>[ ... your signature ... ], on [ ... insert date here ... ]</p>
