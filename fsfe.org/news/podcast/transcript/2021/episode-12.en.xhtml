Welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:17.020 --&gt; 00:20.360
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:20.360 --&gt; 00:24.260
We are a charity that empowers users to control technology.

00:24.260 --&gt; 00:28.220
I'm Matthias Kirchner, the President of the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:28.220 --&gt; 00:30.220
Our guest today is Till JÃ¤ger.

00:30.220 --&gt; 00:35.380
Till is a certified copyright and media law attorney and has worked for JBB Rechtsanvelidesens

00:35.380 --&gt; 00:37.060
2001.

00:37.060 --&gt; 00:42.540
His day job is to advise large and medium sized IT businesses as well as government authorities

00:42.540 --&gt; 00:48.500
and software developers on matter involving contracts, licensing and online use.

00:48.500 --&gt; 00:53.820
In his work he particularly focused on legal issues created by Free Software.

00:53.820 --&gt; 00:58.840
He also represented the GPL violations.org project in several lawsuits to enforce the

00:58.840 --&gt; 01:00.140
GNUGPL.

01:00.140 --&gt; 01:05.540
Has published several articles and books related to legal questions about Free Software.

01:05.540 --&gt; 01:10.020
And Till was also involved in a GNUGPL 3 drafting process.

01:10.020 --&gt; 01:11.340
Hello Till.

01:11.340 --&gt; 01:14.300
Hello Matthias, thanks for inviting me.

01:14.300 --&gt; 01:21.740
So when I looked back into when we met first I found out that that was in 2005 at the

01:21.740 --&gt; 01:24.340
GNUG Starg in Karlsruhe.

01:24.340 --&gt; 01:30.580
But actually I then also found out that even earlier in March 2004 I found the first

01:30.580 --&gt; 01:37.260
email between the two of us where you helped the FSFE to figure out some label law issues

01:37.260 --&gt; 01:41.460
so that I could be the first intern of the FSFE.

01:41.460 --&gt; 01:49.820
But when I found out about this stuff I realized that I never asked you how you actually

01:49.820 --&gt; 01:51.820
got involved in Free Software.

01:51.820 --&gt; 01:59.380
Oh, that's really a story a long time ago, even last millennium.

01:59.380 --&gt; 02:04.260
Actually it was in April 99.

02:04.260 --&gt; 02:11.020
I had a party in my apartment in Munich when I was doing my PhD thesis in the Max Planck

02:11.020 --&gt; 02:17.660
Institute about copyright matters and classical copyright law.

02:17.660 --&gt; 02:25.620
And the friend told me and another colleague, Axel Metzka, who is now a professor at the

02:25.620 --&gt; 02:33.900
Humboldt University here in Berlin, about the GPL and the license that permits unrestricted

02:33.900 --&gt; 02:39.380
modification of a copyrighted work and we said, oh wow, that's an interesting concept.

02:39.380 --&gt; 02:42.980
How could that work under a German copyright law?

02:42.980 --&gt; 02:50.140
And then we started digging a little bit into facts and asking people doing research,

02:50.140 --&gt; 02:58.180
said, wow, that's really interesting and there's nothing in Germany about Free Software

02:58.180 --&gt; 03:07.700
and a law and how it fits into the German legal system in particular, the copyright system.

03:07.700 --&gt; 03:20.540
And so we started to write an article for a law journal in I think it was May 99.

03:20.540 --&gt; 03:27.900
And when this article was published then it started a kind of a wave because as a first

03:27.900 --&gt; 03:35.140
mover people are asking you and one of the first people contacting us was Gail Graver.

03:35.140 --&gt; 03:41.780
And as you know, Gail Graver is the original founder of the Free Software Foundation

03:41.780 --&gt; 03:48.980
Europe and he said, well, you know, writing an article about the Open Source software

03:48.980 --&gt; 03:54.620
in the German legal system, do you know about free software and why do you don't call

03:54.620 --&gt; 03:56.740
it free software?

03:56.740 --&gt; 04:05.100
And it's true at that time in I think May 99, if you made a research, most people

04:05.100 --&gt; 04:11.980
spoke about Open Source software and not about free software although the term Open Source

04:11.980 --&gt; 04:15.460
software was invented in 98.

04:15.460 --&gt; 04:23.700
So not even one year later, that was a prevailing term and so we started to discuss things.

04:23.700 --&gt; 04:25.940
So that was the first and world one.

04:25.940 --&gt; 04:26.940
Ah, okay.

04:26.940 --&gt; 04:31.380
So that's how you then got in contact with Georg and the Georg was also then the person

04:31.380 --&gt; 04:33.940
who introduced the two of us.

04:33.940 --&gt; 04:42.300
So in, so one of the things that you're most famous for is the, is the, the court case,

04:42.300 --&gt; 04:47.140
the first court case in the German court, which was about a new GPL together with Harald

04:47.140 --&gt; 04:48.140
Veltem.

04:48.140 --&gt; 04:50.700
That was in 2004.

04:50.700 --&gt; 04:53.900
Can you tell us a little bit more about this decision?

04:53.900 --&gt; 05:03.260
Yeah, I think of course it should be Harald to explain that, but Harald is very transparent

05:03.260 --&gt; 05:06.940
about his ideas and why he did that enforcement.

05:06.940 --&gt; 05:14.140
So it's, it's, it's not a secret or it's something I could not, could not tell you.

05:14.140 --&gt; 05:23.020
And at that time, Harald was one of the first people concerned about GPL violations on the

05:23.020 --&gt; 05:27.380
one hand and on the other hand, he was not afraid of lawyers.

05:27.380 --&gt; 05:33.500
And as you know, in, in the field of developers, you, you will find a lot of people who are

05:33.500 --&gt; 05:37.500
not really interested to have too much contact to lawyers.

05:37.500 --&gt; 05:40.140
Harald is different in many ways.

05:40.140 --&gt; 05:49.860
And so he wrote in, I think about 10 companies producing root routers and, and other stuff,

05:49.860 --&gt; 05:56.980
explaining that there's a GPL violation and what to do and asking for the source code

05:56.980 --&gt; 06:03.540
and stuff like that, with 10 letters at, I think, was CBIT trade fair, where he was walking

06:03.540 --&gt; 06:08.860
around and handing out those papers to the companies present at CBIT in Hanover, right?

06:08.860 --&gt; 06:09.860
Exactly.

06:09.860 --&gt; 06:12.300
And yeah, what was the reaction?

06:12.300 --&gt; 06:17.820
If I asked that in my trainings, the only question that's always correctly answered because

06:17.820 --&gt; 06:19.980
people say, oh, of course, nothing.

06:19.980 --&gt; 06:20.980
And that's true.

06:20.980 --&gt; 06:22.780
He got no response.

06:22.780 --&gt; 06:28.660
And then he tried to contact the Free Software Foundation in the US, who is far away, could

06:28.660 --&gt; 06:31.980
not really do something here in Europe.

06:31.980 --&gt; 06:39.660
And then he contacted me as a member of IFROS, the Institute of Legal Questions on Free

06:39.660 --&gt; 06:45.860
and Open Source Software that I co-founded with Axel Medzka in the year 2000.

06:45.860 --&gt; 06:52.540
So he contacted us and said, what is, from the legal perspective, can we enforce the

06:52.540 --&gt; 06:55.780
GPL as that possible?

06:55.780 --&gt; 07:04.820
And I told him, well, you know, on high C, and at court, there's always something, you

07:04.820 --&gt; 07:08.660
are not completely sure if it works or not.

07:08.660 --&gt; 07:12.620
And we cannot see any other court cases at that time.

07:12.620 --&gt; 07:15.100
It probably would be the first one.

07:15.100 --&gt; 07:21.420
So if you want to go to court, it's obvious that there is a certain risk.

07:21.420 --&gt; 07:28.860
And he asked, so what's the risk and what how much I do I have to pay and I told him.

07:28.860 --&gt; 07:33.740
And he was very clear in his decision, said, okay, I take that risk, I owe that personal

07:33.740 --&gt; 07:37.340
financial risk to go to court and try to enforce.

07:37.340 --&gt; 07:41.940
So that's how it started.

07:41.940 --&gt; 07:44.860
So just because you mentioned it, that he could also talk about it.

07:44.860 --&gt; 07:49.020
We also talked with Harald already before about some other topics.

07:49.020 --&gt; 07:53.180
And you can listen to that episode when you go back to the archive.

07:53.180 --&gt; 07:59.700
But back on this topic here, so then in 2004, that was then the first case.

07:59.700 --&gt; 08:00.860
What was this about?

08:00.860 --&gt; 08:02.900
So you started with Harald.

08:02.900 --&gt; 08:07.700
He was convinced, okay, I take this risk, I want to do this, I want to have the licenses

08:07.700 --&gt; 08:08.700
enforced.

08:08.700 --&gt; 08:15.260
Yeah, I think the first case was the onnet case and that was settled out of court.

08:15.260 --&gt; 08:17.860
So we made a settlement.

08:18.860 --&gt; 08:23.580
And the first case at court was the side-com case.

08:23.580 --&gt; 08:28.060
So we, the usual thing is under German law, you're sending a season.

08:28.060 --&gt; 08:32.020
This is later on asking to fix the problem.

08:32.020 --&gt; 08:38.300
Then we received not a declaration to season this is, but some blah, blah.

08:38.300 --&gt; 08:45.420
That was not really fixing the problem, not no interest into entering into a settlement

08:45.420 --&gt; 08:52.820
to make that out of court, and then yeah, we filed an application for preliminary injection

08:52.820 --&gt; 08:56.940
at the Munich district court.

08:56.940 --&gt; 09:03.620
And yeah, under German law, if there is copyright violation and we convince that was a crucial

09:03.620 --&gt; 09:10.500
point in that case to convincing the court, that is not just a violation of a contractual

09:10.500 --&gt; 09:13.940
agreement, but it's copyright infringement.

09:13.940 --&gt; 09:21.420
Which was the hot topic from the legal perspective and the court agreed, and then it's, you

09:21.420 --&gt; 09:24.700
receive a preliminary injection in a few days.

09:24.700 --&gt; 09:30.580
And that means that the company in this case side-com is not permitted to redistribute

09:30.580 --&gt; 09:37.060
the product anymore, as long as they are not GPL compliant.

09:37.060 --&gt; 09:38.060
What happened next?

09:38.460 --&gt; 09:44.780
Yeah, well, from the case, they made an objection.

09:44.780 --&gt; 09:50.060
On the first place, if you go to court for an application, the court does not really ask

09:50.060 --&gt; 09:59.860
the defendant to explain so, but they just say, okay, if you are, the facts are correct,

09:59.860 --&gt; 10:06.500
that you have provided, and you have to give in declaration that all the facts are correct.

10:06.500 --&gt; 10:12.980
And then it's a copyright infringement, and then side-com made an objection, and then

10:12.980 --&gt; 10:20.140
there's a discussion at court, and then there's also a judgment with reasons.

10:20.140 --&gt; 10:24.340
And this judgment is also translated into English.

10:24.340 --&gt; 10:33.460
Is an important first court judgment about how a violation of GPL ends up in a copyright

10:33.460 --&gt; 10:37.020
infringement, what are the reasons for that and how does it work?

10:37.020 --&gt; 10:42.020
So that is an important first case.

10:42.020 --&gt; 10:49.300
And yeah, what happens then, a lot of developments and new cases, so I think it was not the intention

10:49.300 --&gt; 10:57.740
of Harold really to do that at large scale, but he was a little bit pushed by other developers

10:57.740 --&gt; 11:02.020
who are not interested to do them themselves.

11:02.060 --&gt; 11:10.060
He said, oh, look here, this product, or look here, it's also a Linux-based embedded system.

11:10.060 --&gt; 11:15.740
We do not receive the source code, there's no information about the license, and so on.

11:15.740 --&gt; 11:22.700
And that was the reason that Harold founded GPL violations.org and started to do more

11:22.700 --&gt; 11:25.340
enforcement on the one hand.

11:25.340 --&gt; 11:30.780
But also, I think he was one of the first ones to provide compliance information.

11:30.780 --&gt; 11:36.940
So if you look at the website, you will find FAQs about how to provide a complete corresponding

11:36.940 --&gt; 11:37.940
source code.

11:37.940 --&gt; 11:42.060
What are your obligations under the GPL?

11:42.060 --&gt; 11:50.940
So it was not just enforcing it, but also explaining to bring companies into compliance.

11:50.940 --&gt; 12:00.060
And I think that's an important point of that enforcement that he initiated compliance

12:00.060 --&gt; 12:03.980
in the whole IT industry, I would say.

12:03.980 --&gt; 12:10.860
Yeah, Harold was also a big driver to help the FSV to set up the FSV legal network,

12:10.860 --&gt; 12:15.700
where we also wanted to make sure that more people know about compliance work and more

12:15.700 --&gt; 12:22.300
people know about what they can do to make sure that they don't end up with products,

12:22.300 --&gt; 12:25.940
which are violating free software licenses.

12:25.940 --&gt; 12:34.980
So what do you see when you look back now from the early days to nowadays?

12:34.980 --&gt; 12:42.180
Do you think that the way how compliance work is done changed a lot through the availability

12:42.180 --&gt; 12:50.020
of more information about how to use licenses and how to try to be compliant?

12:50.420 --&gt; 12:56.980
Oh yeah, there's tremendous development, that's crazy.

12:56.980 --&gt; 13:04.340
Because in the beginning, you have seen a few companies exchanging some PowerPoint slides

13:04.340 --&gt; 13:10.140
to say, oh, what we are doing, we are providing simple things.

13:10.140 --&gt; 13:18.100
But if you start to think more about compliance and how to implement that into a company process,

13:18.100 --&gt; 13:26.420
then there are new questions, for example, license compatibility.

13:26.420 --&gt; 13:30.420
How do you have to fulfill all the license obligations?

13:30.420 --&gt; 13:32.020
What are the license obligations?

13:32.020 --&gt; 13:33.860
How to interpret licenses?

13:33.860 --&gt; 13:40.420
For example, complex licenses as LGBL, that's not easy at all.

13:40.420 --&gt; 13:46.580
And that needs a lot of discussion explanation and exchange.

13:46.580 --&gt; 13:54.100
And most company lawyers have not enough time to really dig into all the details.

13:54.100 --&gt; 14:03.540
And if I'm right, I would say the majority of people working within companies are not lawyers.

14:03.540 --&gt; 14:10.740
But engineers and engineers can handle legal compliance stuff,

14:10.740 --&gt; 14:13.540
but they need input from the legal side.

14:13.540 --&gt; 14:20.580
And there was always a lack on legal information in this field that is easy, accessible,

14:20.580 --&gt; 14:26.820
and that can be practically used by compliance people within companies.

14:26.820 --&gt; 14:35.220
And I think that is one of the important things that Free Software Foundation Europe provided,

14:36.180 --&gt; 14:44.580
starting from the legal and licensing workshop up to the legal network and exchanging emails,

14:44.580 --&gt; 14:48.500
just asking your question, discussing how to do that best.

14:49.540 --&gt; 14:53.380
Yeah, that helps, I think a lot.

14:53.940 --&gt; 15:00.900
And nowadays we see that big companies have their own free and open-source software compliance

15:01.860 --&gt; 15:06.660
departments that were unthinkable if you go 15 years ago.

15:07.620 --&gt; 15:11.940
But yeah, sometimes they created their own problems, I would say.

15:13.940 --&gt; 15:19.940
But on the other hand, the improvement is relevant.

15:19.940 --&gt; 15:25.620
That's obvious. Nowadays you get much more products which are

15:25.620 --&gt; 15:32.980
compliant or nearly compliant. And if you contact the company, then in most cases you will

15:32.980 --&gt; 15:40.900
receive a response. And not as with Harold 15 years ago, just no response because nobody has

15:40.900 --&gt; 15:47.460
a response. You just mentioned that they also created some problems through that.

15:48.660 --&gt; 15:52.340
What kind of problems are you thinking about? Is that some companies that have more knowledge

15:52.900 --&gt; 15:58.020
and now have a better defense that they try to circumvent the obligations they have through

15:58.020 --&gt; 16:02.180
some free software licenses or what kind of problems are you thinking about?

16:02.180 --&gt; 16:13.380
Well, I would say creating problem means, for example, that you look into the license text

16:14.100 --&gt; 16:19.860
made a very thorough interpretation, say, oh, I'm unsure about how to do that.

16:19.860 --&gt; 16:26.820
And then I have the strictest interpretation and I fulfill the license with regard to

16:26.820 --&gt; 16:34.500
the strictest interpretation. And if one player in the IT market is providing that compliance

16:34.500 --&gt; 16:40.580
on the strictest level, others say, oh, let's do the same way, it seems to be necessary.

16:40.580 --&gt; 16:48.820
So that is what we can see sometimes the compliance is stricter than what perhaps most developers would

16:48.820 --&gt; 16:59.220
expect, which makes more work, more problems to give you an example. Is it really necessary to

16:59.220 --&gt; 17:10.900
extract all copyright notices from a huge software package and to provide it independently

17:10.900 --&gt; 17:17.620
from the source code? That's a question you can ask. Nowadays it's the usual way, so you get a

17:17.620 --&gt; 17:23.060
file with a long list of copyright notices. I'm asking you who is reading that nobody.

17:23.700 --&gt; 17:29.140
And also why not just offering the source code and people who are interested can look into the

17:29.140 --&gt; 17:35.220
source code, who are world-witch code. So from that's from the practical point of view, perhaps

17:36.980 --&gt; 17:45.620
yeah, a little bit of over fulfilling, overcompliance. On the other hand, if you do not want to risk

17:46.340 --&gt; 17:53.220
a lawsuit, if you don't want to risk a copyright infringement, you're careful. And I would say

17:53.220 --&gt; 18:00.100
this is perhaps one of the biggest problems in this field because there's not enough exchange

18:00.100 --&gt; 18:07.380
between compliance people and developers on the one hand. And on the other hand, we have licenses

18:08.340 --&gt; 18:16.900
which are 30 years old or even even older. And 30 years ago it was the usual thing that you

18:16.900 --&gt; 18:24.660
had one program, one license and perhaps one to three copyright holders. Nowadays you have software

18:24.660 --&gt; 18:34.260
with 800 components, 70 licenses and hundreds of thousands of copyright owners. And the licenses

18:34.340 --&gt; 18:40.980
are not written for that purpose. And the question is, is that really what people are interested in,

18:40.980 --&gt; 18:46.420
what developers are interested in, or are they interested in easy access to the source code,

18:46.420 --&gt; 18:55.540
and from a technical perspective. So that that's perhaps a follow-up of the negative side of

18:55.540 --&gt; 19:02.660
that compliance work. When the FSFE, when we started the little network, one of the reasons was

19:02.660 --&gt; 19:07.860
also at that time that we heard from a lot of developers that they want to use more free software

19:07.860 --&gt; 19:14.020
in their companies. But then their legal department was blocking. No, no, we cannot use that because

19:14.020 --&gt; 19:21.460
when we use GPL software, we have to publish all the software from our company or some other

19:21.460 --&gt; 19:28.740
strange argumentation there. So what you described there, for a long time I had impression that

19:28.740 --&gt; 19:33.700
it helped a lot of developers that the legal departments then were clearing things and they were

19:33.700 --&gt; 19:39.700
allowed to use free software. Now with this very strict interpretation, do you also think that

19:39.700 --&gt; 19:45.700
this is then something which not just adds work for the lawyers there and compliance departments,

19:45.700 --&gt; 19:50.260
but also for the developers and companies if their legal departments are too strict?

19:50.740 --&gt; 19:59.540
Well, I would say yeah, there is of course overhead, but on the other hand, if you want to have

19:59.540 --&gt; 20:05.460
a compliant product, you need really to know what you're using, what the licenses are, otherwise

20:05.460 --&gt; 20:12.500
you're not able to comply with such licenses. And therefore, I would say in most cases,

20:13.460 --&gt; 20:20.980
this is not too restrictive for developers. There has been a lot of change. It's true that in the

20:20.980 --&gt; 20:28.260
past some companies said you're not permitted to use free and Open Source software in your products

20:28.260 --&gt; 20:34.180
that changed a lot because everybody knows it's impossible now for days to write your software

20:34.180 --&gt; 20:43.220
without where your takes too much time, too much costs. Nowadays, I would say I don't know any

20:43.220 --&gt; 20:52.180
clients of our law firm producing proprietary software without any free and Open Source components

20:52.180 --&gt; 20:59.380
does not exist. First, little firmware or something like that next to the hardware that could happen,

20:59.860 --&gt; 21:08.740
but most software contains free software at least partly. And therefore, it's very helpful,

21:08.740 --&gt; 21:16.980
so it's not nowadays, it's not, oh, we have something strange license, so we don't want to do that.

21:16.980 --&gt; 21:27.220
Nowadays, it's accepted and people know, well, we have to do a certain process to

21:27.220 --&gt; 21:34.900
comply with the license, so that is that's usual business, I would say. Do you think that most of

21:36.340 --&gt; 21:42.820
so that the legal cases in front of court that they helped a lot in making more companies out

21:42.820 --&gt; 21:53.220
there on GPL compliant? Yes, to be honest, yes. If you have not the evidence that they can

21:53.220 --&gt; 22:01.300
happen something, then people wait, they just wait what will happen. But if you have an example,

22:01.300 --&gt; 22:07.700
a court case that there's look here, that are the legal consequences, then they start considering

22:07.700 --&gt; 22:18.820
and dealing with that problem. So I would say, yes, it had an impact, whether or not this is

22:18.820 --&gt; 22:27.860
one five 10 or 20 cases, I'm not sure that that makes a big deal, but that you can see it is

22:27.860 --&gt; 22:36.660
enforceable and there are people who are interested that there's really compliance with the licenses

22:36.660 --&gt; 22:41.540
that makes a major difference here. Do you think when you look back to all those years of compliance

22:41.620 --&gt; 22:49.060
work, there are some cases which stand out of all those cases, which are very unique or

22:49.940 --&gt; 22:55.780
very famous? Well, I would say, of course, the first one is perhaps the most important one.

22:56.500 --&gt; 23:04.420
There are a few others, also some of them out of court, which might have the big influence because

23:05.380 --&gt; 23:12.660
this was enforcement with a big player and some of the big players started to do internal

23:12.660 --&gt; 23:21.460
enforcement work that has an impact for the whole supply chain. So I guess there are some cases,

23:21.460 --&gt; 23:30.580
I don't want to name them here, but where the enforcement with regard to the company has changed

23:30.580 --&gt; 23:40.660
a lot. From the cases at court, well, of course, there are always new aspects to discuss at court,

23:42.260 --&gt; 23:53.860
and I would perhaps take one and not absolutely happy with outcome. This was the Skype case from 2007

23:54.500 --&gt; 24:01.860
and it's a long story why that case came to court. I would say it was not necessary. It was

24:02.660 --&gt; 24:09.220
they tried to trick her a little bit and the outcome was that the court said, well,

24:10.420 --&gt; 24:19.140
providing the source code on a web server for download is not complying with GPL version 2,

24:20.020 --&gt; 24:26.500
which is true from the mere wording of the license because the license says you have to provide a

24:26.500 --&gt; 24:36.340
written offer on either on the one hand or you have to provide the source code on a device,

24:36.340 --&gt; 24:44.100
on a typical device for exchanging software. That means a CD or a DVD or a USB

24:44.100 --&gt; 24:52.180
stake or something like that, but just providing it for download is not sufficient. This is true in 1991

24:52.180 --&gt; 25:00.180
that was the idea of the Free Software Foundation when the FSF wrote GPL version 2 because at that

25:00.180 --&gt; 25:07.540
time it was more expensive to download the program instead of sending it on a data carrier.

25:08.420 --&gt; 25:18.260
But in 2007 or in nowadays, of course, that does not make really sense. So I would prefer that

25:19.540 --&gt; 25:27.460
courts look not so much in the mere wording of the license but also in the intention and if you

25:27.460 --&gt; 25:34.020
have access to the source code in which rate does not really matter. Is that something which you

25:34.020 --&gt; 25:42.340
consider quite unique to Germany where most of the cases you worked on are happening or is that

25:42.340 --&gt; 25:47.940
something you also saw in other countries that there are those very strict interpretations there?

25:49.460 --&gt; 25:55.700
This is difficult to say because in the cases in most other countries are not so much

25:55.860 --&gt; 26:01.140
classical enforcement cases where they are not so much about interpretation details

26:02.100 --&gt; 26:09.380
or they are settled though they have not a detailed court decision with all the explanation so

26:10.500 --&gt; 26:16.500
I cannot really tell you how the situation would be in courts from other countries.

26:18.020 --&gt; 26:25.380
So that's still an open question and it could change so it's not something that is for all time

26:25.380 --&gt; 26:33.300
needs to be as in this Skype decision but this is what we have at the moment and it makes

26:33.300 --&gt; 26:43.060
compliance work more difficult than it should be. And staying on the topic of difference between

26:43.060 --&gt; 26:50.180
countries in the GnuGPL version 3 drafting process you have been involved there together with

26:50.180 --&gt; 26:57.220
Axel Metzger and you focused a lot on how to make sure that the newer version of the GnuGPL

26:57.220 --&gt; 27:06.900
will then also work in different jurisdictions. So looking back those years now do you think that

27:06.900 --&gt; 27:15.620
this was accomplished or what topics do you see where there would need to be changed to get to this

27:15.620 --&gt; 27:23.060
goal that the GPL works in all countries? Well I think there's a lot of progress to be honest.

27:23.620 --&gt; 27:30.980
So this was initially an idea by the Free Software Foundation in the US to say well

27:32.980 --&gt; 27:42.660
free software is used worldwide. Yes our license was written under the impression of US law.

27:42.660 --&gt; 27:50.580
We want to change that though that's a very important step. And what you can see in GnuGPL

27:50.580 --&gt; 28:00.180
version 3 is the terms are not the terms directly from US law, US copyright egg and so on but

28:00.980 --&gt; 28:07.700
they are defined there are more general terms with exoplanations so that in other countries

28:08.100 --&gt; 28:14.340
if you can understand English of course they are translations and so on but then you can better

28:14.340 --&gt; 28:23.780
understand what is the purpose of a term or what is really the intention of the license

28:23.780 --&gt; 28:31.860
condition to give you an example in GPL version 2 get the term distribution all the license

28:31.940 --&gt; 28:40.180
conditions depend on the distribution but what is distribution? And there is a term distribution

28:40.180 --&gt; 28:47.700
in US copyright law but even the interpretation of that term within the US is not that easy and

28:47.700 --&gt; 28:55.620
for people from outside the US it's even more difficult. And in GPL 3 you have the term

28:55.700 --&gt; 29:02.340
convey and the term convey is defined is providing a copy so that's pretty clear

29:03.460 --&gt; 29:10.820
and you have much more cases that are clearly covered and what is inside and outside of conveying.

29:10.820 --&gt; 29:19.540
So this is definitely progress. We see that also in other licenses so for example Eclipse

29:19.620 --&gt; 29:26.340
public license version 1 has a choice of law clause version 2 does not have such a clause

29:26.340 --&gt; 29:32.820
because nowadays in the Eclipse world you have a lot of European companies involved

29:33.620 --&gt; 29:44.340
and so it's more general and yeah I would say we made a lot of progress. It's also exchanging

29:44.420 --&gt; 29:51.220
ideas what is meant how do you comply with the license condition that helps a lot so that you

29:51.220 --&gt; 29:57.940
have a worldwide stable understanding of what you have to do and what not.

30:01.620 --&gt; 30:07.060
From your experience besides such terms where there is a lot of discussion what exactly does

30:07.060 --&gt; 30:16.500
that mean distribution in a license are there some other examples of issues around free

30:16.500 --&gt; 30:22.420
software licensing that you encounter that people have problems understanding that and regularly

30:22.420 --&gt; 30:26.660
misunderstand that and you have to explain that to every client again and again.

30:26.740 --&gt; 30:39.620
Yeah well there are some technical aspects so for example in the lesser general public license what

30:39.620 --&gt; 30:49.140
does it mean that you are enabled to re-link your software with the LGPR library so if you have

30:49.140 --&gt; 30:56.740
a lawyer who never wrote a program was not heavily involved in software programming it's normal

30:56.740 --&gt; 31:03.620
that they do not know what is linking libraries or the static or dynamic linking and stuff like

31:03.620 --&gt; 31:11.460
that of course you have to explain that to make it provide an understanding of what the license

31:11.460 --&gt; 31:20.020
mean it's a license that's heavily driven by developers for the purpose of developers and so

31:20.020 --&gt; 31:30.500
for loritz it's mostly difficult to understand and we can see that also free software provided

31:31.220 --&gt; 31:40.020
well I wouldn't say problems but required interpretations that were not necessary under proprietary

31:40.100 --&gt; 31:46.900
proprietary software licensing though what is a derivative work that is a general question of

31:46.900 --&gt; 31:55.300
copyright law we know what a derivative work is for photographs music or other works but we don't

31:55.300 --&gt; 32:04.180
know it for software and well if you have no access to the program if you have not the permission to

32:04.260 --&gt; 32:13.540
change it that question does not really matter but free software provides the right to modify and to

32:13.540 --&gt; 32:21.380
create a derivative work so it does matter the copy left does matter and then people ask so what

32:21.380 --&gt; 32:29.540
is a derivative work in that technical situation and but personally I don't know it because it does

32:29.540 --&gt; 32:35.860
not it's not written in the lower there's different interpretation around you have no case law

32:35.860 --&gt; 32:44.500
about this question so it's still an open question of course there is a common understanding for a

32:44.500 --&gt; 32:55.300
lot of technical situations but in general it's extremely difficult to say what is a derivative

32:55.380 --&gt; 33:03.140
work and what's not and that is the reason for that is software is different from other copyrighted

33:03.140 --&gt; 33:12.180
work and when there was a decision to protect computer programs by copyright of course

33:12.820 --&gt; 33:21.380
they was was not consideration of all potential problems or differences from computer problems

33:21.380 --&gt; 33:28.820
compared to other works so a lot of the work of you also seems to involve that you have to

33:29.460 --&gt; 33:36.020
explain technical things to other people with legal background and then a lot of legal

33:36.740 --&gt; 33:43.060
background to the people from the technical background that's true that's a big part of my work

33:43.940 --&gt; 33:52.900
and honestly it's easier to explain law to engineers than why it's worth a technical

33:52.900 --&gt; 34:01.860
stuff to lawyers so I'm I'm doing training trainings for companies but also teaching at the

34:01.860 --&gt; 34:10.340
university and yeah to explain all that technical background of course in in a law course you have

34:10.340 --&gt; 34:16.500
not the time to go really into the details of software programming and for those people who have

34:16.500 --&gt; 34:25.140
no idea about how that works it's difficult it's definitely difficult and there is a big lack of

34:25.140 --&gt; 34:35.140
people with that knowledge technical side and legal side and but it's required so a lot of basic

34:35.220 --&gt; 34:42.580
explanations about how version control systems work for example linking yeah okay it has

34:42.580 --&gt; 34:51.060
everything has a legal impact so for example if if you use Git and you have all the modifications

34:51.060 --&gt; 34:57.940
and who made that commit in the Git history yeah that complies with the requirement of the of the

34:57.940 --&gt; 35:04.900
GPL to provide the the modification information and the date of the modification if you don't know how

35:04.980 --&gt; 35:11.300
that works you would say oh let's write that in and in the in the source header if you ignore the

35:11.300 --&gt; 35:22.260
source header well now you you worked in free software now for over 20 years what do you think the

35:22.260 --&gt; 35:31.700
next 10 years what are the main challenges in the the legal area I think with perspective to free

35:31.700 --&gt; 35:38.820
software would say there are two big challenges the first one is artificial intelligence

35:40.180 --&gt; 35:48.500
though that will have a big impact also on copyright law in general so it started with a

35:48.500 --&gt; 35:57.220
discussion about GitHub co-pilot for example so but the the question behind that is can you see

35:57.220 --&gt; 36:04.500
that from the code whether it's written by a system of artificial intelligence or by

36:04.500 --&gt; 36:12.340
a human being only if it's from a human being it's protected by copyright perhaps copyright will

36:12.340 --&gt; 36:21.300
change you have nowadays your programs that are able to to paint the picture you don't know

36:21.380 --&gt; 36:30.660
that the painter is it from from artificial intelligence so there are a lot of open questions things

36:30.660 --&gt; 36:38.180
new to think to say what is protected what's not protected that will be very interesting I think that

36:38.180 --&gt; 36:48.100
is will give a lot of to discuss and to rethink in the next years and from with regard to

36:49.060 --&gt; 36:56.740
free and Open Source licensing I would say simplification is important to reduce the work

36:56.740 --&gt; 37:07.220
compliance work on the one hand and on the other hand to facilitate more interoperability to

37:07.220 --&gt; 37:16.660
facilitate more license compatibility because there is actually no reasons for that licenses are

37:17.300 --&gt; 37:23.940
incompatible there is no interest in incompatibility and this is historically grown problem

37:25.060 --&gt; 37:31.860
and we have to provide solutions and simplification of licenses is the main solution for more

37:33.140 --&gt; 37:42.660
license compatibility till we unfortunately have to come to an end but one of the questions I ask

37:42.740 --&gt; 37:51.380
every participant of this podcast is are there any people out there any programs projects that

37:51.380 --&gt; 37:58.420
you would like to thank for their work for free software any programs you like to use any people

37:58.420 --&gt; 38:05.780
whom you admire for their work in free software oh there are a lot a lot of people to be honest

38:05.940 --&gt; 38:14.900
and perhaps to name a few of them representative for many others to be honest is of course Harout

38:15.620 --&gt; 38:21.380
because he explained me a lot of technical stuff that I wouldn't know without him

38:22.180 --&gt; 38:29.380
and as you mentioned technical knowledge for lawyers is very important and you have to people

38:29.460 --&gt; 38:37.700
who have the patients to explain that stuff and are very grateful for that help that he made

38:38.580 --&gt; 38:47.700
and with regard to projects I use a lot of free software and I want to thank the people doing

38:48.340 --&gt; 38:56.820
distributions Linux distributions because that is a lot of work on the one hand and on the other

38:56.820 --&gt; 39:06.100
hand it helps non-developers to use free and source software and I'm very thankful for that work

39:07.140 --&gt; 39:13.620
great thank you very much till for all the other listeners here please also don't wait till

39:13.620 --&gt; 39:18.900
our I love free software day on the 14th of February but also thank other developers out there for

39:18.900 --&gt; 39:26.660
their work and yes still I am really sad that we already have to cut it off here but I'm quite

39:26.660 --&gt; 39:33.060
sure that we will have another episode in in the future again thank you very much for being here

39:33.940 --&gt; 39:39.940
