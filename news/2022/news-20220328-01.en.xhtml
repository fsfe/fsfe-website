  <h1>Anchor Free Software in the 2022 German Federal Budget!</h1>

 <p>The traffic light coalition must anchor its goals for the digitisation of Germany, based on Free Software, as set out in 
 the coalition agreement in the 2022 federal budget. Otherwise, there is a risk of cementing dependencies on individual 
 vendors and losing sovereignty and innovative power.</p> 


<p>Together with other associations and organisations such as the Open Source Business Alliance and the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany, the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) demands to include digital 
sovereignty in the 2022 federal budget and implement already announced initiatives for software freedom. In an open letter, the signatories address 
the government groups in the Bundestag and demand that the goals for the digitalisation of Germany, based on Free Software, as set out in 
the coalition agreement, also be anchored in the 2022 federal budget.</p>

<blockquote><em>"The right goal in the coalition agreement to advance digitisation through the use of Free Software must also be 
reflected in the government's concrete actions. Otherwise, there is a risk of cementing dependencies on individual vendors and 
losing sovereignty and innovative power. Digitisation that focuses on independence, sustainability, crisis resistance and economic 
success can only be achieved through the implementation of Free Software. The traffic light coalition is called upon to  provide 
necessary funds in the federal budget to prevent digitalisation from failing," explains Alexander Sander, Policy Consultant at FSFE.</em></blockquote>
 
<p>Free Software gives everyone the right to use, study, share and improve applications for any purpose. These freedoms ensure that 
similar applications do not have to be programmed from scratch every time and, thanks to transparent processes, others do not have 
to reinvent the wheel. In large projects, expertise and costs can be shared and applications paid for by the general public are 
available to all. This promotes innovation and saves tax payers money in the medium to long term. Dependencies on vendors are 
minimised and security issues can be fixed more easily. The Free Software Foundation Europe, together with over 200 organisations, 
is therefore calling for "Public Money? Public Code!"   - If it is public money, it should be public code as well. More information
