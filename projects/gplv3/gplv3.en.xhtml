<h1>GPLv3: Drafting version 3 of the GNU General Public License</h1>


<p>
  Welcome to FSFE's GPLv3 project coordination page.  Our goals are to
  raise awareness of the proposed changes, to help people to
  participate in the public consultation, and to produce educational
  materials to help people to make informed contributions.
</p>

<p>
  Much of FSFE's GPLv3 work is made possible by
  the <a href="http://fsfe.org">Fellowship of FSFE</a>.  To support
  the Fellowship, consider joining and encouraging others to do
  likewise.

<h2 id="intro">Introduction: What's happening</h2>

<p>
  On January 16th, 2006, a year-long public consultation process was
  launched for the drafting of version 3 of the GNU General Public
  License.  On that day, the first public discussion draft was
  published, and the gplv3.fsf.org web portal went on-line to collect
  public comments.
</p>

<p>
  On July 27th, the second draft was published, responding to six
  months of public comments.  You can look at the <a
  href="diff-draft1-draft2.html">changes from draft 1 to draft 2</a>,
  or the <a href="diff-gplv2-draft2.html">changes from GPL version 2
  to draft 2 of GPLv3</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Version 2 of the GNU GPL - the current official (non-draft) version
  - was published in 1991.
  The purpose of the GPL is to ensure that everyone who receives a
  copy of GPL-licenced software is free to use that software, to
  modify it, and to redistribute it in modified or unmodified form.
</p>

<p>
  Today it is by far the most used licence
  for <a href="/documents/freesoftware.html">Free Software</a>.
  The number of people who use software which is distributed under the
  terms of the GPL is somewhere in the region of 100s of millions.
</p>

<p>
  Version 3 will do the same job as version 2 but will be updated to
  account for changes in software's legal and technical environment,
  and to thwart new techniques devised in the past fifteen years to
  take the above freedoms away from software users.
</p>




<h2 id="participate">How to participate</h2>

<p>
  The public consultation is being managed by our sister organisation at the <a
