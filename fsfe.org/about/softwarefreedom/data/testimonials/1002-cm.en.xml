    “We are celebrating 40 years of the GNU project, 30 years of Debian and 25 years of
	the Open Source Initiative!
	
	Together, those three entities have contributed to defining and defending Free and
	Open Source software — software that is so prevalent in the stacks that power our
	world’s discovery and economy. The GNU project was key to initially launching that
	revolution: From the Manifesto to the functional software produced, the GNU project
	and the freedoms it granted have traced a path for computer science to evolve at the
	pace of other scientific disciplines. Without GNU and its freedoms, computer science
	risked remaining in the hands of a privileged few. Here is to the next 40 years of
	freedom!”
