<p>
The Fellowship of the Free Software Foundation Europe is a community of people united by their interest in Free Software and freedom in all aspects of the digital age. It is the easiest and most direct way to get involved with, remain informed about and support the work of the Free Software Foundation Europe.<br />
This is the place where we all come together. Not least for the cool features, namely the Cryptocard.
