    go to "New User via SSL" in the menu, to proceed you have to accept the
    savannah SSL certificate. Then you have should fill out the form; choose a
    login name, enter your password, confirm your password, enter your real
    name and your email address. 
    
    Now you will now receive a email from savannah, in order to complete your
    registration, visit the URL in the email. Accounts not confirmed after two
    days are deleted from the database.
    
    Enter your login name and your password. Now you are a registered user on
    Savannah. 

Howto Create a SSH Key

    In this step you have to create a SSH key to identify yourself to savannah.
    This has to be done one every machine from where you will access the CVS
    repository. To create a key you have to execute
    
        $ssh-keygen -t dsa 
    
    If you don't already have a key named id_dsa in your .ssh directory
    you only have to confirm the question in which file the key should be saved
    with enter.
    
    Then you have to choose a password for the SSH key and confirm it.
    
    
    Login in your savannah account. Choose "My Account Conf" from the menu,
    then "Register an SSH Public Key"
    
    Then copy the content of the file .ssh/id_dsa.pub (or the name you choose)
    into the key#1 field; confirm with update. After approximately two hours
    the key should be registered.

Howto Join FSFE project.

    Choose "Group Membership" in the top tabs then you can enter FSFE into the
    search box of "Request for Inclusion", activate the FSF Europe check box
    and enter a comment.
    
    Then you'll have to wait until someone of the administrators approve your
    request. After that you should see "FSF Europe" in the "Groups I'm
    Contributor of" after you login at savannah.


Howto checkout the Repository

    First you should add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:
        
        export CVS_RSH=ssh

    then create a directory for the repository and execute 

        $cvs -z3 -d username@savannah.gnu.org:/webcvs/fsfe co .
    
    Now you are asked for your SSH password. Enter it and confirm. If
    everything is alright now the website should be checked out.

    Note: You can also checkout the repository without a savannah account
          anonymously using 
    
            $cvs -z3 -d anoncvs@savannah.gnu.org:/webcvs/fsfe co .


Howto use CVS

    After you checked out the repository the first time, you should execute 

        $cvs update -d 

    in the fsfe directory every time before you work on a specific file. If you
    want to add new files to the repository you have to execute:
        
        $cvs add filename  

   and after that

        $cvs commit filename
    
    then you are asked for the changes. Describe briefly what you changed, or
    what you added. 

Tips
    
    If you add "ssh-agent &" to your .xsession you can hand over your SSH
    password to the SSH-agent with ssh-add; then you will not be asked for your
    password during your X-session.
