<h1>The FSFE
promotes freedom of software, hardware, and data</h1>

<p>The ZOOOM (3Os) Initiative
promotes innovation based on freedom of software,
hardware, and data. With its recent conclusion, the FSFE hopes to
inspire broader use and effective application of Free Software by
business, academia, and the public sector.</p>

<p>Free Software, Open Data and Open Hardware are essential building
blocks for a sustainable and trustworthy industrial and commercial
ecosystem. Nevertheless, business, academia, and the public sector 
sometimes lack important fundamental understandings of these topics, and 
as
a result many industries often develop systemic problems by matching
business models with inappropriate licensing frameworks, or even without
sufficient frameworks at all.</p>

<p>To help solve these problems, the FSFE became a partner of the <a href="https://zooom4u.eu/">ZOOOM Initiative</a> (3Os – Open Source
Software, Open Data, Open Hardware), that started in 2022. This European
project funded by the European Commission aimed to build competence and
raise awareness on the importance of proper management of these three
open assets (Software, Hardware, and Data). The FSFE contributed
specifically in the research and the development of educational
materials on various topics related to Free Software, tailored for
industrial and commercial needs. We are pleased to share the outcomes of
our collaborative work with our ZOOOM partners over the past 2
years.</p>

<h3>Innovative research involving open assets </h3>

<p>Together with our <a href="https://zooom4u.eu/index.php/about/zooom-team/">ZOOOM consortium 
partners</a>, we have conducted
innovative research to understand commonalities and interactions on the
issues faced when dealing collectively with Free Software, Open
Hardware, and Open Data. The results have been documented in <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10948750">a report that assists
stakeholders</a> with
understanding the 3Os and proposes strategies to align their business
models with the complexities characterizing each of these open
ecosystems. </p>

<p>To support this reporting, the FSFE also
conducted extensive research and analysis on Free Software legal issues
for business and innovation. As a result of this work, we have
contributed to <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10966136">a review of 
legal cases on issues related to the 3Os</a>, specifically on legal 
cases
related to Free Software. Those interested in an overview of legal
issues in open hardware and open data will also find this review
useful.</p>

<h3>Recommendations on Free Software AI licensing</h3>
<p>Another significant outcome of this European project was the creation
of <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10966136">a comprehensive paper 
on Free Software and openness in the area of artificial intelligence 
development</a>.
This paper examined the convergence of Free Software and AI focusing on
the legal aspects of licensing</p>

<p>In the paper, we considered the necessity to promote openness in a
manner that respects the principles of Free Software, especially in
light of the various challenges in achieving such openness in AI
licensing. In particular, we highlighted the uncoordinated growing
proliferation of licenses claiming to be “free and open source” in the
AI scene, but that actually impose extra limitations on software freedom
and that may lead to license incompatibility. </p>

<p>To improve the situation, we proposed three important
recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Preserving openness in AI by safeguarding <a href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html#freedoms">the Four Freedoms of 
Free Software</a>;</li>
<li>Keeping licensing of AI technologies cohesive and interoperable with
Free Software licenses;</li>
<li>Encouraging engagement with civil society actors in initiatives
aimed to make AI more open, accessible, transparent, and auditable.</li>
</ol>

<p>The drafting of these papers with our ZOOOM consortium partners has
also enabled us to raise awareness among the academic community about
the importance of Free Software and open concepts, as they relate to
software, hardware, and data.</p>

  project analysed this in detail from the perspective of Free
  Software.</figcaption>

<h3>Development of training materials </h3>
<p>In addition to these research activities, we contributed to the development of
<a href="https://zooom4u.eu/index.php/toolkit/">training materials</a> 
intended for any organisation – private or public – to equip users with
the knowledge and skills needed to navigate Free Software, open
hardware, and open data. The training toolkit can be especially useful 
for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across Europe with
the necessary skills to adopt strategies and evaluate business modules
that relate to open technologies.</p>

<h3>Successful outreach in Europe for Free Software</h3>
<p>The ZOOOM project also engaged in an extensive awareness campaign to
promote our work, and general awareness of the principles of Free
Software, Open Hardware, and Open Data. As part of this campaign, more
than 40 events were organised. The FSFE spoke at various conferences and
events across Europe, including at <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2750-codes-bound-by-ethics-the-rising-tide-of-non-free-software-licenses-in-ai-ecosystems/">FOSDEM
2024</a>, <a href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/dnEYF8Fs7NRNC7a2A2BvTz">DORS/CLUC
2024</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_4qp3BePqc&amp;list=PL1e89M45YLyvBD5RQvU155EoCGOjdOomF">and SFSCon
2022</a></p>
<p>Additionally, the ZOOOM consortium organized exclusive
meetups and events involving a broad range of stakeholders (academia,
public sector and business), to further promote Free Software in <a href="https://zooom4u.eu/index.php/2024/03/14/zooom-event-emerging-trends-in-open-technologies/">Ljubljana</a>,
<a href="https://zooom4u.eu/index.php/2024/06/12/zooom-at-the-open-festival-trento/">Trento</a>,
and <a href="https://zooom4u.eu/index.php/2024/09/20/zooom-final-conference-one-week-to-go-and-so-much-to-learn/">Brussels</a>.

<h3>Sustainability goal: open science</h3>

<p>In only two years, the ZOOOM project produced comprehensive research
merging aspects of Free Software, Open Data and Open Hardware. Focusing
on the importance of these assets for the future of AI, the initiative
not only produced scientific materials tackling legal and business
issues regarding Free Software, but also developed a series of
recommendations. The next steps are to deploy further the material
produced, engaging with organisations and individuals interested in
reusing and developing further the materials.</p>
