<h1>"I Love Free Software Day" 2023: Meet &amp; Connect</h1>

<p>On the 14th of February Free Software enthusiasts celebrated the 13th edition of the “I ❤️ Fee Software Day”! Hundreds of people and numerous organisations shared their love for Free Software and reached out to the ones behind these projects. Thank you for taking part in the celebration of our favourite type of software: Free Software.</p>

<p>For this years’ celebration of “I Love Free Software Day”, the Free Software Foundation Europe organised several meetups and events all across Europe. The FSFE local groups in Spain, England, Portugal, Greece, Germany, and Switzerland took up the call of the FSFE to get together and celebrate their love for software freedom in person. Even Free Software contributors from outside the FSFE joined the call and organised a meeting, like the one in Austria and Barcelona.</p>

<p>Apart from the visible presence on Twitter and in the Fediverse, the FSFE said <strong>thank you</strong>, in a more old-school way, to numerous projects with our <a hef="/contribute/spreadtheword.html#ilovefs">newly designed postcards</a>.</p>

<h3>Software Freedom Podcast episode with Karen Sandler</h3>

<p>For this years "I Love Free Software Day" Bonnie Mehring together with Karen Sandler, Executive Director of the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">software freedom conservancy</a> recorded a dedicated <a href="/news/podcast/episode-19.html">Software Freedom Podcast episode</a>. They talked about the rise in awareness of software freedom in western societies, with Karen getting an <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2023/feb/02/karen-honorary-doctorate/">honorary doctorate</a> from the KU Leuven for her work for software freedom. They then continue discussing Free Software on medical devices, on of the main topics Karen is advocating for.</p>


<h3>FSFE women's activity for the "I Love Free Software Day"</h3>

<p>A special activity was organised by the FSFE women’s team who reached out to women working in tech and thanked them for their contribution to Free Software. This was a wonderful and heart-warming experience for all people involved.</p>

<p>One of those who the FSFE’s women team thanked is Isabela Fernandes, the executive director of the Tor Project. Who said that we need a strong and diverse Free Software community.</p>
<p><blockquote>“We not only need Free Software to be strong and alive but we need it to be a safe community and a safe culture that includes everyone, women, LGBTQIA+, folks from all cultures and races”</blockquote></p>

<p>This activity was also a touching moment for the coordinator of the FSFE women’s team Antje Kazimiers and Gabriele Pohl, deputy coordinator of the team where glade the acitivy worked out so well and it was a real joy to see the outcome of it. 
<blockquote>"Seeing only a few people of your gender is a situation a lot of women* face in tech and also in Free Software communities, which can be challenging. Saying thank you was a way for us to recognize this. Knowing that there are many women* out there in a similar situation gives us the chance to feel connected with each other. So that we can be community by ourselves, which supports each other." by Antje Kazimiers</blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote>"I suppose every Free Software contributor rejoices at a 'thanks for your good work' and for a network of women* it was obvious to address female contributors ;-)" by Gabriele Pohl</blockquote></p>

<p>Those are just some of the actions that took place for this years “I Love Free Software Day”.
