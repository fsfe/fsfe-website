      <p>
    Open letter to Mr Borrell Fontelles, President of the European Parliament.
    On July 6th, European Parliament will have to decide on the "Software
  Patents" directive. By relying on undefined terms and ineffective
  limits, the text that the Council has handed to the Parliament would
  allow patents on software standards, business methods, and website
  development.
