    <name>FSFE Folder</name>
    <description>
      On the <a href="/about/printable/folder.en.F.pdf">inside of our FSFE folders</a>, there is written some core information about FSFE and our work, about Free Software and how to contribute. <br />
			These folders can be used as a briefcase for additional material with more information inside. In size A5, we normally put our <a href="#political-leaflets">political leaflets</a> and/or our Fellowship leaflets (<a href="#fellowship-leaflet">see next item</a>). Folders in size A4 can be useful in other contexts, for example at a conference.
