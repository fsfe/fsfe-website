    <title>The FSFE with a talk at the Open Source Lisbon in Lisbon, Portugal</title>

    <body>
      <p>Why does programmed software with taxpayers’ money is not released as a Free Software? We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for public sector must be made publicly available under a Free and Open Source Software licence.</p>
      <p>If it is public money, it should be public code as well. Code paid by all people should be available to all people!</p>
      <p>This talk of our Policy Manager Alexander Sander will provide a brief overview of the Free Software Foundation Europe’s (FSFE) previous and ongoing activities to foster software freedom in Europe, on the levels of politics, legal work with enterprises, and general public awareness.
