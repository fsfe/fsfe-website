	  <question>
	    <para>
	      What is GNU/Linux ?
	    </para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>
	      GNU/Linux is a multiuser, multitask operating system which can execute on a large number of hardware platforms (Intel x86, PowerPC, Alpha, SPARC, ARM, etc.).
	      The most important characteristic of this operating system, besides its technical qualities and its growing fame, lies in the fact that GNU/Linux is an assembly of &LLs;.
	    </para>
	    <para>
              The GNU/Linux system will often be mentioned in this document, essentially because the problems mentioned presently concern many users of this system. But these problems stay valid <emphasis>for every operating system</emphasis>

	  <question>
	    <para>
	      Why does one sometimes refer to GNU/Linux instead of Linux?
	    </para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>
              Introduced by Richard M. Stallman in 1984, GNU is a project of operating system consisting solely of &LLs;. The Linux kernel, a creation which began in 1991, is the last component that has allowed to achieve an autonomous operating system solely composed of &LL;. GNU/Linux is thus the conjunction of the project GNU and the Linux kernel. It is this set which is distributed today by Debian, Mandrake, RedHat, etc.

	      What is a free license ?
	    </para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>
              A license can be designated under the generic name of 
	      <quote>free license</quote> if it corresponds to the criteria 
	      of &LL; licences 
	      (a <ulink
	      url="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/license-list.htm">list is
	      available on the FSF's site</ulink>) 
	      or to &OS; licenses 
	      (a <ulink url="http://opensource.org/licenses">list is available on the on the &OSI;'s site</ulink>)
	    </para>
	    <para condition="long">
	      &LL; licenses correspond to the criteria stated by 
	      <ulink url="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">
		&LL; definition</ulink>.
	      &OS; licenses correspond to the criteria stated in 
	      <ulink url="http://opensource.org/docs/definition.html">
		&OS; definition</ulink>.
	    </para>
	    <!--
	    <para condition="long">
             Although many licenses appear in both these lists, they are not strictly identical, &LL; movement and the &OS; movement being based on different fundamental postulates.
	    </para>
	    <para condition="long">
             &OS; emphasizes the opening and efficiency of the computer software developments, while the foundations of the &LL; movement are freedom and protection of the users' freedom.
	    </para>
	    <para condition="long">
            In both cases, determining if a license is in accordance with the definition represents a lot of work and requires legal competences as well as an understanding of the philosophy of the movements. For that reason these two lists are a very important reference.

	  <question>
	    <para>
	      What is a non-free (or proprietary) license ?
	    </para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>
              A <quote>non-free</quote> license is a license which requires a transaction with the holder of the license in order to gain any right related to the software.
	    </para>
	    <para>
              First of which is the right to use it, often conditioned by the payment of an amount of money. These licenses equally forbid the copying, the studying of the software's functioning, its modification and any arbitrary combination of these possibilities.

For example Windows Microsoft is a software distributed under a non-free license.

	      Is having a GNU/Linux support useful ?

	      It will generate sells.
	    </para>
	    <para>
              The market is sizeable, and its potential is huge. GNU/Linux is the only operating system presently gaining market shares over all its competitors. It is favored by many computer specialists, who are prescriptors for harware choices. It is now commercially and financially backed by the biggest manufacturers (SUN, IBM, HP, SGI, DELL, etc.). Some goverments are studying the use of &LL; as a standard for their administration (France, Poland, Argentina, China, ...)

	  <question id="dualDrivers">
	    <para>
	      My customers are asking for Linux drivers, what can I do ?
	    </para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>
	      Possible choices are :
	      <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    Announce there is no support for your hardware
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    Develop drivers and release them in a binary form (without giving away the sources)
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    Publish your hardware interface specifications, thus letting third parties write and distribute drivers on their own.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    Develop drivers under an Open Source or Free Sofware license.
		  </para>
		  <para>
                    This approach insures fast availability of the drivers. It also permits to share with third parties (companies or individuals) the effort of maintainance, debug, documention and portage. In this model, choosing a license which guarantees that the improvements of the drivers will be distributed according to the same terms is crucial for the company In this way no competitor can appropriate the modifications it finances.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para id="dualDrivers.text">
		    Publish <quote>mixed</quote> drivers
		  </para>
		  <para>
		    It consists in publishing a part of the drivers according to the previous logic, and supplying the rest of the drivers under a binary form and non-free license (see the second alternative).
		  </para>
		  <para condition="long">
                   It allows access to basic features as well as realization of an interface with the operating system, thanks to a &LL; adaptable to evolutions of the system. Certain <quote>advanced</quote> features remain hidden in exclusive, fixed modules which do not need to evolve with the rest of the system. It can provide a satisfactory solution in cases where part of the product originates from a third-party supplier and is under a non-free license. It is a choice notably made by certain graphic board manufacturers.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
                    Publicly spread the specifications AND develop the drivers, then distribute them under a free license.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		    This is an ideal solution for the customer. It is also a very good configuration for the manufacturer, except in some particular cases (see <quote><xref endterm="nonOS.text" linkend="nonOS"/></quote>).

	    <para>
	      Can I hope a third party will spontaneously develop the drivers ?
            </para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>
              Yes, by giving away the specifications for your products and making the announcement. Volunteers (companies or individuals) can then take care of developments.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      But this approach has some drawbacks :
	      <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    The numbers of developers will partly rely on luck.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    Volunteers work at their own pace.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		   Therefore, the drivers may not be available in time for important dates (convention, commercial release, ...).

		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
                    No sale can be expected before the drivers are available.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    No control is exercised on the quality of resulting software.

	    <para>
	      Yes. By developing and releasing binary drivers.
	    </para>

              As opposed to other operating systems, GNU/Linux executes on a large number of hardware platforms. It is difficult to test them all without the assistance of a community.
              Furthermore, versions of the Linux kernel are released on a more steady rythm than those of the other operating systems.

	    <para condition="long">
              GNU/Linux is not the only free operating system. If the others can seem unimportant in market shares, they exist nevertheless, and their users wish to dispose of the necessary resources for proper operating of their machines.

              Finally, as explained by the founder of the &OS; movement Eric S. Raymond, in his article <ulink url="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings">The Magic Cauldron</ulink> :
              <quote>Today, the time your competitors' engineers would need to spend copying and understanding the copy is a substantial portion of the product cycle, time they are not spending innovating or differentiating their own product. Plagiarism is a trap you want your competitors to fall into.</quote>.

              Software drivers production made by electronic manufacturers is a recent phenomenon. Previously the manufacturers spread Hardware Interface Specifications, letting the responsibility of developing drivers for operating systems in the hands of their editors and/or of the users.
	    </para>
	    <para condition="long">
             This policy was not satisfactory because it implied that the drivers for the same material could be developed several times by various customers, which is technically and commercially ineffective. It is thus under the pressure of their customers that the manufacturers financed the development of the drivers.
             However this new system showed another flaw : it favored the appeareance of monopolies which then exercised an unbearable pressure on customers and suppliers as well.

	    <para condition="long">
              Today, as Internet eases the broadcasting of projects and free licenses bring guarantees on their accessibility and their evolution, the involvement of the manufacturers doesn't need to be as important.

	      Which license to choose for distributing my drivers ?
	   </para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>
              Many software licenses already exist. You can use them for the distribution of your drivers (see also <quote><xref endterm="libreLicense.text" linkend="libreLicense"/></quote>).
	    </para>
	    <para>
              It is a rare case when a company feels the need to engage in the redaction of a new free license. Creating and maintaining a license is generally a waste of time. Furthermore, it complicates the task of companies and individuals who decide to work on your drivers.
	    </para>
	    <para condition="long">
The most famous licenses are the GNU General Public License (GPL), the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), the modified BSD licenses and the Mozilla Public License (MPL).
	    </para>
	    <para condition="long">
              As a rule of thumb, the GPL will always be preferred when nothing opposes it. If external constraints make this choice impossible, the best is to contact a specialized structure to expose your case (see also <quote><xref endterm="contact.text" linkend="contact"/></quote>). Factors determining the choice of a license are numerous and have important consequences, to discuss it is the best way to find a well fitted solution.

	    <para>
	      What policies have other manufacturers adopted ?
	    </para>
	  </question>
	  <answer>
	    <para>
	      ATI, Creative, Epson, HP, IBM, Intel, Kodak, Matrox 
	      (amongst others)
	      publish hardware specification for a vast majority of their products.

              These manufacturers are also involved in the development of the drivers for their hardware (fully or partially).

              Finally, they distribute their drivers under a free license (fully or partially), see also <quote>
		<xref endterm="dualDrivers.text" linkend="dualDrivers"/>
	      </quote>).

              This position insures them a maximal coverage of the market, while assuring the best possible support for their products.
	    </para>
	    <para>
              The following manufacturers supply only binary versions (under non-free license) of their drivers, but for a large number of operating systems, including GNU/Linux: Lexmark, NVidia, Olitec.

              These manufacturers satisfy a large number of consumers. But by dismissing the help the &LL; and &OS; community of developers could supply, they endure a more important effort to keep their drivers up to date with the new versions of operating systems.
	    </para>
	    <para>
              An inherent problem of the binary drivers is their lack of <quote>modularity</quote>. Being usually modules for the kernel, they can, if they are badly conceived, cause the failure of a whole machine. So editors of free software distributions hesitate to put modules which risk entailling a big load for their support services. An emblematic example are the NVIDIA modules for GNU/Linux, which, in spite of their recognized performances, are not included in the <ulink url="http://www.linux-mandrake.com">Mandrake 8.0</ulink> distribution. As a conclusion, with such an approach, the manufacturers may feel their work is wasted.
	    </para>
	    <para>
              The following companies supply drivers only for a limited number of operating system: Guillemot, Hercule, Canon. These manufacturers limit their market and tarnish their image.

    <para>
    A manufacturer has a strong interest in using free licenses for the developments of his drivers, <emphasis>whatever the target operating system</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      He also should develop drivers himself, or at least their initial version because of :
