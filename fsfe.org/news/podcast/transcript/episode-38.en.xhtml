00:00.000 --&gt; 00:26.000
All right. You ready? Yes. Perfect. Then let's dive into this. Hello and welcome to the Software Freedom Podcast.

00:26.000 --&gt; 00:32.000
This podcast is presented to you by the Free Software Foundation Europe. We are a charity that

00:32.000 --&gt; 00:38.480
empowers users to take control of technology. I am Bonnie Mehring and I am here with my colleague Alex

00:38.480 --&gt; 00:47.520
today. Hello Bonnie. Nice to be here again. Nice to have you. So we have done this several times now.

00:47.520 --&gt; 00:53.440
You want to tell us what the topic is today? Yes, we want to talk about Free Software stacks in Europe.

00:53.440 --&gt; 01:06.400
You forgot a Free Software software stacks. Indeed. Okay. I am sorry. Not, just Free Software stacks. Yes.

01:07.600 --&gt; 01:17.520
That's how we would call them the whole episode. That will be fun. Yes. Okay. But before we dive

01:17.520 --&gt; 01:25.120
into this whole debate surrounding the Free Software software stacks, I would love for us to cover

01:25.120 --&gt; 01:31.280
a bit of the framework and the background around them. Can you give us some idea what we are talking

01:31.280 --&gt; 01:38.560
about when we are mentioning the word Free Software software stacks? Sure. So a couple of years ago,

01:38.560 --&gt; 01:46.000
a debate about digital sovereignty started. And this digital sovereignty debate also came with some

01:46.000 --&gt; 01:52.640
practical solutions, implementations, and one of those are software stacks. So all our administrations

01:52.640 --&gt; 02:01.680
across Europe do need, let's say, core infrastructure and also on the other hand, software stacks that

02:01.680 --&gt; 02:08.800
help them to follow their administrative tasks. So an office solution. And those kinds of office

02:08.800 --&gt; 02:17.680
solutions are part of such a so-called software stack. So it comes with several solutions. You

02:17.680 --&gt; 02:23.040
want to have video calls. You want to have a writer. You want to have a calendar and so on.

02:23.760 --&gt; 02:30.160
And all of these solutions need to be like in the upper rebel. They need to be integrated so that you

02:30.160 --&gt; 02:36.720
can from your calendar directly send the email or start a voice call with your colleagues. And this

02:37.440 --&gt; 02:44.240
basically or could be basically such a software stack. And all of these software stacks in

02:44.240 --&gt; 02:50.960
light of digital sovereignty are discussed in member states of the European Union as well as

02:50.960 --&gt; 02:55.520
in the European Union itself by the European Commission as well in the parliament in the institutions.

02:56.480 --&gt; 03:04.880
So and the institutions itself, but also administrations, EU, national, regional, local level,

03:04.880 --&gt; 03:12.960
do need such office solutions. And they want to have digital sovereign solutions. And for this,

03:12.960 --&gt; 03:19.840
we do recommend to use Free Software for obvious reasons. What French Free Software stack?

03:21.200 --&gt; 03:26.880
The example for this, how this could look like as this is already very much implemented,

03:26.880 --&gt; 03:31.280
can you give us some background here as well and maybe make this a bit more practical?

03:31.760 --&gt; 03:38.960
Sure. So again, so the debate about digital sovereignty is not very new. It started with

03:38.960 --&gt; 03:45.520
final lines first term. And there we started to debate this digital sovereignty and also already

03:45.520 --&gt; 03:51.200
at this time, we have seen that there are initiatives in several member states where they started to

03:51.920 --&gt; 03:58.880
develop or procure Free Software solutions, particularly made for administrations to allow them

03:59.520 --&gt; 04:07.440
to work in a sovereign environment. And yeah, basically using their own solutions tailored to

04:07.440 --&gt; 04:14.080
their own needs. And for this, they often used Free Software. And also at the same time,

04:14.080 --&gt; 04:20.000
code repositories emerged. So we have seen, for example, in Italy that they came up as a free

04:20.000 --&gt; 04:27.040
software code repository dedicated for administrations. So we are administrations that came up as a

04:27.040 --&gt; 04:33.360
Free Software solution for a specific need, shared those solutions in such repositories that other

04:33.360 --&gt; 04:39.760
administrations could pick them and also reuse them. Obviously, this needs to be Free Software

04:39.760 --&gt; 04:45.680
since the four freedoms of Free Software to use study, share and improve, allow in the

04:45.680 --&gt; 04:52.320
availability, allow sharing and allow that it could be used in as many workstations. Yeah, one

04:52.400 --&gt; 04:59.200
one, for example. So, but also we have seen initiatives in France, in Germany and in other member

04:59.200 --&gt; 05:06.080
states. However, all of this is mainly piecework. It's not really connected to each other. So Italy

05:06.080 --&gt; 05:11.360
does it, France does it, Germany does it, but they do not really collaborate. So and that's one of

05:11.360 --&gt; 05:17.920
the main issues we see that there are initiatives in member states that are quite okay, let's say it,

05:18.560 --&gt; 05:23.840
but the thing is that they, yeah, they basically in their silo, they work on their own,

05:24.640 --&gt; 05:31.600
and for this they are also practical reasons. The very first one is a language thing, but in general,

05:31.600 --&gt; 05:38.640
I'd say a writer, if translated, could be used by every administration, right? So the needs

05:38.640 --&gt; 05:44.640
and the back end is basically always the same. It's just about like making the front and

05:44.640 --&gt; 05:52.160
the translated end to the language. Exactly, and also like it's also about design, so you want to

05:52.160 --&gt; 05:57.280
change logos and stuff like this, right? So, but in general, the solution is always the same.

05:57.920 --&gt; 06:03.520
So, and this is basically where we are. So in Germany, for example, the Center for Digital

06:03.520 --&gt; 06:09.360
Sovereignty (ZenDiS), this is basically a company founded by the government itself, started to come up as

06:09.840 --&gt; 06:14.640
office solution, which is called OpenDesk. We see similar approaches in France,

06:15.600 --&gt; 06:22.240
last week is a call over there, and yeah, and as said, we see piece work here and there and every

06:22.240 --&gt; 06:28.240
member state. We see in particular discussions in every member state, and these discussions have

06:28.240 --&gt; 06:37.040
been speed up since the Trump administration and for obvious reasons. However, it often remains on

06:37.040 --&gt; 06:45.520
such a discussion level, and also in particular, the collaboration cross-border remains more of an

06:45.520 --&gt; 06:53.280
idea instead of like a practical approach at this stage. So, and here a debate, I'd say, one

06:53.280 --&gt; 07:00.080
one and a half year ago, started in the U.K. Parliament, where the so-called EuroStack was

07:00.080 --&gt; 07:07.200
debated initiative by Francesca Prier, for example, who came up with this idea to have such

07:07.200 --&gt; 07:13.200
a European approach towards this, right? So, to like, let these member states initiatives

07:13.200 --&gt; 07:20.080
collaborate and to come up with, yeah, obviously, a European stack, which is then available and

07:20.080 --&gt; 07:26.640
usable and also useful for administrations across Europe, no matter if it's a European,

07:26.640 --&gt; 07:32.400
national, regional, local level. And here the question is, how should such a stack look like?

07:33.120 --&gt; 07:39.440
And here we can see that in the beginning of the debate, it was very much attached to the idea

07:39.440 --&gt; 07:43.680
of coming up with a Free Software solution towards this. Since it's obvious, again, the four

07:43.680 --&gt; 07:50.800
freedoms, you study share and improve, allow us that it's very easy and also basically the only

07:50.800 --&gt; 07:57.680
practical approach towards allowing collaboration across border. However, in the last years,

07:57.680 --&gt; 08:04.960
the debate slightly shifted away from the Free Software idea towards more like European

08:04.960 --&gt; 08:11.200
ideas, let's say it, and there was like a slogan which came up just recently by European.

08:11.840 --&gt; 08:18.160
So, and with this idea, it's more going into the direction that digital sovereignty is everything,

08:18.160 --&gt; 08:24.640
but it's coming from Europe. And not that much if it should be Free Software anymore. So, and that's

08:24.640 --&gt; 08:30.800
one of the main issues we see, but also on the other hand, again, that there is not really

08:30.800 --&gt; 08:36.880
collaboration happening. So, we see in some parts, collaboration, for example, France and Germany

08:36.880 --&gt; 08:42.960
try a collaboration with the last wheat and open desk, so these are solutions. And they want to come

08:42.960 --&gt; 08:51.040
up as a right on solution, which is then shared between both steps, so to say, and could be

08:51.040 --&gt; 08:56.400
integrated in open desk as well as in last week. But again, we see here only two member states

08:56.400 --&gt; 09:02.720
collaborating. And we do not really know how this collaboration should further be enlarged. And

09:02.720 --&gt; 09:10.160
also, we do not really see if it's going out of this like bilateral collaboration. And if it's

09:10.160 --&gt; 09:15.440
we are going to more towards the European approach. This is the state of the debate at the moment.

09:16.000 --&gt; 09:23.760
And what we are trying and also like in procurement and funding debates is to work towards the idea

09:23.760 --&gt; 09:31.520
to stimulate and not subsidize and collaborations across Europe so that the European Union should see

09:32.320 --&gt; 09:39.920
and analyze where in Europe we see developments of Free Software solutions and how they could

09:39.920 --&gt; 09:45.840
collaborate with others doing something similar or who have similar needs at the same time,

09:46.480 --&gt; 09:53.360
bringing them together and making them collaborate. Because this is the advantage of Free Software

09:53.360 --&gt; 09:58.320
that we can collaborate, that we can share resources. And by that, not only come up with the best

09:58.320 --&gt; 10:03.760
solution, but also like particularly on the mid and long run, this is how we can save money.

10:03.760 --&gt; 10:09.600
And this is also how we can be ultimately digital sovereign, right? When we have our own free

10:09.600 --&gt; 10:16.080
software solution, which we can adapt at any time, which we can make it available to every

10:16.080 --&gt; 10:22.480
administration. And by that, we have the control over our own technology or administrations have

10:22.480 --&gt; 10:29.520
the control over their own technology and are able to like change it and adapt it to the specific

10:29.520 --&gt; 10:35.680
needs. So, and this is basically what we want to try to advocate for at the moment. The

10:35.760 --&gt; 10:42.000
this collaboration is stimulated by the European Union and also that member states initiatives are

10:42.000 --&gt; 10:47.680
not being closed down since we have a European solution for this. No, we want these initiatives

10:47.680 --&gt; 10:53.760
in member states, but we want them to collaborate with others in order to have an indoor operable,

10:54.480 --&gt; 11:01.280
European software stack. And that would be our idea of such a Free Software,

11:01.920 --&gt; 11:08.880
software stack on the European level. I was so happy that you mentioned the word Free Software,

11:08.880 --&gt; 11:18.240
software stack. Anyway, okay. So, you mentioned several arguments. Basically, it all comes down

11:18.240 --&gt; 11:28.080
to that we are asking or demanding an coordinated effort. So, I do believe the coordination

11:28.080 --&gt; 11:35.600
should be stimulated. So, it's not that we should start this, I don't know, an approach,

11:35.600 --&gt; 11:41.280
where we say the next five years, we do this and this and this and this. It should still remain

11:41.280 --&gt; 11:48.880
flexible. Also, member states should be able to do whatever they need at the moment. However,

11:49.600 --&gt; 11:56.400
the core idea always must be that it's an indoor operable and that they at least know what's

11:56.400 --&gt; 12:01.520
happening in other member states and that they try to collaborate whenever there is a need to

12:01.520 --&gt; 12:08.160
collaborate. So, let's assume Germany and Italy are working on the same thing. Let's say a video

12:08.160 --&gt; 12:13.200
conferencing tool at the moment and then the European Union knows about this and goes there and say,

12:13.200 --&gt; 12:18.000
look, Italy, Germany, you are both working on the same thing. Don't you want to collaborate?

12:18.000 --&gt; 12:23.360
So, why do you want to come up with two solutions that are different? Let's collaborate here.

12:23.920 --&gt; 12:29.840
Like, if there are good reasons, for example, for Italy and France to say, on this, we

12:30.640 --&gt; 12:37.200
don't want to collaborate that there's no force to do so. That's the one thing, but also,

12:37.200 --&gt; 12:43.280
let's use the example of Jitsi and Big Blue Button. So, we want that Jitsi and Big Blue Button

12:43.280 --&gt; 12:48.320
are out there for administrations and then administration can pick whatever they do believe is

12:48.320 --&gt; 12:53.520
the best solution for them. However, it is important that both video conferencing solutions work

12:53.520 --&gt; 13:00.640
together. So, there is a possibility for the ones using Big Blue Button also being able to

13:00.640 --&gt; 13:06.640
communicate with the ones using Jitsi without any major issues, right? So, it should be easy

13:07.280 --&gt; 13:12.720
to collaborate cross-border with other administrations even if they use other Free Software solutions.

13:12.720 --&gt; 13:18.080
So, it's not, and this is, I think the core idea here, it's not about this one stack so that

13:18.080 --&gt; 13:24.720
everyone uses this one and only solution. It's more about that we integrate all the existing

13:24.720 --&gt; 13:30.640
solutions out there and making them in the upper level that both of them can communicate.

13:30.640 --&gt; 13:37.280
And for this, we need open standards, we need open APIs, and ultimately Free Software in order to

13:37.360 --&gt; 13:43.600
allow this collaboration. And this is what I mean, it's like stimulating it and making it happen

13:43.600 --&gt; 13:50.640
that this cross-border collaboration could happen. And this means, let's say, Germany and France

13:50.640 --&gt; 13:55.040
are working with the Jitsi solution Italy and Spain are working with Big Blue Button.

13:55.600 --&gt; 14:00.000
Those two countries should come up with their Big Blue Button or Jitsi solution.

14:00.000 --&gt; 14:04.800
And then the union should step in and make sure that both of these solutions can talk to each other.

14:04.800 --&gt; 14:17.040
Now, I think I understood the thing or the frame. Let's say the idea. Now, I understood the idea.

14:17.040 --&gt; 14:22.640
You have to be behind this argument of collaboration and stimulating collaboration.

14:23.360 --&gt; 14:29.280
So, it's more about that there's still a wide choice, but that we can actually still work

14:29.360 --&gt; 14:36.000
together and have the interoperability. Exactly. So, we don't procure this one European stack for

14:36.000 --&gt; 14:45.520
every administration across all over Europe. We still allow national or regional or local ideas

14:45.520 --&gt; 14:52.160
and also like depending on their needs, whatever they need. So, they should have, ultimately,

14:52.160 --&gt; 14:58.080
every administration should have software tailored to their needs. However, this software still needs

14:58.080 --&gt; 15:05.360
to be interoperable with other solutions of other administrations that have another focus,

15:05.360 --&gt; 15:10.320
let's say. So, and for this, it's very important to not say like this is the one and only

15:10.320 --&gt; 15:18.800
solution for everyone, but we want to have several solutions being able to compete, to be innovative

15:19.360 --&gt; 15:25.920
and to allow also like further development. And then administrations can say, I am going to

15:25.920 --&gt; 15:30.480
migrate my system now over to a GT because I've seen this is working way better for me.

15:31.200 --&gt; 15:36.480
And this should be easy so they should be able to go to a code repository, for example,

15:36.480 --&gt; 15:41.200
and say, let's integrate this and remove the big to button or the other way around.

15:41.200 --&gt; 15:46.480
Or they say, I am totally happy with my big to button. However, I acknowledge that the people

15:46.480 --&gt; 15:51.280
over there are using GT because they started the development, I don't know, five years ago.

15:51.360 --&gt; 15:56.240
Why should they now switch everything? So, for this, they need to be interoperable. So,

15:56.240 --&gt; 16:05.200
it needs to be able for them to still communicate via several software solutions. And this should

16:05.200 --&gt; 16:13.280
be all part of the stack. So, now we talked about a bit about the arguments that VZ and the points

16:13.360 --&gt; 16:21.760
that we demand or give voice to. How is this received and what's the current, how do you think

16:21.760 --&gt; 16:26.960
it's going? Because we already talked about the current debate surrounding all of this by European

16:26.960 --&gt; 16:33.040
dimension and all of this. Let's bring this together. Where are we heading Alex?

16:33.920 --&gt; 16:38.720
So, and that's yeah, that's basically one of the issues I see at the moment. So, while it was like,

16:38.800 --&gt; 16:46.080
let's say a couple of years ago, the idea to have such a European solution was very received.

16:46.080 --&gt; 16:51.600
People understood why there is a need for this. But this also at the same time led to national

16:51.600 --&gt; 16:56.800
debates. And we can see this very clearly in Germany at the moment where they want to come

16:56.800 --&gt; 17:04.480
up with a German stack. So, and here I fear that we end up in silos instead of like collaborating.

17:05.200 --&gt; 17:12.000
So, I said it's a good idea if every member state has their own approach to things. However,

17:12.960 --&gt; 17:19.200
again, if someone is working on such a stack, let's say France and Germany need a writer,

17:19.200 --&gt; 17:25.920
so why shouldn't they collaborate on this? So, and the more we go towards this, the more we can

17:25.920 --&gt; 17:31.280
collaborate, the more we can have shared procurement, even cross-border shared procurement,

17:31.280 --&gt; 17:37.440
and by thus we can build on the benefits of Free Software and, for example, save money on the

17:37.440 --&gt; 17:48.000
mid and long run. But if we now go and say, we come up with 27, sorry, if we now start to come

17:48.000 --&gt; 17:54.080
up with a own software stack in each member state, then it's very more difficult to achieve this

17:54.080 --&gt; 17:59.680
collaboration, to achieve this interoperability, because then everyone is going back to the silo,

18:00.560 --&gt; 18:06.240
working on their own, saying like, now we have this shiny national stack, but how is this

18:06.240 --&gt; 18:12.000
interoperability with others? Why didn't you collaborate on the procurement or development of

18:12.000 --&gt; 18:18.560
bits of these stacks where you see like other member states have similar needs at the moment?

18:18.560 --&gt; 18:24.800
And this is what I fear at the moment, so this is shifting away from like this European idea,

18:24.800 --&gt; 18:31.440
this European software stack, which is coming with several solutions. However, this could end up in,

18:31.440 --&gt; 18:37.760
yeah, national software stacks that are maybe nice to have for this member state,

18:38.400 --&gt; 18:44.480
but not too nice for like a European approach towards this, also the Buy European debate.

18:44.480 --&gt; 18:50.640
So decision makers more and more want to be independent from in particular US tech,

18:50.720 --&gt; 18:57.440
which is reasonable, and which is also good idea, I do believe. However, if we then just switch

18:57.440 --&gt; 19:04.720
the vendor lock in from US to European union companies, that won't help us. So the simple idea of

19:04.720 --&gt; 19:10.560
buying European doesn't mean that it's interoperable, but doesn't mean that it is Free Software.

19:10.560 --&gt; 19:16.240
So and this is something which we see in the debate that there is a shift from a way of this

19:16.240 --&gt; 19:23.120
Free Software thing towards a general by European idea. So and this by European doesn't mean that

19:23.120 --&gt; 19:27.680
there is collaboration, it just means pick something from European company. And there are also

19:27.680 --&gt; 19:34.480
European companies that do not really value the idea of Free Software, for example. So this means

19:34.480 --&gt; 19:40.400
you can easily end up in another vendor lock in, which is a European vendor lock in,

19:40.480 --&gt; 19:46.400
which won't help you in the mid and long run. It might help with some problems, for example,

19:46.400 --&gt; 19:52.720
that it's hosted in the European union, which is a good idea, but however, it's not coming with

19:52.720 --&gt; 19:59.280
four freedoms to use that to share and improve. But just this idea of like whatever comes from

19:59.280 --&gt; 20:05.520
Europe is at the same time so right. And this is not the case. And this is something which we try to

20:05.520 --&gt; 20:12.400
counter in the debate saying first Free Software as something global. Second, you do not want to run

20:12.400 --&gt; 20:19.040
in a European vendor lock in. And for this, ultimately, you always have to say it needs to be free

20:19.040 --&gt; 20:25.680
software. So best case is you buy Free Software in Europe. However, if the Free Software is coming

20:25.680 --&gt; 20:33.520
from somewhere else, also fun. As there are the four freedoms and they guarantee the access to the

20:34.080 --&gt; 20:40.320
software. Precisely. And also here we need to say we need to enlarge our capacities step by step.

20:40.320 --&gt; 20:46.000
So it's also not that we have millions of companies in Europe that have competitive solutions.

20:46.000 --&gt; 20:51.360
We have to stimulate that market in order to come up with Free Software companies in Europe.

20:51.360 --&gt; 20:56.960
That can provide such solutions. And for this, we need to invest in Dutch companies and not

20:56.960 --&gt; 21:02.560
in random European companies that bring you basically in another vendor lock.

21:05.360 --&gt; 21:12.480
Do you have the feeling that those arguments are paid attention to or what do you think it's happening

21:12.480 --&gt; 21:21.680
here? So this is it's very hard to say. I see that there are more and more arguments and more

21:22.160 --&gt; 21:29.920
decision makers shifting away from the, let's say, openness towards the u-p-ness of something.

21:29.920 --&gt; 21:35.680
So it's a slight shift at the moment. It's not that there is a majority for this already.

21:36.240 --&gt; 21:41.600
At the same time, there's also not a majority for the Free Software idea. So this is our fight.

21:41.600 --&gt; 21:46.240
We will definitely have this fight in the upcoming procurement reform. We also have this

21:46.240 --&gt; 21:52.640
find around precisely those stacks. And also here, maybe this is a very interesting point.

21:53.360 --&gt; 22:01.520
I think a couple of weeks ago, we discussed the NGI funding case where the funding for

22:01.520 --&gt; 22:08.160
Free Software was removed to benefit AI. And this is also such a shift. However, here in the

22:08.160 --&gt; 22:13.760
European Commission, they say we don't want to support Pittsburgh, but rather contribute to such a

22:13.840 --&gt; 22:19.840
stack. So and then at the same time, we see that they are shifting money away from Free Software

22:19.840 --&gt; 22:28.160
towards AI. So this is not to another thing that we often see mass births driving such debates

22:28.160 --&gt; 22:34.560
from quite a while. So we have the bio-pinsing, we have everything needs to be AI. And by

22:34.560 --&gt; 22:40.480
thus Free Software is pushed more and more out of the debate. So and this is something which we

22:40.480 --&gt; 22:48.400
need to counter. And this is also why we whenever we talk about the stacks tell everyone it needs to be

22:48.400 --&gt; 22:54.240
Free Software to end up in this one to basically one. So if you if you go to decision makers and talk

22:54.240 --&gt; 23:00.320
to them what they basically want, they talk about Free Software. So they don't name it Free Software,

23:00.320 --&gt; 23:04.880
but basically they want to have it in the upper levels. They want to have a server and solution

23:04.880 --&gt; 23:10.320
and so on and so forth. However, they are more and more shifting away from the Free Software

23:10.320 --&gt; 23:16.160
wording in this debate going towards other direction. And this could then ultimately mean if it's

23:16.160 --&gt; 23:22.960
text that you then if you in administration that wants to procure something is ending up with something

23:22.960 --&gt; 23:28.240
which is not Free Software, but coming from Europe and by thus it's all fine and they proceed.

23:28.800 --&gt; 23:34.480
So here we need to be very close in the debate and make sure that these criteria

23:35.040 --&gt; 23:40.320
at least always end up in a Free Software solution. So that it's not possible to procure

23:40.320 --&gt; 23:46.320
something else, but that you need to procure or develop Free Software in order to come up as such

23:46.320 --&gt; 23:52.960
as a rune solution. So we debate around the terms of Renate but it ultimately needs. And here we

23:52.960 --&gt; 23:58.560
try to make sure that it's always connected to for freedoms and that's that the procurement always

23:58.560 --&gt; 24:02.800
ends up in a Free Software solution. This will be a hard debate. I mean there are also players on the

24:02.800 --&gt; 24:09.680
other side who have other ideas. In particular, we see that decision makers that are

24:11.040 --&gt; 24:19.760
I'd say more familiar with the digital topics, more eager to understand our arguments.

24:20.400 --&gt; 24:25.040
However, it's also debated on high level at the moment, right? So as said,

24:25.040 --&gt; 24:29.280
also our final line commission president debates this in member states president,

24:30.080 --&gt; 24:35.200
president and chancellor's debate about sovereignty. And here we have seen in the in the

24:35.200 --&gt; 24:42.640
recent years we have seen shifts and these are coming basically from other lobbyists removing

24:42.640 --&gt; 24:49.760
those Free Software words, bringing in more loopholes in order to allow procurement of other non

24:49.760 --&gt; 24:55.520
Free Software solutions. And this is basically a problem and this will be a strong fight which we

24:55.600 --&gt; 25:03.360
will take I guess for the next years. This is a short break for our own cause. Thank you for

25:03.360 --&gt; 25:09.040
listening to the software freedom podcast, working for software freedom and producing podcasts

25:09.040 --&gt; 25:16.240
costs money. Please consider supporting us with a donation on the fsfe.org slash donate and

25:16.240 --&gt; 25:24.160
then the show notes. This will be a strong fight which we will take I guess for the next years

25:24.160 --&gt; 25:30.640
and this is where we are also very close to like the developments of sorts such stacks so we

25:30.640 --&gt; 25:36.400
closely follow what's happening in Germany for example or in France or in Italy to see

25:36.400 --&gt; 25:41.440
what the ultimately come up with. And at the moment we have seen that they found a practical

25:41.520 --&gt; 25:47.120
approach towards this. So they connected pretty much to their code repositories. So they say

25:48.400 --&gt; 25:54.720
it needs to be procured and needs to be ultimately in the code repository available. And those

25:54.720 --&gt; 26:02.560
code repositories then say look you can only bring in your solution if it's one of these licenses

26:02.560 --&gt; 26:08.720
for example and all of them are Free Software licenses. So but what happens if those rules of

26:08.800 --&gt; 26:14.320
these code repositories are changed. So it's a smart idea in the first place but it could also

26:14.320 --&gt; 26:22.160
easily end up in oh now we see that there's a solution it's not fully Free Software but how do we

26:22.160 --&gt; 26:27.520
print this in the code repository are we change the rules of the code repository. So if you attach

26:28.560 --&gt; 26:35.440
software only to the code repository without coming up with further criteria then you might end up

26:35.440 --&gt; 26:42.320
in a world where those code repositories might in the future also allow other non-Free Software

26:43.040 --&gt; 26:48.000
in these repositories and that would be a problem. So and this is the level of detailed

26:48.000 --&gt; 26:54.640
fight we are picking at the moment. So there are smart ideas to close loop holes but we also have

26:54.640 --&gt; 26:59.920
to think about the future and make sure that those loop holes are closed forever. So and these are

26:59.920 --&gt; 27:05.280
the debates we are running at the moment. So it's a lot of needy-queasy. We type over words we

27:05.280 --&gt; 27:12.640
fight over ideas and trying to again go to decision makers and make them understand that Free Software

27:12.640 --&gt; 27:20.960
is the only way how to come up is basically what they want. So this sounds like a lot of work to

27:20.960 --&gt; 27:26.880
be honest to follow up and to safeguard Free Software. I mean that's the basic argument you

27:26.880 --&gt; 27:32.560
brought forward is that we want to safeguard Free Software in all of those Free Software

27:32.560 --&gt; 27:39.200
software stacks and make sure that the loop holes are closed and not celebrating small steps but

27:39.200 --&gt; 27:45.840
being those who say stop. There is a potential weakness and we really need to pay attention

27:45.840 --&gt; 27:51.760
to this and as you already said there are several debates and several member states going on.

27:52.400 --&gt; 28:01.520
So well have fun Alex. Yeah yeah I do have. In this regard this is also a call to our listeners.

28:02.000 --&gt; 28:08.080
If you see stack debates ongoing in your member states where you say here are upcoming loop holes

28:08.720 --&gt; 28:15.040
please share them with us so that we can address them. So for us it's not too easy to follow

28:15.040 --&gt; 28:20.720
like every minus step in every member state we try to do so but for this we always need the help

28:20.720 --&gt; 28:26.000
of you guys and also our volunteers and for this please whenever you see something like this

28:26.080 --&gt; 28:33.280
please share this with us. So because this helps us to address those issues and to also like yeah

28:33.280 --&gt; 28:38.480
try to to modify those attempts. Also at the same time what we are doing is to look for best

28:38.480 --&gt; 28:45.760
practices. So if you see a very good idea in your member state how a loop hole is addressed and fixed

28:45.760 --&gt; 28:50.400
this is also something which is of high importance for us because then we can use this as a

28:50.720 --&gt; 28:56.160
best practice for other member states and tell them look this could be a solution how you can fix

28:56.160 --&gt; 29:03.600
this loop hole in your strategy in your law and make sure that you ultimately do come up as a free

29:03.600 --&gt; 29:13.520
software software. I also have a call for action in this regard as it nicely fits in with our

29:13.520 --&gt; 29:19.360
public money public code campaign. If you have not signed our open letter there please feel free

29:19.360 --&gt; 29:25.120
to do so you find the link in the show notes. Alex you want to talk about why it fits in with

29:25.120 --&gt; 29:30.640
public money public code. Sure I mean it's obvious it's with our public money public code initiative

29:30.640 --&gt; 29:38.320
we try to convince decision makers, administrations across Europe to come up with rules and in particular

29:38.320 --&gt; 29:45.040
also implement those rules that whenever taxpayers money is used the solution should be available

29:45.120 --&gt; 29:53.760
for everyone and for us obviously again Free Software is the way to go and this initiative is

29:53.760 --&gt; 30:01.840
very successful we even see references in laws and strategies towards this and I think it's also a

30:01.840 --&gt; 30:09.520
good idea to follow these principles of public money public code in order to come up with a digital

30:09.520 --&gt; 30:14.960
sovereign solution which is then not only tailored to your needs but where you have to control

30:14.960 --&gt; 30:22.640
over technology and with this campaign it's an umbrella initiative if you like which is used to go

30:22.640 --&gt; 30:30.480
in several different than precise debates around the stack but also about procurement funding

30:30.480 --&gt; 30:36.640
even in the cyber resilience act we are using those kinds of arguments so and this initiative helps

30:37.280 --&gt; 30:43.360
to first of all make it understandable for decision makers what this concept of Free Software means

30:43.920 --&gt; 30:50.960
what are the benefits and then once they understood this go into the details of specific laws

30:50.960 --&gt; 30:58.240
strategies whatever and try to come as close as possible towards those ideas of public money

30:58.320 --&gt; 31:06.880
public code however we see that there are often rules with loopholes and now it's on us to close those

31:06.880 --&gt; 31:16.080
loopholes so often it sets Free Software should be procured if there are not I don't know security

31:16.080 --&gt; 31:22.000
reasons for example so it's very hard to get away from this wording however what we propose is

31:22.720 --&gt; 31:29.120
if there are such security reasons then they should be explained in writing and should

31:29.120 --&gt; 31:35.680
be checked by another institution if they are valid and also should be it should be possible to

31:35.680 --&gt; 31:42.240
counter those and for this for example we can bring in the court of auditors who check if there is

31:42.240 --&gt; 31:48.160
a really a need to not procure Free Software and this is what I mean this closing those loopholes

31:48.160 --&gt; 31:53.760
so maybe we need to attach other loopholes so that we are going to this Free Software first approach

31:54.400 --&gt; 32:00.880
and then if administrations for whatever reason do not procure or develop Free Software then they

32:00.880 --&gt; 32:07.600
need to explain why they are not doing this and this this paperwork they will also understand step

32:07.600 --&gt; 32:12.160
by step that there are not really those kind of arguments around and going more towards the

32:12.160 --&gt; 32:16.960
direction of public money public code and this is why this campaign is so important and also a

32:16.960 --&gt; 32:23.040
nice benefit for you if you sign it you can also register for email updates and but as we will

32:23.040 --&gt; 32:29.360
keep you updated about our progress and also to push for public money public code across Europe.

32:30.400 --&gt; 32:35.440
Perfect thank you very much I like thank you very much for the time I really hope that we

32:36.000 --&gt; 32:42.560
get loads of best practices but I also know it's very important that we get a report of the

32:42.560 --&gt; 32:48.640
programs and all but yeah maybe we have some very very positive news the next time hopefully

32:49.520 --&gt; 32:57.760
we are working towards it yes you are okay in light of the time I would say we close it thank you

32:57.760 --&gt; 33:02.880
so much for being here thank you so much for taking the time and yeah walking us through the free

33:02.880 --&gt; 33:11.840

34:47.600 --&gt; 34:54.080
of software freedom out there I am dropping by here to encourage you to do the same volunteer your

34:54.080 --&gt; 34:59.840
particular set of skills to the FSFE and help further the course of software freedom along with a great
