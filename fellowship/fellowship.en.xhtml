      <p> 
        <strong>The Fellowship</strong> is the primary way
        people can identify with and support the <strong>Free
          Software Foundation Europe</strong>.  It provides
        <strong>collaborative tools</strong> for supporters to
        describe what they are doing and interact with each
        other. The Fellowship is a society for people who want
        to help the Free Software movement
        <strong>grow</strong>.

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Increase FSFE's financial independence!</strong>
      Supporting freedom can mean having to be straightforward at
      times and that requires financial independence. With your yearly
      contribution, you lay the foundations for incorruptible and
      undeviating work.</li>

      <li><strong>Increase FSFE's political weight!</strong> Supporting freedom
      can mean having to stand up against powerful opponents and that requires
      a strong voice. Your support adds weight to FSFE's message and increases
      its impact on political decision makers. </li>


      <li><strong>Increase FSFE's workforce!</strong> Supporting software
      freedoms all over Europe requires helpers with vital local knowledge. As
      a Fellow, you can become FSFE's eyes, ears and hands wherever you
      live.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Local meetings</h2>

        groups</a> are emerging in more and more European cities. These groups
      allow Fellows from an area to meet and get to know one another. Groups
      undertake activities ranging from a comfortable beer to running public
      awareness <a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/FellowshipEvents">events</a>.
