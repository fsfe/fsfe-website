    <title>SELF</title>
    <description>
     The SELF project (Science, Education and Learning in Freedom) aimed
     at creating a repository of educational materials on Free Software
     and Open Standards. It did this by providing a platform for the
     collaborative development of educational materials, as well as by
     engaging in the development of educational materials that were missing
     in the field today.
