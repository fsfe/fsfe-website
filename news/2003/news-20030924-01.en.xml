    <body>
      <p>
In its plenary vote on the 24th of September, the European Parliament
approved the proposed directive on "patentability of
computer-implemented inventions" with amendments that clearly restate
the non-patentability of programming and business logic, and uphold   
freedom of publication and interoperation.
