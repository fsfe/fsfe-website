<h1>Associate Organisations of the FSFE</h1>

<p>Associate organisations are independent of the Free Software Foundation
Europe and entirely autonomous. They are completely self-run and -managed in
all aspects (such as membership, statutes, finances and so on).</p>

<p>Being associate means being formally allied and having immediate access to
the FSFE. So associates are usually involved in the internal communication and
consideration process. Also we will work together for campaigns and events such
as tradeshows.</p>

<p>As a lot of the regular work is often done by volunteers from associate
organisations, joining one of these organisations is an easy way of becoming
involved in the FSFE's activities.</p>

<p>If you wish to know more about the associate status, you will find that
information <a href="/associates/about.html">here</a>.</p>
