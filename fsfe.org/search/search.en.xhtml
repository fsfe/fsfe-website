  <div id="introduction">
    <p>
      Find news articles and pages about topics your are interested in.
      You can use one or multiple terms.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    The search crawls through all site titles, teasers and tags, but
    not the full article text. You will see maximum 15 results in news 
    and pages. The case of your term does not matter. If you do
    not find what you were looking for, please try a variation of the
    terms, or different words, and use the <a href="#tips">advanced
    search features</a>.
  </p>

  <noscript>
    <p>
      JavaScript needs to be activated for the search functionality to
      work. Usually, we do our best to avoid depending on this. If you do
      not want to activate JavaScript, you can use an external search
      engine which does not require it (for example <a
      href="https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/">DuckDuckGo</a>), and use
      the "site:fsfe.org" modifier in the query.

  <h2 id="tips">Tips for advanced searches</h2>

  <p>
    You can customise your searches to narrow down the results. Here
    are a few examples, you can find more in the <a
    href="https://lunrjs.com/guides/searching.html">documentation of
    the library</a> we use.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Wildcards: <code>communi*</code> will display results for e.g.
      <em>community</em> and <em>communication</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Presence: with <code>+router -patents consultation</code> you
      define that <em>router</em> must be found in the results. All
      results containing <em>patents</em> will be ruled out. The
      presence of <em>consultation</em> is optional.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fields: you can limit your search to the site titles with
      <code>title:router</code>. Other fields are <code>teaser</code>,
      <code>type</code> and <code>tags</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Only news/pages: <code>+standard +type:page</code> only shows
      pages with the word <em>standard</em>. The opposite is the
      <em>news</em> type. Note the + signs to enforce both terms to be
      present.
    </li>
    <li>
      Boosts: you can increase weight of certain terms. With
      <code>router^10 freedom</code> the weight of the first term is
      10x higher.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fuzzy matches: With <code>organisation~1</code>, you will find
      results with <em>organisation</em> and <em>organization</em>. One
      character in the findings can be different from your search term.
    </li>
  </ul>
