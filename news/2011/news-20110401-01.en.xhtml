	<h1>Cutting-edge development: the Analogue Printer</h1>

	<p newsteaser="yes">Today FSFE announced a new cutting-edge development: the Analogue Printer.</p>

	<p>"Usually, FSFE concentrates on Free Software policy issues: we work
	to promote Free Software in politics, business, and law, to increase
	social awareness of Open Standards and acceptance by society at large.
	But at one point we decided to use <a href="/donate/donate.html">our donations</a>
	to develop this groundbreaking device", says FSFE's Fellowship
	Coordinator Matthias Kirschner.
	</p>
	
	<p>
  The device is available in two versions:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Analogue printer, business-style pen, dark blue (€12.00).
      This analogue printer is interoperable and works on every platform.
      Highly hackable, it uses Open Standards and comes with a shiny box.<br/>

    </li>
    <li>
      Analogue printer, geek-style pen, green (€5.00). This analogue
      printer is interoperable and works on every platform. Highly
      hackable, it uses Open Standards.<br/>
      <a href="/order/order.html#other-items"><img src="/order/2010/images/pen-green-small.jpg" /></a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The device can print any colour, 3D, underwater, and all file formats.
    Since the device is analogue, there is no digital restriction
    management (DRM), so you can use it for any purpose.

    "It  was high time to provide users with a device that frees them not
    only from the bonds of proprietary software, but from the limitations
    of software in general", says Karsten Gerloff, FSFE's President. "This
    is a tool that will finally give you 100% direct control over your
    written communications, with no black boxes getting between you and
    your messages."
