<h1>Linqa: a Free Software bilingual collaboration platform developed with public money</h1>

<p>Linqa is a bilingual collaboration platform whose code is Free Software 
and developed using public money. It helps the daily work of the 
Franco-German Forum 
for the Future, a public institution that fosters collaboration among 
actors in France and Germany. We dive into the roots of Linqa with the 
people behind it.</p>

<p>
<em>To learn how Linqa started and how it works we talked with the CEO 
of the organization that commissioned this platform, Lale Eckardt, the 
co-founder of the company that developed it, Juergen Neumann, and Linqa 
Project Lead, Robin Denz.</em>
</p>  

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: First of all, can you explain what is Linqa?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Juergen Neumann (DMX co-founder*): <a href="https://linqa.eu/">Linqa</a> 
is a simple web-based whiteboard application with automatic translation 
between two languages. Editors can create and upload bilingual content, 
e.g. notes or PDFs, and arrange it within workspaces. Each workspace has 
dedicated members, who can discuss and comment on these contents in 
their native language in a chat panel. All content is visible in both 
languages and can be re-edited to manually improve the automatic 
translation.

</div>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: What brought you to develop a platform like Linqa?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Robin Denz (Linqa Project Lead): The development of Linqa was spurred by 
the necessity to enhance collaboration steered by the <a href="https://df-zukunftswerk.eu/">Franco-German 
Forum for the Future</a>. With the aim of strengthening bilateral 
relations and promoting sustainable transformation, we facilitate 
dialogues among local initiatives, public administrators, civil society, 
and academia. In co-creative processes with a wide array of experts, we 
elaborate actionable policy recommendations for both governments. For 
this, we needed a platform that could transcend language barriers and 
streamline our complex work processes. Partnering with DMX to create 
Linqa allowed us to tailor a solution that meets our specific needs.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: Compared to fully proprietary solutions, which is the main benefit of this tool?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Juergen Neumann: Linqa provides an easy-to-use solution to communicate 
and collaborate across language barriers in bilingual teams. While many 
other platforms are cloud-based services that tend to make money out of 
the users’ data, Linqa is Free Software and can be self-hosted. 
The automatic translations in Linqa are currently done using 
DeepL’s EU-based translation service (which is proprietary, ndr).</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: DeepL is proprietary. Do you 
have any plans to change this dependency? Which option do you see to 
address this?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Juergen Neumann: The fact that Linqa depends on DeepL was driven by the 
client's requirements for very accurate automatic translations in 
alignment with data protection requirements, as we found them in their 
public tendering back in 2021. Unfortunately, by that time we did not 
know of any comparable and suitable Free Software based option to 
replace their service. Luckily we can find promising candidates these 
days. We are in the process of evaluating <a 
href="https://github.com/LibreTranslate">LibreTranslate</a> as an 
alternative service.</p>

</figure>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: Why did you decide to develop a platform whose code is Free Software?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Juergen Neumann: Since the founders of DMX Systems 
have been Free Software advocates early on, we have chosen a Free 
Software license from the very beginning. When you start to develop 
code, you immediately understand that writing software is all about 
sharing knowledge. That’s why we think that the resulting code should 
be licensed as Free Software as well. In addition to that, we think 
that Free Software, Open Standards and open interfaces are the only way 
to effectively avoid a vendor lock-in. They can be seen as catalysts to 
encourage people to join efforts. We think this is especially relevant 
for public administrations spending public money. That’s why we always 
try to convince our clients to stay the course and join the Free 
Software environment with their requirements and investments.</p>

<p>The transparency of the code and algorithms allows to investigate 
how the software was made and how it works. The code is no black box: 
improvements by others are not only possible, but explicitly 
welcome.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: What is the main benefit of LInqa being developed as Free Software 
for the Franco-German Forum for the 
Future?
</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Robin Denz: The main benefit of developing Linqa as 
Free Software lies in its potential for widespread adoption and 
adaptation. The Franco-German Forum for the Future has a very specific 
use of the Linqa platform, which follows from our particular 
methodology and the people we work with. We get exactly what we need 
with Linqa but still its potential goes beyond our specific use case. 
So, I am excited and curious to see how other organisations can make 
use of its different functions in other fields than the one of 
Franco-German sustainable governance. For instance, in the humanitarian 
sector. By making the platform Free Software, we empower other 
non-profit actors and organizations to leverage its capabilities for 
their specific domains and requirements. This not only enhances its 
utility beyond our immediate use case but also encourages a community 
of users to contribute improvements and innovations, enriching the 
platform for all users.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: Which role do you think Free Software has in 
developing this kind of projects, commissioned with public money?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Robin Denz: Free Software plays a crucial role in 
projects like Linqa by fostering transparency, accessibility, and 
community-driven innovation. Knowing that a software like Linqa can 
benefit a wide array of other non-profit actors can act as a strong 
legitimization for putting public money in this kind of projects. For 
us, it meant to be able to customize and extend the platform according 
to our evolving needs without being constrained by proprietary 
limitations. Moreover, the ethos of Free Software aligns with our 
mission of promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing across 
borders, ensuring that our tools remain inclusive and adaptable to 
diverse contexts.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: What challenges did you have to face when 
developing Linqa?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Juergen Neumann: The first challenge is about 
licensing: Since there are very many different software licenses, it 
can be difficult to find out if you can actually publish your code - 
including the external libraries – under the terms and conditions of 
your desired license.</p>

<p>The second challenge is about money: Still too few individuals and 
organizations understand the challenges of the Free Software ecosystem. 
To develop and maintain good code, you need skilled people 
who all need to make a living. If individuals and especially 
organizations were willing to spend more money on Free Software instead 
of proprietary software, it would be beneficial to all.</p> 

<p>Also, for us as a company, finding investors often feels much 
harder, because our business model does not include intellectual 
property but is free and open to all.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: What would you say to other companies that are not aware of the benefits of Free Software?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Robin Denz: I would emphasize that choosing Free 
Software for your project not only aligns with principles of openness 
and collaboration but also offers practical advantages. It can foster 
innovation through collective intelligence and enable rapid 
customization to meet specific needs. Moreover, Free Software 
encourages ethical considerations such as data privacy and security, 
which are increasingly critical in today's digital landscape. All in 
all, Free Software helps empowering organizations to build robust, 
community-supported solutions that can benefit society as a whole.</p>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: Some years ago, the FSFE launched the <a href="https://publiccode.eu">“Public 
Money? Public Code!”</a> initiative. With it we ask that software paid 
by taxpayers’ money should be released as Free Software. What is the 
role of Free Software in an organisation like the Franco-German Forum for 
the Future?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Lale Eckardt (Franco-German Forum for the Future CEO): The Franco-German Forum for the 
Future is rooted in the <a 
href="https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/germany/france-and-germany/franco-german-treaty-of-aachen/article/the-treaty-of-aachen-on-franco-german-cooperation-and-integration">Treaty 
of Aachen</a> signed by the two governments 
in 2019. We are thankful that the Federal Ministry of Education and 
Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF), which 
finances our work on the German side, was supportive of an experimental 
approach. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided against jumping to 
conclusions and developing a run-of-the-mill platform just to tick off 
digital engagement. Instead, we took our time trying to understand 
where in our specific work and dialogue process a digital tool can 
offer significant value and how. With Linqa we have a tailored tool 
whose strength lies in its specificity and simplicity. And I think that 
is why Linqa is gathering interest from other organisations as 
well.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: How was the procurement process regarding 
Linqa? Was there a public tender or direct contact with DMX? Was it 
easy to procure Free Software? Do you think is there a way to make it 
simpler to help the procurement of Free Software tools in public 
administration?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Lale Eckardt: Of course, we put the development of 
our platform out to public tender, with DMX submitting the most 
competitive offer. Free Software development was not specified in the 
tender but emerged as an idea through our cooperation with DMX. The 
main challenge for procurement processes of this complexity is finding 
a middle ground between specificity and openness. On the one hand, as 
the contracting authority, we need to be as specific as possible about 
our needs. This ensures fair competition and reliable offers. On the 
other hand, we wanted to remain open to learning from and with the 
service provider, as well as critically assessing our hypotheses 
during the development process. To balance these two aspects, we aimed 
to clearly define the functionalities we envisioned for the platform 
without fixing too many technical details.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>FSFE: What would you say to other public 
administrations that want to develop software? Would you recommend them 
to follow the Public Money? Public Code! principle?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Lale Eckardt: If the money spent on developing 
software from within public administration or in publicly funded 
project like ours can not only make public administration more 
efficient but also, through its availability as Free Software, 
strengthen our digital infrastructure in the public interest, than that 
is good news for our democracies!</p> 
</div>

<p><blockquote>
The <a href="https://publiccode.eu">“Public 
Money? Public Code! (PMPC)”</a> initiative aims 
to establish Free Software as the standard for publicly funded 
software. Promoted by the Free Software Foundation Europe, PMPC is 
supported by over 200 organizations and administrations, and more than 
35.000 individuals. You can also support the campaign signing the <a href="https://publiccode.eu">Open 
Letter</a> and with a <a href="/donate">donation</a> to support this work.
