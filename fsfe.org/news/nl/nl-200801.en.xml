      January has been a month full of activity both on the grassroots community
      level and in broad topics like Free Software legal infrastructure.  The local
      Fellowship groups in Berlin and Duesseldorf are very active, and Duesseldorf's
      Fellowship is planning to expand to nearby cities in the coming months.
      Meanwhile, FSFE and gpl-violations.org have been deepening their partnership
      to ensure fair use of Free Software licences in the European area.
