    <p class="question">
      <strong>2. </strong>
	  In the case of commercial software, the developer itself decides who is authorized to make modifications to the software. This enables monopolies on associated services, and leads to a dependency on the developer. Do you intend to take measures to counter monopolies on these services in the software domain?
    </p>
    
    
    <p class="question">
      <strong>3. </strong>
	  A substantial implementation of open standards in public sectors allows competition between software companies. Do you agree with the definition of the open standards <a href="/freesoftware/standards/def.html">found here</a>? Do you wish to intervene in order to implement them within the public sector, and if so, how would you do so?
    </p>
    
    
    <p class="question">
      <strong>4. </strong>
	  Does your party intend to promote the use and teaching of free software in educational institutions, so as to not offer a 'school of products' featuring only certain software, but the comprehensive education of a technological tool independent any one name or product in particular? If so, how? 
    </p>
    
    
    <p class="question">
      <strong>5. </strong>
	  Many organizations have publicity on their websites for commercial software, for example the PDF reader <a href="/activities/pdfreaders/buglist.html#FR">Adobe Acrobat Reader</a>.<br/> What is your opinion on this form of publicity and what measures do you anticipate taking?
    </p>
    
    
    <p class="question">
      <strong>6. </strong>	  
	  Software programs themselves are protected by the authors' rights in France, though are not, as in literature, subject to patents. However patents for software continue to be granted by patent offices. This form of control is a constraint to open competition, creates confusion among IT companies, and uncertainty regarding the legal aspects. It is therefore impacting upon innovation within the European business community.<br/> What is your position regarding software patents? In what way do you anticipate preventing the risks that the current system presents?
