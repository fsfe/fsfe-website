<p>
In 2024, we continued to promote software freedom through our presence 
at conferences and events across Europe, as well as through our various 
activities and initiatives. Despite our ongoing financial challenges, we 
have actively raised our voice in defence of Device Neutrality and are 
advocating for a dedicated Free Software budget in Europe.

</figure>

<p>After more than 20 years of promoting software freedom, we have 
reached a critical point, having faced significant financial challenges 
in recent years. Our ability to continue our vital work was severely 
compromised, as our work was threatened by a decline in supporters, 
compounded by economic pressures such as rising inflation. For the 
first time, we were forced to send out an urgent appeal via email - a 
heartfelt and unprecedented request for help to our community, emphasising 
that without immediate and substantial support, the FSFE's 
long-standing mission to protect and promote software freedom across 
Europe would be in jeopardy. Fortunately, the response from the 
community was overwhelmingly positive. Many supporters stepped forward 
and helped to stabilise our immediate situation.</p>

<p>Our work is far from complete, and continuous financial support is 
crucial to sustaining our mission. Software freedom is a long-term 
struggle that demands persistent effort, dedication, and resources. The 
importance of this ongoing fight is underscored by recent events, such 
as Apple's litigation with the European Commission to avoid complying 
with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The FSFE is the only non-profit 
that is intervening, with the aim to leverage the voice of the Free 
Software community against the company’s unfair practices. This 
endeavour can take decades and it is a complex, time-consuming, and 
resource-intensive endeavour but we strongly believe that we need to be 
there to defend Device Neutrality and the interests of the Free 
Software community.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the broader landscape for Free Software is facing 
more challenges. Recently, the European Union decided to cut 
its funding to the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, 
highlighting a critical issue: the lack of secure, long-term financial 
support for Free Software. Software freedom requires not only nice 
words but also proper public funding. Free Software is essential for 
ensuring transparency, security, and innovation in the digital age, and 
without steady support, these values are at risk. It's crucial that 
policymakers recognize the importance of Free Software and advocate for 
its continued growth and protection to ensure that technology remains a 
tool for empowerment.</p>

<p>
We have continued initiatives such as the Router Freedom wiki and our 
"Public Money? Public Code!" initiative, where we have started to focus 
more on watchdog activities, monitoring real progress towards Free 
Software in public administrations and speaking out when we see steps in 
the wrong direction. We continued to raise awareness of Free Software 
and its importance for a democratic society through active participation 
in conferences, celebrating the "I Love Free Software" day, and through 
the work of our local groups across Europe.
</p>

<p>In the recent months we have continued focusing also on the younger 
generations. In this regard, the third edition of "Youth Hacking for 
Freedom" (YH4F) is underway, with preparations for the fourth edition 
already in progress. The Ada &amp; Zangemann book is becoming a well-known 
open educational resource, being translated into 10 languages, while 
its readings continue to inspire and educate. Additionally, we are 
working on producing a film about Ada’s story to further amplify its 
impact and reach a broader audience.</p> 

<p>As we navigate these challenges, it is clear that our mission to 
promote software freedom and empower users to control technology 
requires a sustained, long-term support commitment. The recent 
outpouring of community support is a beacon of hope, but the road ahead 
is long and fraught with obstacles. We must continue to advocate for 
the public funding and political support necessary to safeguard the 
Free Software community. By continuing to focus on education and public 
outreach, especially to younger generations, we are laying the 
groundwork for a future where software freedom could thrive.  With your 
continued support, we can continue our work and ensure that we get 
closer to our vision of software freedom for the decades to come.</p>

<blockquote>Our Software Freedom in Europe 2024 report covers the FSFE's activities 
from October 2023 to August 2024. We hope it gives 
you a better understanding of our daily work and that you enjoy reading 
it!</blockquote>

<h2 id="device-neutrality">Device Neutrality: the Free Software community “shows its teeth”</h2>

<p>Device Neutrality empowers users to take control of their devices, 
allowing them to choose how and what software they run, free from 
restrictions imposed by manufacturers or software vendors. This control 
is essential to ensure that users are not locked into a particular 
operating system or forced to use pre-installed applications. Device 
Neutrality promotes innovation, competition and consumer rights by 
preventing monopolistic practices and enabling a diverse software 
landscape.</p>

	alt="Device Neutrality banner "/>
</figure>

<p>Free Software is key for Device Neutrality, and this issue has 
become increasingly important as large technology companies tighten 
their grip on the devices and operating systems they control, raising 
concerns about privacy, digital rights and market dominance. In 2024, 
the FSFE has faced monopolistic power over devices head on. 
Notwithstanding the dangers of giant corporations  over the entire 
digital markets, the FSFE performed key contributions to safeguard 
software freedom: we got involved in <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240812-01.html">strategic litigation against 
Apple</a>, <a href="/news/2024/news-20240627-01.html">coordinated key 
interventions with different civil-society 
stakeholders</a>, and have been closely <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/device-neutrality/202404-FSFE-apple-report-EC.pdf">working 
with the Commission on the 
implementation of the Digital Markets Act</a>. In all these processes, we 
leveraged the voice of the Free Software community, focusing on the 
benefits of smaller Free Software projects for digital markets.
</p>


<h3>Strategic litigation against Apple’s monopolistic control over devices</h3>

<p>The Digital Markets Act (DMA), which came into effect in early 
March, <a href="/news/2024/news-20240307-01.html">introduces significant 
provisions that directly impact Free 
Software</a>. This law requires "gatekeepers" to permit the direct 
installation of software from any source, commonly known as 
(sideloading). Additionally, it mandates that gatekeepers must support 
alternative app stores and repositories, giving users more choices in 
how they access and manage software. The DMA also imposes 
interoperability obligations, ensuring that third-party developers have 
access to the same hardware and software functions as the 
"gatekeepers." These measures collectively aim to enhance competition 
and innovation in the digital marketplace.</p>

<p>Apple was designated as “gatekeeper” in September 2023, but started 
litigation against the Commission in December, 2023. The company has 
pushed an aggressive approach against the DMA, proposing new terms and 
conditions that harm Free Software. In February 2024, the FSFE decided 
to intervene, pairing up with the Commission to protect Free Software 
against Apple’s strike against DMA. In August 2024, the Court of 
Justice of the European Union <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240812-01.html">authorized the FSFE to intervene 
in the 
case</a>. This is a far-reaching case with deep consequences not only for 
Software Freedom, but for fairness of digital markets, open internet 
and digital democracy.</p>

<h3>Implementing the DMA: leveraging the voice of the Free Software community</h3> 

<p>As the Apple’s example demonstrates, abusive gatekeepers’ behaviour 
requires constant monitoring. Implementation of the DMA has been 
technically and legally challenging, as “malicious compliance” from 
gatekeepers has posed real risks to Software Freedom. The FSFE has been 
working with a large spectrum of community actors. For instance, the 
FSFE worked with F-Droid, The App Fair Project and other 
interoperability experts to investigate Apple's DMA compliance and its 
impact on Free Software. During the past months, we coordinated several 
expert workshops with stakeholders, <a href="/news/2024/news-20240318-02.html">discussed with regulators in 
FOSDEM</a>, <a href="/news/nl/nl-202406.html#interoperability-apple">had 
official meetings with the EU Commission's DMA team</a>, and 
submitted a <a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/device-neutrality/202404-FSFE-apple-report-EC.pdf">comprehensive 
position</a> to the European Commission detailing 
several problematic elements in Apple's compliance that will harm Free 
Software. FSFE also submitted a <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240627-01.html">joint position</a> to the 
Commission 
highlighting the main problematic aspects of Apple's behaviour towards 
Free Software. Furthermore, FSFE submitted its feedback to the United 
Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority on the regime guidance, 
<a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/device-neutrality/fsfe-cma-dmcca-07-24.pdf">emphasizing 
the importance of Free Software</a> for fair digital markets, 
as envisioned in the newly enacted Digital Markets, Competition and 
Consumers Act (DMCCA). In collaboration with F-Droid, the FSFE also 
<a 
href="https://download.fsfe.org/device-neutrality/fsfe-apple-report-final.pdf">prepared 
a study for Japan's competition authority</a>, the HDMC, on how 
Apple's compliance with the DMA poses a risk to Free Software and 
Device Neutrality.</p>

<p>We are calling for volunteers and civil society organisations to 
help the message against monopolization of digital markets resonate. We need robust support from policy makers for Free Software, 
so alternatives to gatekeepers can flourish in fair and safe 
environments.</p> 

<p>In addition to this, at the beginning of August we have announced 
that we are intervening in the case of Apple vs Commission to uphold 
the DMA. It is litigation brought by Apple against the European 
Commission in the Court of Justice of the European Union. 
Following the FSFE’s application for intervention, the court recognized 
the FSFE’s interests in the case as a stakeholder and allowed the 
intervention. We will submit our arguments to the court by 
mid-September.</p> 

<h3>Router Freedom: several victories notwithstanding the outbreak from telcos</h3>

<p>Although we should be free to choose the technical devices we use in 
our private lives, some  Internet Service Providers (ISPs) still unduly 
limit how customers connect to the Internet, or 
discriminate against owners of alternative devices. This undermines 
Router Freedom.</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://pics.fsfe.org/uploads/medium/0f/4b/a6f3efd9b4b2abd536eb1ae0c137.png"
	alt="Router Freedom logo" />
</figure>

<p>In the last year, we have accomplished a lot! We participated and 
monitored regulatory processes in Germany, Austria, Italy and Belgium. 
Fiber operators have pushed against Router Freedom, bringing regulators 
to court and asking for regulatory exceptions. The FSFE has coordinated 
efforts with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including volunteers, 
business representatives, digital right groups and consumer protection 
organisations to repel these reactionary initiatives from telcos.</p>

<ul> 
<li><strong>Germany</strong>: Fiber operators requested the 
national regulator BnetzAg to create an exception against Router 
Freedom, asking to take end-users’ freedom over equipment by imposing 
their own fiber terminals. The FSFE intervened in the process, <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20230915-01.html">claiming 
that Router Freedom is key for open internet and net neutrality</a>, so the 
regulator should confirm its own 2016 decision to safeguard Router 
Freedom for all network topologies.</li> 
	
<li><strong>Belgium</strong>: As a decisive victory, the Belgian 
regulator BIPT has introduced <a 
href="/news/2023/news-20231113-02.html">Router Freedom for all types of 
network 
in the country</a>. The FSFE has participated as a key stakeholder in the 
process, contributing to BIPT’s work, presenting the views of the 
community and end-users. Later in 2024, the telecom operator Orange 
has started litigation against the regulator, asking for a exception 
for fiber, claiming the regulator was not diligent in the decision 
making. The court ruled against the operator, confirming the diligent 
work of BIPT in analysing all the benefits of Router Freedom for 
end-users and digital markets, stating all the allegations undue. This 
decision represented a <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240709-01.html">decisive victory for Router 
Freedom</a>, as for the 
first time, a court confirmed a regulatory procedure involving fiber 
networks. The FSFE demanded that other regulators take this as a good 
example.</li>

  conference on "When our routers are not free: the challenges for an 
  Open and Neutral Internet".
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<li><strong>Austria</strong>: Despite the outcry of a broad spectrum 
of stakeholders demonstrating to the Austrian regulator RTR the 
necessity of regulating Router Freedom, the authority dismissed the 
case with no further consideration. The FSFE has been very active in 
the country, <a href="/news/2023/news-20231201-01.html">coordinating efforts with civil-society, industry 
representatives and policy makers</a>, but nonetheless the regulator 
decided to follow the telecom operators’ interests in not attending to
civil-society demands.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Making Router Freedom easier for users: the tech wiki</h3> 

<p>In addition to our policy and legal efforts to conduct a European-wide 
initiative to defend the rights and interests of end-users regarding 
Router Freedom, the FSFE has launched an initiative exclusively 
dedicated to end-users: a practical guide for interested technical people 
desiring to change their router provided by the ISP, helping them on 
the path (sometimes not so trivial) of installing their own private 
router at home. We introduce the new <a 
href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/LocalGroups/BNL">Router Freedom tech 
wiki</a>, prepared 
by our Netherlands team of volunteers!🎉</p>

	alt="Router Freedom decision tree"/>
	<figcaption>The Router Freedom tech wiki helps you with basic information on how to start using your own router</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This wiki helps you to replace the ISP’s router/modem with your own. 
Most modems of the internet service provider allow you to set them in 
'bridge' mode, so you can use your own router for the internal 
networking. Although this allows you to separate your internal 
networking from the ISP, you would end up with two devices where you 
could just have one.</p>

<h3>Device Neutrality website</h3>

<p>This year we launched a new landing page about <a 
href="https://deviceneutrality.org/">Device Neutrality</a> 
to ensure that everyone, regardless of 
their technical background, can grasp the basics of this crucial 
concept. The landing page is designed to explain the essentials in a simple and easy way. By making it simple, we aim to raise awareness 
and foster a broader understanding, helping users recognize the 
importance of supporting and advocating for Device Neutrality in their 
own digital lives.</p>

<p>Also, following the page design, we created a poster with the basics 
which you can order from us to promote Device Neutrality in your 
office, university, or at events.</p>

<h2 id="ngi">Next Generation Internet and the lack of long-term sustainable funding for Free Software</h2>

<p>Although it had proven its success, a couple of months ago we found out that the European 
Commission is <a href="news/2024/news-20240719-01.html">cutting its 
funding</a> in the current draft for the Horizon 
Europe 2025 Work Programme. This decision highlights the larger problem 
of <a href="/news/2024/news-20240808-01.html">the lack of motivated and 
sustainable public funding</a> for Free 
Software projects.</p>

<p>For years, we have been advocating for the need for public funding 
for Free Software, as software freedom guarantees that software remains 
a tool for empowerment, fostering independent development and 
innovation. Through our <a href="https://publiccode.eu/en/">'Public 
Money? Public Code!'</a> initiative, which 
continues to gain support from organizations <a 
href="https://publiccode.eu/en/#action">signing the Open Letter</a>, 
we are raising awareness at conferences, events, and in explaining it 
to politicians.</p> 

<blockquote>'Public Money? Public Code!' demands that software 
developed for the public sector must be made publicly available under a 
Free Software licence. Free Software in public bodies guarantees 
freedom of choice, access, and competition. This allows our public 
administrations to regain full control of their digital infrastructure 
and therefore become and remain independent from a handful of 
companies.</blockquote>

<p>Looking to the future, particularly in light of potential funding 
cuts for Free Software projects under the Next Generation Internet 
(NGI) initiative, it’s clear that <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240911-01.html">sustainable funding for Free 
Software 
must be addressed</a> at the European level. Establishing a long-term 
funding scheme is crucial. In the coming years, our policy efforts will 
focus on raising this issue across Europe, ensuring that fragmented, 
limited, and uncoordinated funding for Free Software becomes a thing of 
the past.</p>

<p>The recent cut of €27 million from the NGI initiative has exposed 
the vulnerability of financial support for software freedom, 
highlighting a critical problem: <strong>Europe needs sustainable, secure, and 
dedicated funding to maintain control over its technology through Free 
Software</strong>. Much of Europe's digital infrastructure depends on these 
projects to ensure technological independence and resilience. Reducing 
or cutting this funding endangers Europe’s autonomy in the digital 
realm. In response to the European Commission’s ambiguous stance on 
future funding, the FSFE has participated in the latest public 
consultation, advocating for the long-term financial backing Free 
Software solutions need to drive Europe’s digital transformation.</p>

<p>Since November 2018, the FSFE has been a partner organisation of 
<a href="https://ngi.eu/">Next Generation Internet Zero (NGI0)</a>, which is a coalition of 
non-profit organizations from all over Europe coordinated by the NLnet 
Foundation. Coming under the overall NGI umbrella, the purpose of NGI0 
is to provide financial grants and technical support to researchers and 
developers who are working on Free Software solutions that contribute 
to the establishment of the Next Generation Internet. As a part of the 
NGI0 consortium, the FSFE is providing support to Free Software projects 
with their legal and licensing issues, as well as introducing them to 
the <a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE specification</a>, a tool 
that can simplify the license process. 
</p>

<p>Currently, <a href="/activities/ngi/ngi.html">the FSFE is working on four NGI0 programs</a>: NGI Entrust, 
NGI Core, NGI Review, and NGI Commons Fund.</p>


<h3>REUSE, make licensing easy </h3>

<p><a href="https://reuse.software/">REUSE</a> helps make a project's licensing 
and copyright status more transparent, ensure that third-party code is 
properly attributed, and make the project's code easily reusable. This 
tool is currently used worldwide and its specification has been adopted 
by several corporate and institutional projects.</p> 

<p>REUSE is constantly evolving and improving. Last June <a href="/news/2024/news-20240620-01.html">the alpha 
version v3.1.0a1 of the REUSE tool was released</a> containing the new 
REUSE.toml functionality, and after the publication of the REUSE Specification v3.2, soon v.3.3 will be 
released. Currently, the tool is in its version v4.0.3.</p> 

<blockquote>"Free Software is an important basis for DLR’s software development 
efforts. There is likely no software project which does not rely on at 
least one Free Software library or uses a Free Software tool to aid in 
the process of software development" -Tobias Schlauch, research software 
engineer at the DLR, <a href="/news/2023/news-20231102-01.html">talking 
about the use of REUSE specification in some of their projects</a></blockquote>

<p>More and more organisations, companies, and individuals are using 
REUSE and benefiting from the growing ecosystem of its specification, 
its helper tool, its API and all the documentation. As using REUSE does 
not require registration, there are not precise numbers about its users 
but we know that it is being adopted by: </p>

<ul>
<li>All 2000+ compliant projects of the REUSE API</li>
<li>
Many projects of the EU-funded Next Generation Internet project we help 
to become REUSE compliant from the start.
</li> 
<li>DLR, the KDE community, and Software Heritage made REUSE the standard for their licensing policy.</li> 
<li>Corporate licensing policies of Siemens, SAP, Huawei, Liferay, and many more.</li> 
<li>Large parts of the Linux Kernel with ~70% by now.</li> 
</ul>

<figure>

<h2 id="young-generation">Reaching Generation Alpha: Youth Hacking 4 Freedom and Ada &amp; Zangemann</h2>

<p>Educating and supporting the young generation in the learning and use 
of Free Software is crucial to the mission of the FSFE. Through our 
activities in this field we are fostering innovation, collaboration, 
and digital literacy in the future. We are supporting a generation that 
can control their technology and empower themselves. The children's 
illustrated book Ada &amp; Zangemann  
introduces the concepts of Free Software to young 
readers, making these complex ideas accessible and sparking curiosity. 
Our Youth Hacking 4 Freedom contest is aimed at teenagers, who want to create, share and improve software.</p> 

<p>With 
these two activities, the FSFE encourages the next generations to 
become active contributors to the digital world, shaping technology, 
rather than mere consumers.</p>

<h3>Youth Hacking 4 Freedom: teenagers coding great ideas</h3>

<p>Young people, from all over Europe, compete in <a href="https://yh4f.org">Youth Hacking 4 
Freedom</a> to win cash prizes by creating programs of their choice 
licensed as Free Software. The six winners are invited to the Award 
ceremony weekend.</p> 

<p><strong>Second edition</strong>: In October 2023 we had the Awards 
Ceremony weekend in Brussels with the winners and members of the jury 
from that edition. <a href="/news/2023/news-20231017-01.html">2023

<p>During this year we also learnt a bit more about some of the 
projects and their developers thanks to our <a href="/tags/tagged-yh4f-project.html">YH4F interviews to 
participants</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Third edition</strong>: In October 2024, we will announce the names of the 
2024 YH4F winners, marking the end of a journey that began at the end 
of 2023 when they registered to take part in this edition. From January 
to the end of June, the participants worked on their projects.  During 
this time, they had the opportunity to meet online once a month and get 
advice from experts while networking with their peers. A broad group of 
technology experts, the YH4F Jury, then evaluated the projects 
submitted at the end of June.</p>

<p>Also during this year we presented this contest in different conferences 
such as <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/8GSutX7VcnGtMiqm3Ng96m">FOSDEM</a>, <a 
href="https://media.fsfe.org/w/inrgdSvLyaPViV7kqjugMr">Chemnitz Linux 
Days</a> and esLibre.</p>

<p>
For the new edition, starting in January 2025, YH4F got a <a

<h3>Ada &amp; Zangemann: Italian, French and Spanish version</h3> 
	
<p>The illustrated book <a href="ada.fsfe.org">"Ada &amp; Zangemann - A Tale of Software, 
Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream"</a> by Matthias Kirschner, the President of the FSFE, tells the story of 
the famous inventor Zangemann and the girl Ada, a curious tinkerer. Ada 
begins to experiment with hardware and software, and in the process 
realises how crucial it is for her and others to control 
technology.</p> 

<figure>

	alt="Ada book in the different languages published" />
</figure>

<p>In recent months, we got a lot of amazing and interesting 
news about Ada, from book readings to new translations to the project 
of making a film of this story.</p>
 
<p>The <a href="/news/2023/news-20230907-01.html">first reading of the 
story of Ada in Italian</a> took place during 
Software Freedom Day and to make it even more special, everyone enjoyed 
home-made ice cream thanks to one of our volunteers!</p>

<p>The story of "Ada &amp; Zangemann" was also published in French and, 
thanks to the French Ministry of Education, you can <a href="https://cfeditions.com/ada">download the ebook 
free of charge</a> or read the <a href="https://ada-lelivre.fr/">mobile 
friendly online version</a>. The book was translated into 
French by more than a hundred students, aged 13 to 19, from four 
different schools in France, over the course of the 2022-2023 school 
year, sharing the work and coordinating it using online tools.</p>
 
<p>The book was covered in a radio <a

by "Radio France"</a>, in 
several articles, including <a 
href="https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/binaire/2023/11/10/les-communs-numeriques-pour-les-jeunes/">Le 
Monde</a>, <a 
href="https://www.zdnet.fr/blogs/l-esprit-libre/ada-zangemann-un-beau-livre-jeunesse-sur-les-logiciels-libres-39963026.htm">ZDnet</a>, 
or <a href="https://www.bortzmeyer.org/ada-zangemann.html">blogs</a>, as 
well as TV 
coverage at Sqool TV with Alexis Kauffmann, from the French Ministry of 
Education and the person who started with the idea of the French 
translation.</p>

<figcaption>Last December the, at that time, French Minister of Education, 
Gabriel Attal, presented the book "Ada &amp; Zangemann" to the French 
German parliamentarians meeting (APFA) in the old Bonn parliament. 
Afterwards he gifted the book to Anke Rehlinger, Minister President of 
the Saarland (Germany).</figcaption>

<p>And even more! The book was awarded the <a 
href="https://mastodon.social/@fsfe/112174693808107429">2024 Youth Book 
Prize of the 
InCyber Forum Europe</a>. This is the first time this prize has been 
awarded to a children's book. And 300 copies of Ada &amp; Zangemann were 
distributed to teachers at the Journée du Libre Éducatif 2024. The book 
was presented at this fair, that this year was held in Paris, by two of 
the students who translated it.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Volkswagen Group in Spain, the story of Ada &amp; 
Zangemann is now being printed in Spanish! The company has distributed 
500 copies to its employees and, from September, its STEM team will be 
embarking on a 'STEM tour', visiting schools in several Spanish cities 
around the country to share the story encouraging children, and 
especially girls, to get into STEM.</p>

<p>To reach even more children, we are currently working to have an 
"Ada &amp; Zangemann" movie produced by a professional 2D animation studio. 
We plan to release the movie in four languages by the end of this year 
as an Open Educational Resource under a Creative Commons Licence, the 
same one that Wikipedia has. Everyone will be able to download and 
share it, use it in schools, and integrate it with other educational 
material, making a difference to the quality of IT education that is so 
vital for young people in our digital society.</p>
 
<p><strong>"They are young + they need the code", the FSFE's format to bring Free Software into the schools (online)</strong></p>

<p>The FSFE's pilot project “They are young + they need the code” is 
inspired by the book "Ada &amp; Zangemann". This educational format, 
designed by the FSFE, helps the children to understand the importance 
of controlling their own technology, through reading the book and 
manual activities. Currently the project is being tested in Italy, and 
we are waiting to hear back from our volunteers, who are bringing the 
format to the schools and libraries.</p>

<h3>Free Software Knowledge IT Project, partnership with Edulife</h3>

<p>At the end of last year, during SFSCON 2023, the FSFE and the 
Edulife Foundation kicked off a <a href="/news/2024/news-20240122-01.html">collaboration project to raise 
awareness</a> about the benefits of Free Software to the next generation of 
innovators.</p>

<p>The project consists in a two-year agreement to deliver educational 
content to students from the ITS Academy LAST about Free Software legal 
aspects, policy and public awareness. Last January, and as part of this 
academic program, the FSFE delivered educational content about 
Free Software, with a focus on Free Software legal issues, policy 
aspects and public awareness in the form of lectures. In addition, again 
this year the students will attend SFSCON.</p>


<h2 id="policy">Policy work: Advocating for Free Software</h2>

<p>Political decisions and policies within the European Union 
significantly impact Free Software, its ecosystems, and its 
communities. For 20 years the FSFE has engaged with policymakers to ensure that the Free Software community's 
voice is heard. Advocating at the European level for software freedom 
is essential to make decision-makers all over Europe understand the 
importance of Free Software in our society.</p> 

<p>This past year has seen the adoption of important pieces of 
legislation which the FSFE has been active on, such as the 
Interoperable Europe Act, the Artificial Intelligence Act, the Product 
Liability Directive and the upcoming adoption of the Cyber Resilience 
Act.</p>

<p>Looking at the future, especially in light of the recent 
developments around the possible cuts of funding directed to Free 
Software projects with the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, 
Free Software funding should be addressed at the European level with 
the institution of a long-term sustainable funding scheme. In the next 
year(s), our policy efforts will be also focused to raise this issue at 
the European level, and we will make sure that uncoordinated, scattered 
and small funding for Free Software will not be the norm any more.</p>


<p><strong>Liability in the AI, PLD and CRA</strong></p>

<p>During the past year, the EU has been debating the introduction of 
liability rules for software, including Free Software, in different 
legislation, namely the AI Act, Product Liability Directive and the 
Cyber Resilience Act. The way they were first proposed, all proposals 
would have harmed the Free Software ecosystem and thus the society and 
the economy.</p>

<p>The main debate around this proposal focused on liability. With 
different wording, the three proposals initially excluded liability of 
Free Software only outside the course of a commercial activity. This 
would have failed to address a large part of software that is deployed 
and at the same time smaller and non-profit projects would have been 
harmed as they would have to bear major costs and face legal risks even 
if there was any kind of commercial activity, like in the case of 
voluntary contributions to code.</p> 

<p>At an early stage, the FSFE argued in a hearing in the EU 
Parliament, for the inclusion of clear and precise exemptions for Free 
Software development in the legislation and for liability to be 
transferred to those who significantly financially benefit from it on 
the market.</p> 

<p>The co-legislators have largely complied with our demands and 
following intensive debates, have significantly improved the 
Commission’s proposal, by introducing an exemption for Free Software 
and including it in the articles of the regulations.</p>

<p>Even if with different wordings, <a 
href="/news/2024/news-20240312-01.html">this position has been voted in 
the PLD and the AI Act</a>, but still needs to be finally voted in the 
CRA.</p>

<p><strong>Interoperable Europe Act</strong></p>

<p>The EU's Interoperable Europe Act aims to improve cross-border 
digital public services. <a href="/news/2024/news-20240206-01.html">The 
FSFE has called on policymakers to recognize the importance of Free Software in 
achieving this goal</a>. Following the <a href="publiccode.eu">"Public Money? Public Code!"</a> 
initiative, we have been emphasizing the need for public 
administrations to have control over the software they use while 
ensuring efficient use of public funds.</p>

<p>Despite efforts to include the Free Software community in the 
decision-making process through the soon to be implemented 
Interoperable Europe Board foreseen by the regulation, the Free 
Software community will only be involved in the Interoperable Europe 
Community. However, this involvement allows our Community to offer 
expertise, highlighting the need to closely monitor the regulation's 
implementation to identify opportunities for effective contributions 
from civil society.</p>

<figure>
<peertube url="https://media.fsfe.org/w/8N57qV4Q8saYmTSEH9JNym"/>
</figure>

<p>While acknowledging some shortcomings and ambiguities in the wording 
of the Act, we welcome certain victories. For instance, the European 
Commission is now required to provide an annual report on Free Software 
interoperability solutions and support actions that promote these 
solutions. These measures will help assess the Act's success in 
prioritizing Free Software and allow us to continue our oversight 
role.</p>

<p><strong>Cyber Solidarity Act</strong></p>

<p>The Cyber Solidarity Act aims at strengthening collaboration among 
EU member states around Cyber Security, in order to strengthen 
solidarity and capacities in the Union to detect, prepare for and 
respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents.</p>

<p>In a hearing at the Committee of the Regions, we highlighted 
that in order to establish trustworthy and resilient systems, public 
bodies must ensure they have full control over the software and the 
computer systems at the core of their state digital infrastructure, and 
this is only possible by prioritizing the use of Free Software.</p>

<figure>
<peertube url="https://media.fsfe.org/w/7GATihc2xRDVfLucVcFcdF" />
</figure>

<p>Furthermore we advocated for the inclusion of civil society in the 
implementation of the act, and we welcomed that legislators agreed on 
including different stakeholders in the legislation.</p>

<p>However, in the recent framework of EU regulations aimed at 
enhancing digital infrastructure security, in the Cyber Solidarity Act, 
legislators failed to recognise the importance of Software Freedom when 
it comes to developing ad-hoc tools.</p>

<blockquote>Political decisions and directions have big impact on Free 
Software, its ecosystems and its communities.It is impossible to 
achieve Device Neutrality, and a free and open internet without the 
commitment of the public sector to maintain a vigorous and sustainable 
ecosystem through policies and funding.That is why it is important that 
we keep educating decision-makers in the importance of software freedom.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Liability, Cybersecurity and Free Software</strong></p> 
<p>The FSFE, along with NLnet Labs and the Open 
Source Security Foundation, submitted <a 
href="https:/news/2024/news-20240715-01.html">feedback on the Network 
and 
Information Security (NIS) implementation act</a>, emphasizing the need to 
protect the European Free Software ecosystem. The NIS2 implementation 
act, which focuses on cybersecurity regulations, also impacts the Free 
Software ecosystem in Europe. It's essential that these measures 
enhance cybersecurity without hindering Free Software development, as 
Free Software is a vital component in this field.</p>

<p>In their joint feedback to the European Commission’s draft NIS2 
Implementing Act on "Cybersecurity risk management &amp; reporting 
obligations for digital infrastructure, providers, and ICT service 
managers," the FSFE and its partners expressed concerns about the focus 
on business-to-business (B2B) relationships. They pointed out that many 
complex software products, central to the digital infrastructure 
sector, are developed by independent individuals, non-profit 
organizations, or academic institutions. In these cases, beyond the 
freedoms provided by Free Software licenses, there is no formal 
relationship between the developer and the entities covered by 
NIS2.</p> 

<p><strong>Public Money?, Public Code! demands at the European Union</strong></p>
<p>The FSFE has also taken part in crucial consultations at the 
European level. For the FSFE it is important to give input in this kind of 
process as it makes the Free Software community’s voice heard, and we 
can make sure the community's demands reach policymakers
in crucial phases of the legislative process.</p>

<ul>
<li>Software Freedom Funding</li> 
<p>In the wake of the recent <a href="/news/2024/news-20240719-01.html">€27 million cut in the NGI funding</a>, the FSFE has responded to the growing concern by asking the community <a href="/news/2024/news-20240911-02.html">to take 
part in a public consultation</a> of the European Commission, which asked for feedback on their Digital Europe funding programme.</p>
<p>The community stressed the<a href=" /news/2024/news-20240911-01.html">urgent need for sustainable, 
long-term financial support for Free Software</a> to ensure Europe's technological independence. Europe 
needs <a href="/news/2024/news-20240808-01.html">sustainable, secure, and dedicated funding</a> to ensure its control over technology through Free Software. 
Much of Europe's digital infrastructure relies on Free Software projects to ensure independence and resilience. 
Reducing or cutting funding threatens Europe's technological autonomy. With the participation of our community in the 
public consultation, we hope that Free Software solutions will receive the long-term funding they need.</p>
<p><em>We will keep you up to date on this issue, as the consultation will be at the end of the process at the 
  time of publication of this report.</em>.</p>
<li>European digital infrastructure needs a Free Software first 
approach</li> 

<p>In its response to the European Commission's 
consultation on the white paper "How to Master Europe’s Digital 
Infrastructure Needs?", <a href="/news/2024/news-20240701-01.html">the FSFE highlighted the vital role Free 
Software plays in creating robust digital infrastructure across Europe</a>. 
We argued that embracing software freedom can address challenges at 
various levels—global, regional, and local—by fostering collaboration, 
openness, and the ability to quickly resolve issues. The FSFE suggested 
redirecting IT investments towards Free Software instead of relying on 
closed-source, proprietary options. This shift would enhance Europe's 
IT landscape, create jobs, and save costs over time by reducing the 
need for redundant solutions.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Consultancy for public administrations</strong></p> 
<p>
The FSFE not only demands Free Software friendly policies but also helps 
administrations across Europe to take concrete steps towards "Public 
Money? Public Code!". Since December 2023, the German Centre for Digital 
Sovereignty of Public Administration (ZenDiS) has contracted the 
services of the FSFE to advise them on Free Software and related issues. 
The scope of our consultancy includes strategies around ZenDiS’ products 
openDesk (the former Sovereign Workplace, a workplace solution for the 
public sector) and OpenCoDE (the code-sharing platform for public 
administrations in Germany), international cooperation and community 
engagement, criteria for Free Software procurement, stakeholder 
analysis, and providing input on topics such as Free Software supply 
chains, Free Software maintenance and fraudulent market behaviour.
</p>
	
<p><strong>Monitoring and watchdog activities as part of "Public Money? Public Code!"</strong></p>

<p>Since the FSFE launched the "Public Money? Public Code!" initiative, 
we have welcomed every step towards more Free Software in public 
administrations. But in the last few years it has become clear that 
this is not enough. That is why FSFE decided to act more like a 
watchdog: While on the one hand we continue to call for Free Software 
friendly policies and point out best practices, on the other hand we 
closely monitor the implementation of Free Software policies and raise 
our voice when we see things going in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>A recent example of this stronger watchdog role is the situation 
around the German IT service provider Dataport and its openwashing 
software dPhoenix for public administrations, which FSFE continued to 
observe and comment on last year. As a result of our communication, 
Dataport stopped promoting dPhoenix as “Open Source” and admitted that 
it is proprietary. A more detailed explanation of the FSFE’s watchdog 
activities can be found in our <a 
href="/news/podcast/episode-22.html">Software Freedom Podcast Episode 
#22 on 
“Public Money? Public Code!”</a>.</p>

<p>Openwashing is a topic the FSFE has been working on intensively over 
the past year. In the context of "Public Money? Public Code!", 
openwashing is not just a case of fraudulent labelling, but also leads 
to taxpayers being misled about how their tax money is being used. As 
we repeatedly receive reports of openwashing among bidders for public 
sector free software tenders, we have conducted a public community 
survey on the topic. We have gathered information, opinions and 
examples about openwashing to better understand the strategies and 
methods behind it, and to be able to come up with suggestions on how to 
tackle it. First results were presented at FrOSCon, together with ideas 
for better Free Software procurement, aiming to avoid pitfalls like 
openwashing, but also other kinds of problematic market behaviour.</p>

When it comes to monitoring the implementation of Free Software 
policies, our tool TEDective can be of great help to analyse, understand 
and visualise the money flows in public tenders.

<h3>TEDective</h3>

<p>During the past months, we have continued working on developing <a 
href="https://tedective.org">TEDective</a>. This is a free software 
solution that makes European public procurement data explorable for 
non-experts.</p>  

<p>This year we got the help of some students that improved the took and added some results.</p>

<ul>
<p>Some of the improvements:</p>
<li>
<a

<h2 id="legal">Legal Support: giving advice to projects and individuals</h2>

<p>At the FSFE we help answer licensing 
questions, provide technical support to make licensing easier (among 
others, with REUSE), provide legal education materials on Free 
Software, and organise an annual conference for the FSFE's legal network, the Free Software 
Legal and Licensing Workshop (LLW). We are also part of several 
EU-funded projects, helping with legal concepts and issues. </p>

<p><strong>ZOOOM project</strong></p> <p> This year, the FSFE completed 
 its work on the European Commission funded <a 
 href="/activities/zooom/zooom.html">ZOOOM Initiative</a>. The aim of 
 this 
 project was to raise awareness of the importance of managing rights and 
 obligations related to Free Software, Open Data, and Open Hardware, 
 especially when doing so in relation to innovation in digital 
 industries.</p>

<p>As part of our work with ZOOOM, the FSFE produced research 
and educational materials on Free Software legal issues, which 
contributed to a larger toolkit on Open Software, Data, and Hardware. 
In addition to the usual discussions regarding Free Software licensing, 
this material also includes analyses on developing trends in digital 
innovation, which primarily focused on Free Software's role in 
developments in large language models, and artificial intelligence. 
This work, along with the work produced by our ZOOOM consortium 
partners on Open Data and Open Hardware, is to be included in 
education, business creation, and innovation programs across the EU 
that aim to build expertise in European small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs).</p>

<p>Another part of our work with the ZOOOM initiative was to promote 
and to disseminate the research that we've conducted on these topics. 
You may have over the past 12 months seen FSFE staffers at various 
conferences across Europe, connecting with local communities and 
raising awareness on the importance of understanding our rights and 
obligations when working with Free Software, as well as with Open Data 
and Open Hardware. Although the project has officially come to a close, 
<a href="https://zooom4u.eu/">the ZOOOM toolkit and training materials</a> are a 
useful tool to promote a healthier ecosystem where Free Software legal 
and licensing obligations are understood and followed across various 
digital industries, and where the ideals of Free Software are 
upheld.</p>


<p><strong>Legal Network and LLW 2024</strong></p>

<p>The FSFE continued to support the Free Software legal community with 
our continued coordination of the <a 
href="/activities/ln/ln.html">Legal Network</a> this year. The Legal 
Network is a global community of legal professionals from diverse 
fields, all working on legal and licensing issues related to Free 
Software. The Legal Licensing Workshop (LLW) provides a neutral and 
safe space for participants to engage in discussions, even on 
controversial topics, fostering mutual learning and collaboration.</p>

<p>This year, our facilitation of the 
Legal Network has led to the discussion and proliferation of legal 
understanding in the international legal community of a number of 
trending topics, including the relevance of Free Software licenses to 
the development of large language models, developments in litigation 
efforts to enforce copyleft in various jurisdictions, as well as the 
ever constant detailed dissection of the effects of various 
licenses.</p>

<p>As part of our support for the legal community, we also organized 
our annual Free Software Legal and Licensing Workshop (LLW) in April 
for the legal professionals on our Legal Network to meet in person to 
present their work, and to discuss legal issues and best practices 
surrounding Free Software legal and licensing issues. As in 2023, this 
year’s event was once again held in Gothenburg, Sweden, at the Chalmers 
Conference Center, over 3 days.</p> 

<p>While the LLW conference is always a 
great opportunity for Legal Network members to share their projects and 
research findings, or to engage in thought provoking discussions on 
both the practical and philosophical aspects of Free Software legal 
practice, this year’s conference was also a great opportunity for 
participants to catch up with one another in person, and to meet new 
Legal Network members. It is the aim of the FSFE that building such 
professional relationships helps to build shared consensus in the 
practice of law related to Free Software across jurisdictions, and to 
reduce friction in the famously prickly legal sphere. We are happy to 
say that with the extremely smooth running of the 2024 edition of the 
LLW, we have been successful in this aim this year.</p>

<p>We look forward to organizing the 2025 edition of the LLW in Essen, 
Germany, at the Unperfekthaus.</p>

<h2 id="public-awreness">Our work on public awareness</h2>

<p>We are deeply committed to raising public awareness of Free 
Software, and our website plays a central role in this effort. It 
serves as a comprehensive resource, providing information about the 
basics of Free Software, our ongoing activities, and our vibrant 
community. In recent months, we have focused on improving the 
attractiveness and usability of the site. In particular, we've 
redesigned the front page and introduced a new categorisation system 
for our publications to make them more accessible to readers. We've 
also revised the structure of our activities page.  Our press site has 
also been redesigned to help journalists find the information they need 
more easily and quickly.</p>

<p>Since September 2023, we have published 55 news items in English, 
our official outreach language, but some of these publications have 
also been translated into other European languages, mainly thanks to our 
awesome team of translators. Besides, we 
publish monthly email updates in which our experts inform our 
subscribers about current news, events, activities, and how you can 
contribute.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>FSFE Press Page</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From a technical standpoint, we have overhauled																		 <a 
href="https://status.fsfe.org/translations/index.html">the translation 
status page</a>. It now displays the files that need translation for each 
language, prioritized by the importance of the files—essentially based 
on how many clicks it takes to reach the page from the front page. The 
status page also links directly to the source files in Git and the 
Webpreview tool, which shows the current translated version. This 
should make it easier to resume translation work. Additionally, for 
some time now, translated pages with a newer English version have shown 
a warning indicating that the translation is outdated. Also, currently 
if a translation is too outdated, instead the EN original will be 
displayed again.</p>

<p>Another technical improvement that we have done these past months 
was in <a href="/events/tools/eventregistration.html">the event 
registration</a>. An event can now be linked to a local or topic group 
and will automatically be added to the group's calendar, which is 
accessible from the group overview page and can be integrated into 
calendar apps via CalDAV, just like other calendars in Nextcloud. For 
proper integration, events now include start and end times. The 
existing ICS file also correctly uses these dates, allowing subscribers 
to see the event times in their feeds. Additionally, events can be 
automatically sent to the group’s mailing list, though this feature 
hasn't been used by any group yet. The process for adding events to our 
events page has also been partially automated—a pull request is 
automatically generated for new events, collecting all language 
versions, and the event filename is adjusted accordingly. This version 
improves clarity, reduces redundancy, and streamlines the explanation. 
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments! </p>

<p>We also have made some progress in the migration from <a 
href="https://wiki.fsfe.org/">wiki.fsfe.org</a> to <a 
href="https://docs.fsfe.org/">docs.fsfe.org</a>, but 
still we need to continue working on it during the next months. Last 
but not least, over the past year we switched from the old ticket system to the new one.</p>

<p>We have also continued with our <a href="/news/podcast.html">Software 
Freedom Podcast</a>. This year we published 4 episodes, which might be a bit less than previous years but the person in charge was on maternity leave for several months in 2024.</p>

<p>This year, in the podcast we talked about <a 
href="/news/podcast/episode-22.html">PMPC</a>, <a 
href="/news/podcast/episode-24.html">the current status of Free Software 
in our society</a> in US and Europe, we had a <a 
href="/news/podcast/episode-23.html">special episode at Christmas</a> 
about "What is Free Software" and we learned about <a 
href="/news/podcast/episode-25.html">MirageOS</a>.</p>

<p>We also have a number of social media channels, the main ones being 
Mastodon and Peertube, where we post more frequently, using the ones 
that are not part of the Fediverse to promote topics and issues related 
with the main audience of those networks.</p>

<h3>I Love Free Software Day</h3>

<p>"I Love Free Software Day" 2024 focused on the younger generations 
and how to introduce them to the Free Software community. Therefore, 
several of our local groups celebrated this day with a meeting focused 
on younger people. </p>

<p>The FSFE planned a special gift for several organisations and 
long-term volunteers to prepare them for I Love Free Software Day. We 
gave them an acrylic glass heart and an LED strip, and a 
microcontroller and some jumper cables. The challenge? To tinker with 
these things and upload a picture of the heart on 14 February. It 
turned out to be quite a challenge, but a lot of fun!</p>

</figure>

<p>For the <a href="/news/2024/news-20240226-01.html">2024 
celebrations</a>, over a hundred people came together in 13 
local meetings - either online or in person - organised by FSFE 
chapters or other Free Software groups in seven different 
countries.</p>


<h3>Merchandising and Info Material</h3>

<p>This year we worked on adding new stickers to our -already- great 
collection.</p> 

<p>At the end of last year, we focused on expanding our already 
impressive sticker collection. With our team's creativity, we developed 
<a href="/contribute/spreadtheword.html">new slogans and 
illustrations</a>, resulting in fresh stickers in a 
variety of colours and formats.</p>

<p>In the months that followed, we attended various conferences and 
events, where we gathered valuable feedback on these new stickers.</p>

<p>We also took the opportunity to refresh our merchandise. By the end 
of 2023, we introduced <a href="/order/index.html">two new T-shirts</a>: a new colour for our classic 
“There’s No Cloud” design and a striking new graphic for the "Hacking 
for Freedom" slogan. Both T-shirts have been well-received, alongside 
another exciting addition to our web shop and event displays—the 
vibrant red “I Love Free Software” socks.</p>

<p>At the start of summer, we ran a successful sale offering free 
shipping for two weeks, resulting in over 100 orders, including several 
large ones.</p>

<h3>Our community</h3>

<p>While our local groups have continued with their activity in their 
local and regional levels, this year we have continued  with the online 
coordinators’ meetings.  Besides organizing booths and being at events 
-even in Asia- our volunteers have also been involved in several 
activities such as PMPC, Ada &amp; Zangemann….</p>

<p>This year we also activated a new local group, that is going to focus on Poland</p>
 	
<p> In Italy, we had a fundraising innitiative, in which we gifted all 
supporters and ex-supporters a copy of the book and informed them about 
the activities happening in Italy.</p>

<p>This year we also spent a nice day with members of the Italian 
community in Bolzano, going on a hike with them the day after SFSCON.
And in the summer we were back at the LinuxHotel for our now 
traditional summer meeting! During a long weekend we spent time with 
volunteers, learning about current work topics and getting feedback. We 
even had time to get to know each other a bit better with some 
networking games and in the evenings.</p>
