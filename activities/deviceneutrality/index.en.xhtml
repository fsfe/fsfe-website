      <p>
        Although digital devices are ubiquitous today, the number of devices on
        which users cannot run Free Software is exponentially increasing. The
        consequence is an increased loss of control over users' technology.
        Device Neutrality aims to enable end-users to bypass gatekeepers to have
        a non-discriminatory use of Free Software on their devices.

    <p>
      We all know the joy of acquiring a new device and the excitement of exploring
      its features and functionalities. Let's imagine the scenario where you
      bought a new smartphone.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are thrilled to learn and discover all that your device can deliver.
      You want to install apps, use the camera, access the internet,
      run games, and enjoy all what your equipment can perform.
      However, soon you start to realise that something is wrong. In
      order to start your phone, you are prompted to create an online account
      for using the device.
     </p>

     <p>
      Further, you begin to perceive how limited you are in downloading and installing new apps and
      programs. The only possible way is via the manufacturer's apps store or marketplace.
      You may be even forbidden to sideload or install third party software,
      including <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/">alternative repositories</a>.
      Most weirdly, you are not allowed to remove pre-installed programs that are
      occupying the device's memory space and unduly draining its battery.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may think this is an issue with the operating system and start searching
      for alternatives. However, your device boots only a specific fully or partly proprietary operating
      system. In other words, you <a
      href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/">cannot install a different operating system</a>. Finally, you sadly realise
      that although your smartphone is a general purpose computer, you are stuck with an
      artificially limited device which performs much less than you expected.
    </p>

        Limitations to Free Software, vendor lock-in, and lack of control over personal
        data are current hurdles faced by end-users in digital markets.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Issues like these, and many others related to browsers, search engines, and
      hardware, are a common occurrence in digital markets. End-users are experiencing
      a severe limitation on their rights and ability to freely use their devices.
      Basic freedoms such as installing and uninstalling software are being unfairly limited
      by these companies, commonly referred to as "gatekeepers", because of their
      monopolistic control over devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Device Neutrality is a policy concept to enable end-users to bypass gatekeepers
      in order to run Free Software and use services independently of the control
      exercised by hardware manufacturers, vendors, and platforms. On this page
      you will learn that Device Neutrality can be achieved by safeguarding
      software freedom in devices, protecting end-users from lock-in,
      and promoting standardised ways of data interoperability.

     <h2 id="general-purpose-computer-free-software">General Purpose Computers and Free Software</h2>

    <p>
      Digital devices are a present reality in all aspects of life. We use them
      for work, communication, entertainment, and internet access. Such devices
      are powerful machines, allowing us to have access to a huge number of
      features and perform an almost infinite number of tasks. Our smartphones,
      tablets, laptops, and other connected devices are <strong>general purpose
      computers</strong>. That means we can potentially run any software we want to
      make full use of the hardware. This potential is fostered by Free Software.
     </p>

     <p>
      Software freedom depends on how we can run
      software in devices. Safeguarding <a
      href="/freesoftware/freesoftware.html">the four freedoms of Free Software</a>
      over operating systems, drivers, app stores, browsers, and any other software is
      crucial not only for freedom of choice, but also for a healthy,
      competitive, democratic and <a
      href="/freesoftware/sustainability/sustainability.html#id-device-neutrality">sustainable</a> 
      digital environment.
    </p>

      <figcaption>
        Everyone should be able to run the software they want on their general purpose computers.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>



    <h2 id="gatekeeper-control-monopoly-devices">Gatekeeper Monopoly over Devices</h2>

    <p>
      Although the devices we use are general purpose computers, device
      manufacturers, vendors, and internet platforms have been restricting
      software freedom by exercising their monopolistic control over end-user
      equipment. This power is used over key features and components of
      devices such as operating systems, browsers, and app stores. Since these elements
      are essential for the functioning of devices, they constitute a
      <strong>termination monopoly</strong>, which grants such companies powers in the
      sense that they could be considered "gatekeepers of gateways" for
      end-users to access and control software, hardware, and services of their devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Manufacturers, vendors, and platforms controlling devices may
      perform a <strong>gatekeeper function</strong> in similar ways to a provider of
      an internet access connection controlling a gateway to the internet. The more
      important the device features and components are for end-users, the more
      entrenched the position of the gatekeeper can become in the digital markets.
     </p>

     <p>
      Monopolised markets are prejudicial to fair competition
      and consumer welfare. With gatekeepers controlling operating systems,
      app stores, browsers, and key online services, end-users are left
      with no or few choices, hindering individual freedoms and self-determination.
      In general terms, gatekeeper control is achieved by:
     </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Restricting Software Freedom</strong>: Gatekeepers limit or prevent users
        installing different operating systems, browsers, app stores, drivers,
        etc. on their devices. They also impose pre-installed apps on users, and
        make their uninstallation impossible.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Locking devices down</strong>: Such companies hinder
        interoperability, exercise tight control over APIs, and apply proprietary
        standards, hampering functionalities and blocking access to drivers and
        hardware.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Increasing switching costs</strong>: Gatekeepers keep users
        in "walled gardens", tie devices to online accounts, bundle app stores,
        and hamper data portability, making it harder for users to switch
        software, devices, and services.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="device-neutrality-free-software">Device Neutrality and Free Software</h2>

    <p>
      The monopolistic power of gatekeepers threatens software freedom, individual
      autonomy, consumer welfare, and digital sovereignty. Device Neutrality
      represents ways to disintermediate the power of gatekeepers and re-establish
      competition in markets and end-user control over devices. Users should be
      able to bypass gatekeepers and have the ability to run Free Software on
      their equipment. Device Neutrality's main goal is to resolve the
      termination monopoly over devices, so users can enjoy software freedom and
      have access to alternative services and content with their devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Re-establishing end-user control over devices and fair competition in digital
      markets requires safeguarding software freedom in devices, protecting end-users
      from lock-in, and promoting end-user control over data.

    </p>


    <div class="icon-grid one-per-row">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <img src="/graphics/icons/autonomy.png" alt="A broken chain" />
          <div>
            <h3 id="dn-software-freedom">Software Freedom</h3>
            <p>
              Blocking end-users' freedom to install, run, and uninstall software on
              their devices is a central source of gatekeepers' control. Although gatekeepers may
	      argue that installing third party software could be potentially harmful to users due to
              security, data integrity, and privacy concerns, in fact commercial
              interests are the main drive to lock users in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead, regaining control over devices requires <a
      		href="/activities/upcyclingandroid/openletter.html">safeguarding
              software freedom</a>. Users should have the ability to install and
              uninstall any software, including operating systems and app
              stores. Besides, gatekeepers should provide the same access
              privileges to third party applications as to the pre-installed ones.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <img src="/graphics/icons/no-lock-in.png" alt="An open lock" />
          <div>
            <h3 id="dn-no-lock-in">No Lock-In</h3>
            <p>
              Keeping users in very restrictive
              environments is another key source of gatekeeper control. Users can only
              access and use different services if their devices can interact and
              communicate with other devices and services. Big tech industry players exercise direct
              control over their customers by locking them into a very limited number
              of proprietary alternatives that operate within a "compatible" but not
              interoperable ecosystem. This results in less freedom for users and
              increasing switching costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, high degrees of interoperability, wide implementation
              of <a href="/freesoftware/standards/index.html">Open
              Standards</a>, and easy access to APIs' specifications and
              functionalities invoked by third party apps are fundamental.
              Equally important, devices should not be bundled with app stores
              and online accounts. Gatekeepers should permit third-party app
              stores and code repositories in their devices. Gatekeepers should
              provide non-discriminatory access to Free Software in their
              stores, and not favour or give undue preference to their own
              products.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <img src="/graphics/icons/transparency.png" alt="An open hand" />
          <div>
            <h3 id="dn-control-over-data">End-User Control Over Data</h3>
            <p>
              Breaking monopolies over
              devices necessarily requires empowering users to control their own data
              on their equipment. Smartphones, smartwatches, and computers are very personal
              equipment which accumulate a large amount of personal and non-personal
              data that users care about. Transferring such data constitutes a switching cost that
              can be decisive in preventing users from exercising their freedom to
              change devices. This is especially problematic for switching between
              operating systems. Besides, the importance of the correlation between
              data and software tends to grow, encompassing further developments with
              artificial intelligence and future technologies, which will create an
              additional layer of complexity for end-users controlling their data.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why end-users should be able to easily transfer personal
              data from apps, operating systems, and devices. Most importantly,
              gatekeepers should be bound to <a
              href="/freesoftware/standards/index.html">Open Standards</a> and
              common interfaces for data transfer.

    <h2 id="dn-reality">Making Device Neutrality a Reality</h2>

    <p>
      Since its genesis, the FSFE has been working to put control over
      technology in the hands of users. Through the years, we have gained
      experience with several dedicated activities focused on how users can keep
      their control over devices. We have been working closely with decision makers,
      communities, and businesses to ensure that end-users are empowered to control
      technology. Our work has been translating the demands for Device Neutrality into
      a vivid reality for digital markets with several dedicated activities and
      initiatives.
    </p>
    
 
    <h3 id="dn-dma">Digital Markets Act</h3>

    <p>
      In 2022, several components of Device Neutrality were included in the
      <a href="/activities/dma/dma.html">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>,
      the European Union's largest initiative to regulate gatekeepers in digital
      markets. Although the law contains the principles for making Device
      Neutrality a reality, its regulations concern only very large platforms.
      The DMA establishes obligations for gatekeepers - “dos” and “don'ts” they
      must comply with - and prescribes fines and penalties for infringements.
      The DMA encompasses several rules concerning Device Neutrality, including
      safeguarding the right to uninstall pre-installed software and several
      measures for preventing lock-in, as well as fostering interoperability and
      end-user control over personal data.
    </p>


    <h3 id="dn-initiatives">Initiatives for Device Neutrality</h3>

   <p>
    Device ecosystems are extremely complex, and enforcing Device Neutrality
    requires dedicated initiatives focusing on specific aspects of how end-users
    use and interact with devices. Through the years, our activities have related
    to several components of Device Neutrality, such as promoting software freedom,
    protecting end-users from lock-in, and fostering self-empowerment related to
    personal data.

      compliance with the DMA, conducting device-related activities, and
      promoting software freedom require a lot of resources.
