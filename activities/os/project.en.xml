    <description>
Lock-in of data is one of the most common techniques to artificially
raise the cost of migration to Free Software. Ensuring the best possible
interoperability through Open Standards is essential in enabling users
to escape vendor lock-in. FSFE's work on Open Standards has the goal of
making sure that people do not have to lose all their data when
migrating to Free Software.
